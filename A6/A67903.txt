THE FIVE YEARS OF KING JAMES, OR, The Condition of the State of England, and
the Relation it had to other PROVINCES.

Written by Sr FOULK GREVILL, late Lord Brook.

LONDON, Printed for W. R. in the year, 1643.

The five years of King James, or the Condition of the State of ENGLAND, and
the Relation it had to other Provinces.
HOwsoever every Kingdom and Commonwealth may be both well and uprightly
governed, and that good men may be the means to support it; yet there can be
no such Commonwealth, but amongst the good, there will be even some evil
persons: these, (whether by nature induced, or through envy and ambition, to
the intent to satisfy their appetites, persuaded) do oftentimes enter into
actions repugnant unto the felicity of good Government and Commonwealths, and
by evil causers and perverse deeds, do secretly and underhand, seek to
hasten and set forward the ruin and decay of the same: These things, because
they happen contrary, and beyond expectation are so much the more remarkable by
how much they are sudden, and unexpected. And from hence it comes, that no
state of government can be said to be permanent, but that oftentimes those are
said to be good, are by little and little converted unto those that be evil,
and oftentimes changed from worse to worse, till they come to utter desolation.

Neither is this alone proper to our Commonwealth, but to all, nor to
foreign Kingdoms, but to our own: for although His Majesty at His coming to
the Crown found us vexed with many defensive wars, as that in Ireland, that
in the Low Countries, and almost public against Spain, auxiliarie in France,
and continually in millitarie employments, although he found it lacerate, and
torn, with diverse factions of Protestants, Papists, and others, from amongst
whom, sprung some evil men, that endeavored to set into combustion the whole
State, yet nevertheless he established a peace, both honorable and
profitable, with all neighbor Princes, and by relation through all Europe; so
that neither our friends, nor our enemies might be either feared or suspected.

After this general peace was concluded, and the working heads of diverse
dangerous Papists were confined to a certain course of life, that is, peace;
they now petition for ^olleration, for releases of vexation, to have liberty of
conscience, and forsooth, because they cannot have these things amongst them,
they contrive a most horrible and devilish plot by gunpowder to blow up the
Parliament, even the whole State and command of this Kingdom, and so at one
puff, to conclude all this peace, and by that means to procure an unruly and
unseemly avarice of this settled government; and this not so much to establish
their own Religion, (for which purpose they pretended it) but to establish
their own power and pre-eminence, and to raise some private Families to
greatness and dignity, that so faction being nourished, and that jurisdiction
established, they might with great facility suppress whom they please, and
support their own State. Thus may we see that settled governments do cherish
in themselves their own destructions, and their own subjects are oftentimes
cause of their own ruin, unless God of his mercy prevent it.

Of the domestic affairs, and of the lascivious course of such on whom the
King had bestowed the honor of Knighthood.
THis evil being discovered by the Lord Mounteagle, and overpassed, diverse
discontents happened, some between the Civilians and Common Lawyers concerning
Prohibitions; And for that there was one Doctor Cowell stood stiffly against the
Lord Cook, diverse discontents were nourished between the Gentry and
Commonaltie concerning Enclosure, and it grew out into a petty Rebellion, which
by the same was conjectured, not to happen so much for the thing it self, as
for to find how the people stood affected to the present State, whereby diverse
private quarrels, and secret combustions were daily breaking out, private
families, one sided against another; and of these, Protestants against Papists,
they thereby endavouring to get a head, and from small beginnings to raise
greater Rebellions and discontents, showed themselves heady, and speaks
publicly, what durst not heretofore have been spoken in corners; in outward
appearance Papists were favored, Masses almost publicly administered,
Protestants discountenanced, dishonest men honored, those that were little
less then Sorcerers, and Witches preferred, private quarrels nourished, but
especially between the Scottish and the English Duells in every secret
maintained, diverse, sects of vicious persons of particular Titles pass
unpunished or unregarded, as the sect of Roaring-boyes, Boneventors, Bravadors,
Guarterers, and such like, being persons prodigal, and of great expense, who
having run themselves in debt, were constrained to run into faction to defend
them from danger of the Law; these received maintenance from diverse of the
Nobility, and not a little as was suspected from the Earl of Northampton;
which persons, though of themselves they were not able to attempt any
enterprise, yet faith, honesty, and other good Arts being now little set by,
and Citizens through lasciviousness consuming their estates, it was likely
their number would rather increase then diminish. And under these pretenses,
they entered into many desperate enterprises, and scarce any durst walk the
streets with safety after nine at night. So to conclude in outward show there
appeared no certain affection, no certain obedience, no certain government
amongst us.

Such persons on whom the King had bestowed particular honors, either through
pride of that, or their own prodigality, lived at high rates, and with their
greatness brought in excess of riot, both in clothes and diet. So our ancient
customs were abandoned, and that strictness and severity that had wont to be
amongst us, the English scorned and contemned, every one applauding strange or
new things, though never so costly, and for the attaining o^ them neither
sparing purse nor credit, that prices of all sorts of commodities are raised,
and those ancient Gentlemen, who had left their Inheritance whole, and well
furnished with goods and chattells, (having thereof kept good houses unto their
sons, lived to see part consumed in riot and excess, and the rest in
possibility to be utterly lost: The holy estate of Matrimony most perfidiously
broken, and amongst many made but a may game, by which means diverse private
families has been subverted, brothell-houses in abundance tolerated, and
even great persons prostituting their bodies, to the intent to satisfy their
appetites, and consume their substance, repairing to the City, and to the
intent to consume their virtues also, lived dissolure lives. And many of their
Ladies and Daughters, to the intent to maintain themselves according to their
dignities, prostitute their bodies in shameful manner; alehouses,
dy^ing-houses, taverns, and places of vice, and iniquity beyond measure
abounding in many places, there being as much extortion for sin, as there is
racking for Rents; and as many ways to spend money as are windings and
turnings in towns and streets, so that to outward appearance, the evil seem
to over top the good, and evil intentions and counsels rather prospered, then
those that were profitable to the Commonwealth.

Of my Lord of Northamptons coming to honor, the cause of the division
between the Hollanders and the English, between the Scottish and English,
between the English and Irish
NOw Henry Howard, youngest son of the Duke of Norfolk, continuing a Papist
from his infancy unto this time, beginning to grow eminent, and being made
famous heretofore for his learning, having been ^rained and brought up a long
time in Cambridge, by the persuasion of the King, changes his opinion of
Religion in outward appearance, and to the intent to reap unto himself more
honor became a Protestant, for which cause, he was created Earl of
Northampton, and had the Kings favors bountifully bestowed upon him; first,
the office of Privie-seale, then the Wardenship of Cinque Ports, and lastly the
refusal of being Treasurer: This man was of a subtle and fine wit, of a good
proportion, excellent in outward courtship, famous for secret insinuation, and
for cunning flatteries, and by reason of these flatteries, became a fit man for
the conditions of these times, and was suspected to be scarce true unto his
Sovereign; but rather endeavoring by some s^cret ways and means, to set
abroad new plots for to procure innovation. And for this purpose it was thought
he had a hand in the contention that happened amongst the Hollanders and
English concerning the Fishing, the Hollanders clayming right to have the
Fishing in the Levant, and the English claiming right; upon this contention,
they fell from claim, to words of anger; from words of anger, to blows; so
that there dyed many of them, and a star was left for further quarrel, but
that it was salved by wise Governors, and the expectation of some disappointed.

Nevertheless the Papists, being a strong faction, and so great a man being
their favourer, grew into heads malice, and endeavor to make the insolency of
the Scotts to appear, who to this intent that they might be the more hated of
the English, not contented with their present estate, would enter into
outrages; some count^rfeit the seal Manuell, others quip the Nobility in
disdain, and a third sort secretly contrive the English death, whereby it
happened besides common clamor, that there were added secret discontents of
private persons, which caused jealousy to happen in those two Nations. But His
Majesty, being both wise and worthy, foresaw the evil, and prevented it by
Proclamation, by which means these clamors are stopped, and the injury and
offenses of both parties redressed. The Irish seeing these sores, and hearing
of these misdemeanors (for they have their intelligents here also) begin to
grow obstinate, and make religion a pretense to color their intentions; for
which cause they stand out, and protest loss of life and goods, rather then to
be forced from their opinion, being wavering and unconstant, rather thirsting
for Rebellion, to the intent to purchase their own liberty, then peace; every
new alteration gives occasion of discontent, and causes new complaints to be
brought to the Kings ear, under pretense whereof they grew contemptuous to
their Governors, and haters of the English Laws.

The Captains and Soldiers grew negligent for want of pay, the great men
envying one another through private covetousness, and many insolences being
suffered, causes there also to be nourished many misdemeanors to the ruin of
that Government.

These things being thus handled, administers occasion to the Papists to hope
for some alteration and change. And that as a body that is violent consumes it
self, without some special cause to maintain it, so these occurrents will be
the cause of their own destruction: At this time there was a Leaguer in
Denmark, and shortly after another in the Low Countries, but to what end their
beginnings were intended is yet unknown.

The rising of the Earl of Somerset; his favor and greatness with the King,
and his Parentage, and discontent.
AMong other accidents that happened about these times, the rising of one
Master Carre, was most remarkable; a man borne of mean parentage, inhabitant
in a Village near Edenborough in Scotland, and there, through the favor of
friends, was preferred to His Majesty to be one of his Pages, for he kept
twelve, according to the custom of the French, and so continued it so long as
he was in Scotland; afterward coming into England, the Counsel thought it
more honorable to have so many Footmen to run with His Majesty, as the Queen
had before; these Youths had clothes put to their backs according to their
places, and 50^. a piece in their purses, and so were dismissed the Court.

This youth amongst the rest, having thus lost his fortunes, to repair them
again, makes haste into France, and there continued until he had spent all
his means and money; So that now being bare in a strange country without
friends, or hope to obtain his expectation, returns back for England,
bringing nothing with him but the Language, and a few French fashions;
nevertheless by the help of some of his country men, and ancient
acquaintance, he was preferred unto the Lord Haies a Scotchman, and favorite
of the Kings, to wait upon him as his Page: not long after, that Lord amongst
many others was appointed to perform a Tilting, who bearing an affection to
this young man, as well in respect he was his country man, as that he found him
to be of a bold disposition, comely visag'd, and of proportionable personage
commixt with a courtly presence, preferres him to carry his devise to the King,
according to the custom in those pastimes used; Now when he should come to
light from off his Horse to perform his Office, his Horse starts, throws him
down, and breaks his Leg: this accident being no less strange then
sudden in such a place, causes the King to demand who he was, answer was made
his name was Carre, he taking notice of his name, and calling to remembrance,
that such a one was his Page, causes him to be had into the Court, and there
provided for him, until such time as he was recovered of his hurt, after in
process of time, the young man is called for, and made one of his Bedchamber
to His Majesty, he had not long continued in his place, before (by his good
endeavors and diligent service in his Office) the King showed extraordinary
favor unto him, doubling the favor of every action in estimation, so that
many are obscured, that he may be graced and dignified.

Thus the hand of the diligent makes rich, and the dutiful servant comes to
honor, he of all other (either without fraud to obtain, or desert to continue
it) is made the Kings favorite, no suit, no petition, no grant, no l^tter, but
Mast^r Carre must have a hand in it; so that great rewards are bestowed upon
him by su^tors, and large sums of money by His Majesty; by which means his
wealth increased with his favor, and with both, Honors: for virtue and riches
dignifie their owners, being from a Page raised to the dignity of Knighthood:
After his favor increasing with his honors, there was no demand but he had
it, no suit but he obtained it, whether it were Crown, lands, lands forfeited
or confiscated; nothing so dear but the King bestowed upon him, whereby his
revenues were enlarged, and his glory so resplendent, that he drowned the
dignity of the best of the Nobility, and the eminency of such as were much
more excellent. By which means envy (the common companion of greatness)
procures him much discontent, but yet passing through all disadventures,
continues his favor: and men being drawn to applaud that which is either
strange or new; began to sue him, and most to purchase him to be their friend
and assistant in Court: so great and eminent was his favor.

Of the breach that happened between the Earl of E^^ex and his Countess, her
hatred toward him, his lenity, her lightness, his constancy.
Now the cares of the vulgar being filled with the fortunes of this gentleman,
it ministers occasion to pass to their opinions, concerning his worth and
desert; some extol and laud his virtues, others the proportion of his
personage, many his outward courtship, and most as they stood affected, either
praised or dispraised him, insomuch that amongst the rest, the Countess of
Essex, (a woman of this time did not greatly affect her Husband) and withal,
being of a lustful appetite, prodigal of expense, covetous of applause,
ambitious of honor, and light of behavior, having taken notice of this young
gentleman's prosperity, and great favor that was showed toward him above
others, in hope to make some profit of him, most advances him to every one,
commending his worth, spirit, audacity, and agility of body, so that her
ancient, lawful, and accustomed love toward her Lord begins to be obscured,
and those embraces that seemed heretofore pleasing, are turned into frowns,
and harsh unseemly words usher her discontents unto her husbands ears.

The good Earl carrying an extraordinary affection toward her, and being a
man of a mild and courteous condition, with all honest and religious care, ready
rather to suffer then correct these outrages, patiently admonishes her to a
better course of life, and to remember, that now all her fortune depends upon
his prosperity, and therefore she offered more injury to her self, then hurt
unto him: yet nevertheless she persisted, and from bare words returned to
actions, thereby giving people occasion to pass their censure of this
disagreement; some attributing it to the inconstancy and looseness of the
Countess, others to the Earls travailes, and that in his absence she
continued most unconstant, of a loose life, suffering her body to be abused,
and others to make shipwreck of her modesty, and to abrogate the rights of
marriage, but most because she could not have wherewith, to satisfy her
in^atiate appetite and ambi^ion, her husband living a private life.

For these causes, I say, she run at random, and played her pranks as the toy
took her in the head, sometimes publicly, sometime privately, whereby she
disparaged her reputation, and brought her self into the contempt of the
world; yet notwithstanding, the Earl retained her with him, allowed her
honorable attendance, gave her means according to her place, and showed an
extraordinary affection, endeavoring rather by friendly and fair persuasions
to win her, then to become super^idious over her.

But these things little avail, where affections are carried to another scope,
and those things that to the judgment of the wise become fit to be used, are of
others contemned and despised, so that almost all men speak of the looseness
of her carriage, and wonder that the Earl will suffer her in those courses;
whereupon he modestly tells her of it, giving her a check for her inordinate
courses, showing how much it both dishonored him, and disparaged her in
persisting in the eye of the world after so loose and unseemly a sort^ desiring
her to be more civil at home, and not so often abroad, and thus they parted.

Of my Lord Treasurers death; of Master Overburies coming out of France; his
entertainment, he grows into favor.
MY Lord Treasurer Cecill growing into years, having been a good Statesman,
the only supporter of the Protestant faction, discloser of treasons, and the
only Mercury of our time, having been well acquainted with the affairs of
this Commonwealth, falls into a dangerous sickness, and in process of time,
through the extremity of the malady dies, not without suspicion of poison,
according to the opinion of some, others say of secret disease, some naturally,
and many not without the privitie of Sir Robert Carre, and the reason of their
opinion was, because the King upon a time having given Sir Robert the sum of
twenty thousand pounds to be paid by my Lord Treasurer, Sir Robert Carre was
denied it, upon which denial, there grew some difference bet^^^ne them; the
King was privy to it after this manner, my Lord having told out five thousand
pounds, laid it in a passage Gallery: the King demands whose money that was,
answer was made by my Lord Treasurer, that it was but the fourth part of that
which His Majesty had given unto Sir Robert Carre; whereupon the King retired
from his former grant, and wished Sir Robert to satisfy himself with that,
holding it to be a great gift: he being thus crossed in his expectation,
harbor'd in his heart the hope of revenge, which after happened (as was
suspected) but it is not certain, therefore I omit it.

Upon the death of this gentleman, one Master Overbury (sometimes a Student of
the Law in the Middle Temple) was newly arrived out of France, who having
obtained some favor in Court beforetimes, because of some discontents, got
license to travel, and now at his return, was entertained into the favor of
Sir Robert Carre; whether it proceeded of any love toward him, or to the
intent to make use of him, is not certain; yet nevertheless he puts him in
trust with his most secret employments: In which he behaves himself honestly
and discreetly, purchasing by his wise carriage in that place, the good
affection and favor not only of Sir Robert, but of others also. In process of
time this favor procures profit, profit treasure, treasure honor, honor
larger employments, and in time better execution: For where diligence and
humility are associate in great affairs, there favor is accompanied with
both, so that many Courtiers, perceiving his great hopes, grew into familiarity
with him; the Knights expectations are performed, and his business
accomplished, rather more then less, according to his wishes: So that taking
notice of his diligence to outward appearance, gives him an extraordinary
countenance, uniting him into friendship with himself, in so much that to the
show of the world, his bond was indissolvable, neither could there be more
friendship used, since there was nothing so secret, nor any matter so private,
but the Knight imparted it to Master Overbury.

Of Mistress Turners life, how the Countess and she came acquainted. The
combination of the Earls death.
THe Countess of Essex having harbored in her heart envy toward her husband
even until this time, makes her repair unto Mistress Turner, (a Gentlewoman
that from her youth had been given over to a loose kind of life) being of a low
stature, fair visage, for outward behavior comely, but in prodigality and
excess most riotous; by which course of life she had consumed the greatest
part of her husbands means, and her own; so that now wanting wherewith to
fulfill her expectations and extreme pride, falls into evil courses, as to the
prostitution of her body to common lust, to practice sorcery and enchantments,
and to many little less then a flat Bawd; her husband dying, left her in a
desperate estate, because of her wants; by which means, she is made apt to
enter into any evil accord, and to entertain any evil motion, be it never
so facinerous: A Doctors wife, who was during his life her Physician, and in
that time she having entertained into her company, his said wife by that
means procured further acquaintance, being near of the said disposition and
temperature, as Pares cum paribus facile congregantur; from thence it happened,
that she was suspected even by her means and procurement before this, to have
lived a loose life, for who can touch pitch and not be defiled? I say, having
some familiarity with this woman, and now taking some discontent at her husband
more than heretofore, by reason of her falling out with him, and his sharp
answers (as he conceives) to her, repaires to her house, and there amongst
other discourses, disgorges her self against her husband, whereby the cause of
her grief might easily be perceived. Mistress Turner, as feeling part of her
pain, pities her, and in hope of profit, being now in necessity and want, is
easily drawn to effect any thing that she requires, whereupon by the report
of some, it was concluded at this time between them to administer poison to
the Earl, but not taking effect according to their expectation, the Countess
writes unto her to this purpose.

Sweet Turner, as thou have been hitherto, so art thou all my hopes of good in
this world: My Lord is as lusty as ever he was, and has complained to my
brother Howard, that he has not layne with me, nor used me as his wife.
This makes me mad, since of all men I loath him, because he is the only
obstacle and hinderance, that I shall never enjoy him whom I love.

The Earl having overpast this evil, and continuing still in his prestine
estate, procured not any affection, but more hatred and loathsomeness, so that
it burst forth daily to my Lords great discontent, and draws her headlong into
her own distraction.

Sir Robert Carre made Viscount Rochester, the acquaintance between my Lord of
Northampton and him, the new affection of the Countess.
THe King taking great liking to this young Gentleman, to the intent that he
might be no less eminent in honor, then he was powerful in wealth and
substance, adornes him with the title of Viscount Rochester, bestows the
Secretariship of State upon him, so that his honor and his wealth makes him
famous to foreign Nations. These things coming to my Lord of Northamptons
ears, having been a long time Favorite in Court, and now grown into years,
and by reason thereof, knowing the favor of the King to depend upon many
incertainties; and although at this time he was the greater actor in State
affairs, yet if this young man continued his height of glory, all his dignity
would either be abated, or overshadowed, and that he had not that free access
to the Kings ears, which he had wont to have, endeavors as much as in him
lies to make this Courtier either to be wholly his, or dependent upon his
favor, that so having relation to him, he might make use of his greatness.
And for this purpose he begins to applaud the wisdom and government of the
Viscount, his virtues, outward Courtship, comely carriage, and to conclude,
holding him a man of no less worth and desert, then any about the King,
neither were these things spoken to private or particular persons alone, but
even in the ears of the King, to the intent to confirm the Kings favor
toward him.

These things coming to this gentleman's ears, takes it as a great favor from
so great a personage, and therefore so much the more admires his own worth,
raising his carriage above his wonted course, and in hope of better things,
applauding every action is performed by the Earl, by which means there grows
a kind of community betweeme them, and there wants nothing but intercourse of
speech for confirmance of acquaintance, and procuring further relation either
to other. Time offers opportunity; the Earl and he meets, each changes
acquaintance with acquaintance of greater familiarity, so that many times
letters passed between them in their absence, and courtly discourses being
present, by which means on all hands a confident amity is concluded.

In these times the Countess of Essex being a spectator of those, and
perceiving this Viscount to be still raised up unto honors daily; in hope of
greater, is the more fired with a lustful desire, and the greater is her
endeavors by the instigation of some of her friends to accomplish what she
determined: for greatness does not quallifie, but set an edge upon lustful
appetites, and where the most means are to maintain it, there the greater
affections are cherished.

The course she takes to procure affection; she combines with Doctor Forman;
they conclude to bewitch the Viscount.
IN these furious fits, she makes her repair to Mistress Turner, and begins a
new complaint, whereby she makes manifest an extraordinary affection toward
this young gentleman, so that she could not rest without his company, neither
knew she any means to attain her ends, there being no relation nor
acquaintance between them: whereupon Mistress Turner, being still her second,
and ready to put any evil attempt into execution, concludes with the Countess
to inchant the Viscount to affect her; And for this purpose they fall
acquainted with one Doctor Forman, that dwelt at Lambeth, being an ancient
Gentleman, and thought to have skill in the Magic Art: This man by rewards and
gifts was won to join with Mistress Turner, who now to the intent to prey upon
the Countess, endeavor the best they may to enchant the Viscounts affection
toward her: Much time is spent, many words of witchcraft, great cost in making
Pictures of wax, crosses of silver, little babies for that use, yet all to
small purpose; At length they continuing in their Sorcery, advised her to live
at Court, where she had free access without control, though of small
acquaintance with him whom she most respected, nevertheless, showing an
aff^ble countenance toward him, hoping in process of time to attain that
she required. Time offers opportunity, and amongst other, at length these two
fall into league, the Countess being joyful of her prey, admires him, uses
all kindness that may be to entrap him: He, whether by these enchantments, or
by the lightness of his own disposition carried, is as much besotted,
numbering her amongst the best women, and doubling every action in his
estimation, in so much, that he could scarce rest but in her company,
whereupon their meetings grew frequent, and discourses pleasant, by these
means inflaming the fire of a lustful appetite.

These things having happened so well to her expectation, causes a greet love
toward these good couple, (viz.) Doctor Forman, and Mistress Turner,
soliciting them with Letters, with money, and large promises, to continue
still their friend, they willing to make use of their wealth, more then
expecting any good they could accomplish by their Art, persist amongst her
employments: Mistress Turner makes trial for her self, by which means, many
sleights and accustomed tricks are practiced, and now reported to return to
the hurt of many; for a woman's hands being once entered into the act of sin,
runs headlong to her destruction, turning those evil acts to evil ends, and
endeavoring to purchase by that means profit and commodity.

How it was thought the Earl of Northampton had a hand in the business.
Invites the Viscount to supper. The Countess and he meets; places of meetings
are appointed. The Earl made Chancellor of Cambridge.
IT was vulgarly opinionated, that the Countess of Essex having sustained
these discontents with her husband, acquainted her Uncle, the Earl of
Northampton, of her affection especially toward the Viscount, who weighing the
profit that might redound to his own employments, if there were such affinity
had between them, ^eemed to give a liking toward it, and endeavored rather to
further it, then at all to dissuade her, or giving her that honest and good
counsel to be dutiful to her husband, as was fitting. Howsoever the first
meeting that they had, wherein there was any conference, was at the Earls
house, who invited the Viscount to supper, and there finding the Countess,
they at their pleasure appointed meetings for further discourses. But whether
there was any one made privy to these things it is not evident.

But from this time the Countess and Viscount continued their loose kind of
life, and as was commonly suspected, had further relation then was fitting, to
the great disparagement of them both, and dishonor of so noble a House; what
the issue of these things are continue in obscurity, notwithstanding the Earl
of Northampton is much blamed, the Countess defamed, and the Viscount himself
for his looseness suspected.

Now was this Lord propounded at the Regent house to be Chancellor of
Cambridge, the Scholars fall into diverse opinions, and the Ramists propound
the Prince, to oppose him; this election passed of the Earls side, he refuses,
but still flatters the Scholars, makes the King acquainted with it, and though
willing to undertake it, yet showing an unwillingnesse, endeavored rather to
be urged to it, then receive it voluntarily; this was imputed, because of his
oppose to the Prince, but the truth was to perceive, whether the Scholars
affections were settled upon love and respect unto himself, or merely to
depend upon his greatness. The King writes in his behalf to the
Vicechancellor. They proceed to the new election, the Earl again is chosen,
his title sent him, and he in requital sends many and plausive Letters, and
that they might be the more acceptable, being sent to Scholars, wrote to them
in Latin, it is intolerable the flattery that he used.

Overbury grows into grace with the King; is made Knight. The intercourse
between the Countess and the Viscount made known to Overbury.
AFter some continuance of time, Master Overbury grows eminent in Court, as
well by reason of the Viscounts favor, as the good and careful diligence that
he had in Court employments; so that now comparing his worth with his wealth,
he is had in more respect, and the honor of Knighthood bestowed upon him,
with the hope of better things; this howsoever in it self it be not valuable,
yet in speculators it strikes a doubt, especially in the Viscount, for
sovereignty and love can abide no Paragon.

Things that at the beginning proceed with modesty, are little or nothing
regarded. But when men grow old in such things that are hateful, they make
every place alike with a blushlesse face, committing them to the open view: By
this means Overbury came acquainted with this intercourse between the
Viscount and the Countess: for now they having had some time of familiarity
and intercourse in remote parts, shame not to commit the sin of venery in the
Court, and that to the privity of Sir Thomas, who both loathes and hates what
he sees, avoiding rather then intruding himself to the knowledge of it,
neither meddles he any way or other with it, but lets them alone in their
vicious courses, and rather seems to be ignorant, then take any notice of it.

Nevertheless, he is employed to carry Letters to and again between the
Countess and the Viscount, some to Paternoster-row, some to Hammersmith, and
others to other places of meeting, which were appointed between them, by which
means comparing both actions together, he entered into the secrets of this
mystery, and became acquainted with more things then the Viscount would have
had him, from whence a kind of jealousy was carried toward him.

Of the second complaint of the Earl of Essex. The Countess combines with
Turner to bewitch him^ it takes effect. Formans death: One Gresham is
entertained into the business.
NOw the Earl of Essex perceiving himself to be rather less regarded, then
any whit at all esteemed, enters into a new discourse with his Lady, with many
protestations both of his constancy and love toward her; but with all tells
her o^ her looseness, of the report of the vulgar, and what a strange course
of life she led, contrary to all piety and honesty, which stung the Countess
to the heart, and more increased and augmented her m^lice toward him, so that
in a great fury, she takes her coach, and repairs to her ancient acquaintance
Mistress Turner, who according to her old custom, is ready to perform any
evil act, and there they combine to bewitch the Earl, and procure frigidity
quoad hanc: for this purpose Doctor Forman for the procuring of means,
pictures in wax are m^de, crosses and many strange and uncoth things (for what
will the devil leave unattempted to accomplish their ends?) many attempts
failed, and still the Earl stood it out. At last, they framed a picture of
wax, and got a thorn from a tree that bare leaves, and stuck upon the privity
of the said picture, by which means they accomplished their desires.

This being done according to her expectation, she repaires to her house at
Chartley, and thither the Earl comes to her, but whether he was more lusty
then she expected, or what other accident happened, it is unknown:
nevertheless she grew jealous of her art, and falls into a great fear, that
all their labor was lost, whereupon she writ a Letter to Doctor Forman to this
effect: Sweet Father,
although I have found you ready at all times to further me, yet must I still
crave your help, wherefore I beseech you to remember, that you keep the
doors close, and that you still retain the Lord with me, and his affection
toward me; I have no cause but to be confident in you, although the world be
against me, yet heaven fails me not, many are the troubles I sustain, the
doggednesse of my Lord, the crossenesse of my enemies, and the subversion of my
fortunes, unless you ^y your wisdom do deliver me out of the midst of this
wilderness, which I entreat for Gods sake.

From Chartley, Your affectionate loving daughter, Francis Essex.




This Letter coming to the hands of the old Master, procures a new attempt, and
now he goes and inchants a Nutmeg and a Letter, and to be given to the Viscount
in his drink, the other to be sent unto him as a present; These things being
accomplished, he not long after dyed, leaving behind him some of those Letters,
whereby the Countess had intercourse with him in his Pocket, which gave some
light into the business, amongst which this same was one.

Doctor Forman being dead, Mistress Turner wanted one to assist her, whereupon
at the Countess her coming up to London, one Gresham was nominated to be
entertained into this business, and in process of time was wholly interessed
in it. This man was had in suspicion to have had a hand in the Gu^powder
Treason, he wrote so near in his Alm^nack, but without question he was a very
skillful man in the Mathematics, and in his later time in witchcraft, (as now
suspected) and therefore the fitter to be employed in those practices, which as
they were devilish, so the devil had a hand in them.

The Countess sends the Viscount this Letter enchanted by Doctor Forman:
Places of meetings appointed, their intolerable looseness. Poets verses upon
them. The beginning of the Fall.
Upon her return she sends gratulations to the Viscount, and with those the
Letter sent her by Doctor Forman, he reads it, and the more he reads it, the
more is entangled: For no man knows the miseries that are contained in evil
Arts, and who can withstand the words of evil tongues; whereupon he returns
answer, and new places of meetings are assigned, amongst the rest, one at
Hammersmith: In the mean time the Viscount makes dispatch of his business,
leaving things half done, half undone, to the intent he might meet her, who
had now stayed for hi^ coming above two hours, and being met, they solemnly
saluted each other; fall into diverse discourses, and insinuating phrases, from
words to deeds, and from speaking, to acting the sin of venery. The Countess
having obtained that she desired, and the Viscount caught in the net of
adulation, the more he strives to be loosed, is caught the faster, so that lust
having by this means got liberty, being covered with greatness, like a fire
long concealed in a pile of rotten wood, burst forth with all looseness and
licenciousnesse; places of more frequent and private meetings being concluded
between them, persons fit^ing for their purposes being acquainted with their
proceedings; watchwords are given. All things having relation to a certain
end, makes them more boldly and safely to accomplish that which both time and
memory cannot demonstrate in former History.

Now these good parts which seemed heretofore to be hopeful in the Viscount,
consumes to cinders, and the corruption remains to brand him in the forehead
for his ill living; his modesty becomes eclipsed, his behavior light, his
carriage unseemely in his place, nothing so costly, no tire so uncoth, but at
all costs and charges he obtaines it for the increase of favor; new fashions
are produced, that so he might show more beautiful and fair, and that his
favor and personage might be made more manifest to the world, and for this
purpose yellow bands, dusted hair, curled, crisped, frisled, slicked skins,
open breasts beyond accustomed modesty, with many other inordinare attires
were worn on both sides to the show of the world, so that for the increase of
dishonest appetites, they were abundantly practiced and praised.

Surfeiting thus upon pleasure, having been before accustomed unto hardness,
causes him to fall into all manner of forgetfulness; letting all things go to
wrack, careless in attendance, neglecting State affairs, ignorant of his own
worth, and subjecting himself to the lustful appetite of an evil woman,
accompring no time so well spent, nor hour deemed so happy, as when dalliance
and pleasant discourses past between them; either in words or writings, so that
in him may be verified the old saying of the Poet. Non facili juvenum multis e
millibus unum
Virtuti pretium, qui putat esse suum,
Fallit eum vicium specie virtutis and umbra
Cum sit triste habitum vultuque vest Severum,
Nec dubio tanquam fruge laudatur avorum.
Of thousand youths there scarce is one
That virtue valueth as his prize,
For vic^ deceives him and alone
The show of virtue blinds their eyes,
Although their countenance pensive be,
Their garments and their habits grave,
Yet all their fruit doubtless we see
Is lust and glory that they crave.


These things lays him open to the ill affection of them that hate him, and
lays the foundation of his utter subversion, since the eyes of all men are
upon such as are eminent; and as black upon white is soonest discerned, so
evil conditions and lascivious affections are soonest perceived in such
persons.

The faithfulness of Sir Thomas Ove^bury unto the Viscount, the advice he gave
him contemned. Favou^s are more bestowed upon him; ma^e of the Privy Counsel.
THis course of life being somewhat strange to those that were ignorant of
these designs, gives new occasion of wonder and admiration, how he should
continue still his favor; many things being le^t undone, others done to the
half, insomuch that all must lie upon Overbu^y's neck, and this does he
honestly, and to the Viscounts credit, attributing every action to his doing,
although of him neglected: Answers for him in his absence, hastens dispatches
in his presence, furthers the requests of suitors, and through the neglect and
carelessness of the Viscount, grows in greater credit and esteem, so that his
carfulness, sufficiency, and diligence, makes him become eminent, and beloved
both of the King and Counsel.

Yet nevertheless he lessens his own worth, gives all the dignity to the
Viscount, endeavoring how the p^opl^ stood affected toward him, finds many
complaints and some injuries to be done unto him, who being blinded with
pleasure, overslip^ or lets them pass with small respect; whereupon he takes
occasion at a time convenient, to utter these or the like words unto him: [Sir,
howsoever other things may pass either with small regard, or be smothered with
honor, and greatness; yet such things as lay a man open to obloquie and
contempt, can hardly be obscured in a person so public and eminent as your
Lordship is, which things are often esteemed to be in a man that outwardly
seems light and effeminate, or inwardly wants the ballast of government to
poise eternal actions.

Of a truth Sir (be it spoken without offense) the Court calls your modesty
into question, and fears that these honors that should be hereditary to noble
personages, will be obscured with eminent e^ills, and blemished wit^ levitie
and inconstancy.] These with many other discourses h^ving at this time past
betwee^e t^em, sound^d something h^rshly in the Viscounts ears, as all good
counsel becomes evil, to those that are evil. And in a kind of anger flung
from him, though undeserved, yet nevertheless all his countenance and favor
was not wholly obscured, but that he might still enjoy that which he expected,
which was hope of preferment.

More fa^ours are bestowed upon the Viscount, being called to be one of the
Privy Counsel, which honor, howsoever it was great, and more then was
expected; yet because he was young, one that to the opinion of the world was of
no education, literature, and experience, (besides these inordinate courses)
brings him into further contem^t of the world, so that every m^n would take the
freedom of his Language, and spe^ke harsh^y of these proceedings: some
con^emning his course of life, others his insufficiency, because of his youth,
and most his w^nt of experience, by which means hi^ greatness overtops his
substance; And as a Ship without ballast is tottered too and again, to the
terror of those that are in it in a storm and high water; Even so these
honors thus sudd^inly bestowed upon him before his due time, lays him the
more open to the evil opinion of the envious, and with some does sooner hasten
his ruin: For which cause, it behooves such as are thus drawn up merely by
fortune, either to be possessed with such ^irtues aforehand, that thereby they
might maintain themselves in their greatness, or else to expect a sudden
overthrow at a time unexpected.

B. 2. Speeche^ of the Lady Elizabeth's Marriage with the Palsgrave: Conditions
concluded upon. A. 1. The Prince takes dislike at the Viscount. The Princes
death, rumors upon the same.
NOw Prince Henry was living, and having some intelligence of this loose king
of life which the Viscount led, and being something jealous of him, for because
of that he heard, does uterly dislike him, forbeares his company, and whether
for that or some other cause, it is unknown, falls flat at o^ds with him, not
once giving him any countenance, or vouchsafeing him his countenance.

Not long after, as it might be about the beginning of November, he fell sick,
continued so some week or little more, the malady increasing (lying in his
head) he dies. A man may say of this Prince as was said of Mecaenas, both for
wisdom and strength of body, There was not the like to be found among the
English: The hope of England, strange was the accident, and many the rumors
that ensued upon his death. Some said that a French Physician killed him,
others that he was poisoned, again others thought that he was bewitched; yet
no certainty could be found, but that he dyed a natural death. This accident
filled all the Kingdom with lamentations, and caused the Wedding that followed
at Candlemas after to be kept in sable. The Funeral was performed in great
state, and with more grief; much might be said, but I leave it. My purpose
being only in brief to set out these matters to memory, that after-ages might
see the evil of our times, where the greatest part of many Courtiers actions
are to find out tricks, how to circumvent their fellow servants, and some, (if
it were possible) to dispossess the King of his dignity, as hereafter shall be
showed; so many are ^he discontents that are cherished among them.

These domestic affairs having thus happened, and the death of the Prince
filling the Court with sorrow, and the Court being full of other employments,
by reason of the Marriage that was to be had with the Palsgrave of Rhine, and
her grace, (who was now marriageable) past over the rest in silence. The match
is concluded, and great expectation and provision for his coming over to
perform the ceremonies of matrimony are made, at whose coming, many rumors are
spread abroad. First, that the Spaniard took this to the heart, and therefore
laid to do him some mischief by the way.

That there was a Ship of pocket Pistolls came out of Spain, and that it was
intended by the Papists to have made a Massacre. And that Northampton did
utterly oppose this match, for he was as great an enemy to the Dutch and
Protestants, as ever Cicell was their friend; and that many Priests were
arrived, and such like; yet nevertheless it was accomplished with great Pomp
and state, all or the greatest part of the Nobility being there present, a
Mask in the great banqueting house, the Gentlemen of the Middle Temple, and
other of Grayes Inn: a third besides three days Tylting, and running at the
Ring, the King himself in person with the young Prince that now is King,
besides many other pastimes, both stately and becoming the dignity of a King.

At this time there was a Proclamation against Verdingales, but to little
purpose, for they rather increased greater, then diminished; For where a thing
is once grown into a habit, it is hardly to be restrained.

There was another Proclamation, upon the former report of the coming of a Ship
of pocket Pistolls out of Spain, that no man should carry a Pistol in his
pocket, nor any that should be less then a foot long in the barrel. About
this time also the Papists were disarmed, and many strange rumors raised, which
things because they were uncertain, I omit to relate them, being rather
pertinent unto state, then unto profit.

Ambassadors sent into Russia, Swethia, and other Provinces ^or the renewing o^
frien^ship. Of the League in the Low Countries. The rumor of it.
MA^y outrages having been now of late committed by the Archduke upon the
States, diverse rumors are raised concerning the Leaguer, both strange and
almost universal: For there were parties, the Pope, the Emperor, the King of
Spain, and a Cardinal to ai^e the Archduke against the S^^tes. The
foundation of this combustion was laid upon the s^cking of a Protestant town
in Br^b^^t^ whereupon Grave Maurice drew out ten thousand into the Field, and
s^m^ ^ew blows happened, and suspected that it would have grown further, and
that th^re would have been a general opposition between Protestants and
Papist^, but by means of the Pope and the King, it was agreed, and went no
further, but left a scare to give a new occasion.

The war o^ Denmark was also brought unto a happy end, and the King r^tained
his right there; not long after the issue whereof, Embass^dors were sent into
Muscovie to renew the League of friendship with the Emperor, who now being
brought low by conti^u^ll wars, was glad to entertain such a motion.
Traffic is confirmed there with that Nation, and from thence the same
Embass^dors went to Swethi^, to conclude a Le^gue of friendship, the reason
whereof was thought to be for the ancient amity that had bee^e had heretofore
betwee^e the King of that Nation; from thence they went to the Duke of Cleeve,
and so to the Emperor with salutations.

The suit of the Cloth-workers; my Lord o^ Rochester stands for them; The
complaint of the Countess, she sues ^or a Divorce.
NOw this year the Cloth-workers (being covetous of larger employments)
petition the King and Counsel, that there might go no more white cloth out of
this Kingdom, but that they might be all dressed and dyed here before they
went over, and the reasons o^ their petition were three: First, that the
Hollander making use of dressing and dying our cloth almost doubled the value
they bought it ^or, whereby they were enriched, and we were impoverished. The
second reason, that whereas there was a multitude of poor in this Kingdom
that wanted employment, if they might have the dying and the dressing of those
clothes, it would find them work whereby they might be relieved, and there was
no reason why any other should make benefit of that which we might make good
of our selves. Lastly, whereas the Trade of dressing of cloth began to decay;
if now they might but have this, in process of time it might be restored, and
they might have as good skill to dress cloth, as the Dutchmen. My Lord of
Rochester, my Lord of Northampton, my Lord Tre^surer that now is, were great
agents in this business, and were thought to have been promised great sums
of money to accomplish it.


Now the Countess begin^ new complaints, and finds her Art to continue firm,
and that indeed there was such frigidity quoad hanc accomplishe^: That her
hu^b^nd, the good Earl of Essex, could not execute the office of a hu^band,
she up and tells her friends that she is still a maid, and that she had good
cause to complain, since that she having continued so long his wife, she in
that space had never the fruition of that pleasure that ought to be between
man and wife, for which cause she protested that she would never keep him
company any longer, and desired a Divorcement, because of his insufficiency.

This seemed strange unto the world, who took notice of the Earl to be of an
able body, and likely to have many children, and to undertake any exploit for
the good of the Commonwealth, indeed valuing this to be but an idle and vain
rumor that was spread (as often happened) to see how such a thing would be
liked in the world, and therefore let it pass with little notice.

In the mean time there is a motion between Rochester and her for a marriage,
and since it was so, that the world had taken notice of their business, now to
make some satisfaction, they would consummate a wedding between them: This
motion was well liked of on both parties, but the obstacle remained, her
husband was alive, and the Law would not permit her to have two husbands;
whereupon she grows the more eager of a divorce, that so she might have a
new hu^band, (for women of her disposition delight in change) and therefore
renewes her complaint, advice is taken in the business whether such a thing
may be had, there being no cause public of adultery or dislike of the
husband: Again, it was a question whether the wife might sue a divorce or not,
for that the Bill of divorcement was given to the husband, and not to the wife;
many such like objections being disputed to and again, at last it is concluded.

That in case the Earl was so unable, as she reported, to execute the office
of an husband, and that upon the search of twelve matrons, she appeared still
to be a maid: It was lawful that there might be a divorce, and the reason was
twofold, one that there might be a frigidity quoad hanc, another that
marriage was appointed for procreation sake, for which cause it was thought
lawful to sue a divorce.

Upon this they proceeded to the search, twelve Matrons were empannelled, the
day appointed, the search made, and the verdict returned, that she was a true
maid: who should bring this to the ears of the King, but my Lord of
Northampton, and so to the world, who grows jealous of fraud, doubting either
corruption or deceit, (for it was vulgarly reported) that she had a child long
before in my Lords absence; whereupon, some say this, some say that, and most
that the Countess was not searched; but that one of Sir Thomas Monsons
daughters was brought in to be searched in her place, and so both Jury and
Judges deceived. But how true this is, is not credible; yet nevertheless they
grant a bill of divorce, and now a separation being had between them, the
Earl in a great discontent leaves the Court, and repaired to his house in
Warwickshire, and there lives a private life.

The motion of Marriage goes forward. Overburies opinion concerning it; He
disswades Rochester from it: The breach between them; the principal cause of
it.
NOw might there be a Lawful discourse of marriage, since there was a lawful
divorce, had it nevertheless been kept private, and only some particular
friends made Privy on Rochesters side, Overbury, whose advice he requires
amongst others in this business, to what end it is unknown. Nevertheless,
Overbury was utterly against it, and being in serious discourse with him
concerning this subject, in the passage gallery at White Hall, entered into
these or the like words, as was reported.

First, how much he stood obliged to him for his countenance and favor, and
therefore would speak nothing but what was truth. Then how du^iful and ready he
was to perform all his commands, from whence he might easily perceive, that
what he spoke was out of affection. And lastly, that he had often endeavored
to avert his mind from these things, that both time and the envy of men might
turn his prejudice, taxing him that he had made all this to become hurtful
unto him, and converting the meaning of good intentions toward him, to his
disparagement and loss; notwithstanding the Viscount still pressed him on to
pass his opinion, protesting great kindness, and to do nothing without his
opinion; whereupon he lets him understand, that perceiving the common reports
of the multitude, and weighing them with the greatness of his person, that he
found it to be no less hurtful to his preferment, then helpful to subvert
and overthrow him. For who would (being possessed of so great possibility as he
was, so great honors and large reve^nues, and d^ily in expectation of others)
cast all away upon a wom^n, that is noted both for her in^ury and immodesty,
and pull upon him the hatred and contempt of great person^ges for so small a
mat^er; then he willed him to consider with himself the condition of the
person wher^of he sp^ke, the m^nner of her c^rriage from her yo^th, her present
conversation, the many ^nvies, dishonours and dislikes that were attendant upon
her; and besides, which is now the common report of the vulg^r (and he should
find them to be so many evils ^o attend her sub^ersion and overthrow.

It is not the nature of a wise man to make her his wife, whom he has made his
whore. Lastly, willed him to expect no better requital at her hands, then
which she had showed to her former hu^b^nd, and withal to weigh the present
condition that he was in, and to compare it with the future; now he h^d, as it
were, but an inclination unto such a thing, neith^r were those things made
evident, that after ages would lay open, nevertheless that he ^as taxed with
incivility, levity, and indeed effeminatenesse, that by the opinion of the
wise, he was adjudged altogether unworthy of that honor that was bestowed upon
him. But when these surmises should come by this his marri^ge to be m^de
evident, what evils before were but suspected, should then be enlarged, and
laid to his charge: Honor is not attended with volup^uousnesse, nor are the
ruins of a rotten branch to be cherished upon a new planted tree; but if that
he meant to be made famous, and to continue that with him, that now he freely
enjoyed; his opinion was, that he should utt^rly leave and forsake her
company, and to hold her, was both hurtful and hateful.

These speeches drew on others, and the Viscount being a little netled in his
affection, grows somewhat harsh. And Sir Thomas having been heretofore
excepted at with these kind of contentions, grows so much the more careless,
answers word for word, so that from fa^^^ and friendly speeches, they grew to
words of anger, and either to cross other. In conclusion, Overbury requires
his portion due unto him, and so wills Rochester to leave him to his own
fortunes, for that he could not endure these inordinate jangles which he had
accustomed toward him of late, and that if there had been any thing said,
that was either offensive to him, or to the disparagement of the Countess, it
was by his own procurement, and by reason of the good will and affection that
he bore to him: with these and many such words they parted.

Rochester and the Countess meet; They conclude the death of Overbury; That
Northampton had a hand in it; causes why.
THe Countess having ere this borne a deadly hate toward Overbury, because he
had oftentimes before diswaded the Viscount to abstain from her company; yet
now having disclosed unto her this speech, she becomes much more revengefull,
especially because he had taxed her with the name of a Whore; for truth is
hateful to the evil, and what before she concealed, now breaks forth with
fury. For concealing anger is much worse then open violence, persuading
Rochester that it was not possible that ever she should endure these injuries,
or hope for any prosperity as long he lived; he being the only man that
withstood his purposes, with many other persuasions, that he only of all men
began to grow eminent, and who was the man so likely to step up after him as
Overbury: Insomuch as these persuasions, together with his own conceived
evil, procures the Viscount to give a liking to her determination, and to put
his hand into the fire, where he needed not, making himself accessory to that
which he had no occasion to put in practice at all.

There were some that charged Northampton to have had a hand in these
businesses, and to have uttered these and the like words, That he wondered how
the Viscount could be so much affected to this man Overbury, that without him
he could do nothing, (as it were) making him his right hand, seeing he being
newly grown into the Kings favor, and wholly depending upon his greatness,
must expect to come to ruin, when that man rose to preferment: Also he
condemned Overbu^y for his boldness and peremptory sauciness, that checked and
corrected the Viscount for the love that past betwixt the Viscount and him, and
opposed many of his designs and purposes; whereupon he concluded, that unless
he did either curb his greatness, or abate his pride, he in time would be
equ^ll with him both in po^er and greatness: whether this proceeded out of
fear^ of himself, or envy toward Overbury, or to collogue with his Niece and
Roches^er, or to prevent the plagues of Sr Tho: who al^ogether distasted these
nigling courses: It cannot be conceived but these are the last words that he
spoke of this subject. That for his own part he knew himself clear in all
offenses against the State, and their family was so eminent in the
Commonwealth, that he could not hurt him. But for Rochester, being made privy
to all his designs, growing peremptory, and no whit tractable to his
disposition; besides likely to come to eminency and honor in the
Commonwealth, he finds it both necess^ry and fitting ^or his safety, that he
should be a means to dispatch him: whereupon the Viscount being led by the
nose, as he thought for the best, gives consent, and endeavors to put in
practice what they have determined; Now of all hands they cast about how this
might be effected and pass unregarded, so that they might sustain no loss or
disparagement by the attempt.

Sir William Wade removed from the Lieutenancie of the Tower, Sir Jarvice
Yeluis preferred.
For this purpose alone it was thought that a quarrel was picked by Sir
William Wade, who was now Lieutenant of the Tower, and had continued a great
while, but there were other causes objected. And first he was thought too
severe against the Lady Arabella, and gave some other Prisoners too much
liberty: Another was, that ^e being now grown rich, began to grow careless
and neglected his office; But the very truth of the business was thought to be
this, Sir Iervace Yeluis being a Lincolnshire gentleman, having been brought
up a public life from his youth, trained in the study of the public Laws
at Lincolns Inn, and ambitious of preferment, offered a sum of money for
that honor and place; For howsoever Sir William Wade might be one way taxed
for his too much desire of wealth, which thing might be tolerable in him,
being pressed with a great charge; yet he was wise, honest, and discreet in his
place, and discharged it with much more sufficiency then he that succeeded
him: but according to the saying of the Poet. Quisquis ha^et nummos secura
navigat aura,
Fortunaque suo temporet arbitrio,
These men that store of money have
With prosperous wind shall sail,
And fortune plays unto their wish,
To speed they cannot fail.


By this means he is got into the Lieutenancie, and for this cause Sir William
Wade is put out. Things ordered after this sort never proceed without envy,
unless the persons that enjoy such places be very considerate, it is likely
they will have a sudden fall; but what care men of power for such things? he
being established in his office must recollect his money paid by using some
kind of extortion, and to bear out this, be observant to such as preferred
him, and so by their countenance, he might use the greater liberty: For this
cause he made the Earl of Northampton and Rochester the whole end of his
actions, fearing more to displeas^ them then the King; A fit man for their
purpose.

The Countess repaires to Mistress Turner to enquire a man out for her; makes
complaint of Overburies insolency, discloses her determin^tions; Weston is
nominated.
IN the mean time the Countess thought it not enough to hear, nor to fret
and fume, nor persuade and entreat my Lord to undertake this dangerous
enterprise; but to Mistress Turner she must go, and there renew her complaints
with tears, (hardly found in a woman of her disposition) protesting she was
never so defamed, neither did she ever think, that any man durst to be so
saucie, as to call her whore and base woman, and that to Rochester her only
hopes, and with an impudent face; But Overbury that Negro, that scumme of men,
that Devil incarnate, he might do any thing, and pass either unregarded or
unpunished: This moves pity in this pitiful woman Mistress Turner, who frets as
fast to see her fret, so that there is storming between them, as is
incredible. At length, as we see two clouds after long strife in the air,
which shall have the priority in place, join in one; so these two women, after
they had fulfilled their frantic humor join in this, to be the death of him;
that must be the end, (there is no malice to the malice of a woman) no
submission, no entreaty, no persuasion could prevail, but he must dye, Mistress
Turner soothes her with ( I that she ^ould) and it is pity he should live to
defame so honorable a Lady, so well descended, to the utter disparagement of
her house, and that rather then he should pass with life, she would be his
deaths-man her self; words of course in such cases, where people are carried
away with heady malice, not with reason: Yet for all this, coming to their
right senses, they begin to weigh the matter, and that it was no small thing to
kill a man, both in respect of conscience and law. Therefore they cast about
which should be the best way to do it; at las^ they conclude, that to poison
him was the only way, and that with le^^t suspect. But then the party that
should do it was to seek; for he must be no ordinary man, some Apothecarie or
Physician that might temper the poison rightly to take effect, according to
t^eir mind, and of long study: one Weston was named, that had sometime been
servant to Doctor Turner, and thereby learned such experience, that none was so
fitting to accomplish this exploit to him. This man now in the country must be
sent for, Mistress Turner must work upon him to bring him to this exploit; for
things of this nature must be carried with wisdom and discretion, for who will
hazard his life for (had I wist.) Two hundred pounds is proffered him, and he
of all men undertakes it.

Overburies great favor. The motion of the Council to send him Ambassador to
the Archduke. He contemplates of it. Is persuaded by my Lord Viscount to
refuse it.
THese things notwithstanding Overbury still grows into favor, and the
Council still finding his diligence and sufficiency in his place, nominates
him as a man fit to be sent Ambassador into the Low Countries to the
Archduke, making that a means to draw him up to great preferments. This comes
to Overburies ear, who knowing my Lord of Northampton to be his utter enemy,
and growing jealous of Rochester, begins to contemplate what the meaning of
this might be; thus between hope and fear, he stands at a maze: To refuse
would be to his great disgrace; to undertake it would be to the loss of his
preferment: standing in these doubts, the Viscount after thus many jangles
comes to him and salutes him, and after many discourses, falls into speech of
the intention of the Council concerning this Embassage, not so much to assist
and encourage him to it, as to see how he stood affected; whereupon, finding
him hammering upon his determinations, not being certainly determined to any
thing, joins with him, and utterly diswades him from undertaking it: For
(quoth he) your preferments and your expectations lies not among foreign
nations; you are now in cre^it at home, and have already made trial of the
dangers of travail, why then should you hazard all upon uncertainties, being
in possession (as a man might say) of all that you may expect by by this means
already? These speeches, what with the trust he put in the Viscount, what with
the doubtfulnesse of his mind, does in a manner confirm his opinion rather to
leave it, then to take it. But nevertheless gives to understand, that it was
no small thing to oppose the determination of the Council, and to contradict
the Kings employment; for in either of these he must expect the displeasure of
both, and be in danger to receive condign punishment.

But Rochester, to get these doubts out of his mind, with great protestation
and long discourses, let him understand he had so much experience of his worth,
and found him so faithful and diligent in employments, that he could so well
miss his right hand as miss him, an^ that in case any such danger should
happen to him; yet nevertheless, if either his word, his letter, credit, or
favor, could either mitigate, release, or relieve him, it should not be
wanting to do him ease and pleasure.

Being led on with these hopes, he is in a manner drawn utterly to deny that
which was intended for his profit, and to give him a fit opportunity to excuse
their malice toward him, as after happened according to the saying of the
Poet. Ne quic quam creed, haud credere quic quam
-- nam f^onte polito
Astutum rappido torrent sub pectore vulpem.
Believe not thou scarce any man;
For often a Phrygian face,
Is smoothly covered with a smile,
But within seeks thy disgrace.


The Viscount seeing him at this time in so fitting a vain to be wrought upon,
and so easily to be persuaded from his purpose, showed him much more favor
then heretofore he had done, the better to confirm credence in him toward his
persuasions, and to encourage him in his determinations, and by this means he
is utterl^ deceived, and grows confident to ^orsake it; in this mind the
Viscount leaves him, and betakes himself to his purpose.

The Countess, Earl, and Viscount meet. They determine of the matter. The
King is incensed against Overbury.
SIr Iervace being now grown old in his office, and being acquainted with it;
amongst other things is sounded whether he stands faith^ull to his Pat^ons,
Northampton and Roches^er, whereby it is found, that he would be plyant to any
thing they would desire; but yet not made acquainted with this determination,
nevertheless it feeds them with hope to execute their purposes with better
prosperity: For the Lieutenant being their friend, and Weston (a man that had
gotten the art of poisoning) entertained for the purpose, and with a resolute
mind ready to effect it, made them neither suspect nor doubt any thing, only
how they might get him to the Tower. For this purpose it is thought fit, that
Roches^er having the Kings ear, should be a means to possess the King with
some misdemeanors that he had committed, that thereby the King being incenst
against him, and the refusal of the Embassage, making evident the truth of
these complaints, that they need not doubt of any such matter; whereupon my
Lord of Rochester amongst other things (as at time convenient) lets the King
understand how insolent Overbury was grown, that he not only contemned him,
but His Majesty also, estimating this employment to be sent Ambassador either
too light a preferment for his deserts, or else intended to procure him further
evil, and that he utterly dislik't it, and determined to refuse it.

The King being possessed of these things, and by him, (who to the judgment of
the world was his greatest friend) took displeasure at it, so that by his
countenance, one might have perceived his anger; For the frowning of a King is
like the roaring of a Lion, terrible to the spectators and hearers, so that now
they doubted not of their expectations to get him into the Tower, where being a
Prisoner in the Kings disgrace, under the protection of one who more esteemed
their favor then the Kings displeasure, sequestered from his friends, no
intercourse suffered to come unto him, but what came from the Countess,
Northampton, Rochester and Weston, a fit agent to execute all manner of evils;
why, to the judgment of the world, it is impossible that ever this evil should
come to light. And thus being ranked up in their own conceits, they run
headlong to their own destruction: for when there were but two persons privy
to the act of murder, as in Cain and Abell, it could not pass unpunished, but
that Cain must be marked with a perpetual mark of ignomie; how much less
shall this go undiscovered, when there are so many privy to it? Thus may we
see that one sin another does provoke,
And that murder is as near to lust as flame to smoke.


Sir Thomas refuses the Embassage; Incurres the Kings displeasure; He is sent
to the Tower. Westom is preferred to him. Gresham dies. Fra^cklin entertained
into the business. A new speech of Marriage between the Countess and
Rochester.
SIr Thomas Overbury and Rochester, having (for some private occasion fallen
into a new breach at Newmarket, returns very pensively to London; and now the
time being come that he should give an answer, what he would do concerning
this Embassage, he answered, That he acknowledged himself much bound unto His
Majesty for many favors that he had bestowed upon him, as to prefer him to
so great honor; but yet nevertheless knowing himself of such a place
(unexperienced) how to execute it, and besides tied to many domestic
businesses, desired to be excused; This seeming something strange and harsh,
that he should neglect his own good, and by this means incur the
displeasure of the King, and lose his expectations, makes some of his friends
to wonder, others to stand in a maze.

But in the conclusion, as he had justly deserved, by reason of his contempt,
he is committed to the Tower, but not to be kept as a close Prisoner; but
after, my Lord of Northampton and Rochester being both of the Privy Council,
and in great favor at Court, sends unto the Lieutenant that he should keep him
close Prisoner, and afterward received by word of mouth from Sir Thomas
Monson, that he should not suffer any Letters, tokens or other things to be
delivered unto him.

Their expectation in this thing being accomplished, Mis Turner by the
instigation of the Countess, becomes a great suitor to Sir Thomas Monson, to
have his Letter to prefer Weston unto Sir Thomas to wait on him in the
Tower, who hearing the name of the Countess; and withal, understanding the
great affection that was between her and Rochester, condescended, wrote, and
sent him with the Letter to Sir Iervace in the Tower; He showed it to Sir
Thomas, willing to deserve his petitions chiefest favor, with the more
readiness entertained him: As when a man ignorantly treads upon a Serpent, is
stung for his labor; So Sir Thomas harbors in his own breast the author of
his own destruction.

Now Gresham growing into years, having spent much time, and many foul
prayers to accomplish these things; at this time gathers all his bables, viz.
pictures in lead, in wax, in plates of gold, of naked men and women, with
crosses, crucifixes, and other implements, wrapping them all up together in a
scarf, crossed every letter in the sacred word, Trinity crossed A: W: O:
crossed: these being very holily delivered into the hands of one Weston to be
hid in the earth, that no man might find them, and so in Thames street having
finished his evil times, he dyed, leaving behind him a man and a maid, the one
hanged for a Witch, the other for a Thief.

After his death with much writing many entreaties and rewards, one Francklin
was entertained into these actions, a man of a reasonable stature, crook
shouldred, of a swarthy complexion, and thought to be no less a Witch then the
two former, Gresham and Forman; This man was more employed to make poisons fit
to be administered by Weston then otherwise; for he was excellent in that art,
to mitigate or increase their strength, so that sometimes a poison should be a
month ere it should work: Verily evil actions shall never want evil actors;
and in all ages, Physicians, Apothecaries, Druggists, ^ashired Serving-men that
have fallen into want, have still been the agents in such enterprises.
Tiberius his Physician, Spado an Apothecarie, and Ligdo, Drusius Servant, are
made agents to be his Poysoners. Neroes Bondman must kill him, Pisoes Captain
under Germanicus must poison him; and by the help of a woman, poysoner of
Cow, a town in Gretia, who was so skillful, that she had poison in his
poison, in his hair to kill himself; a Centurian to Maximus must poison him,
Alexanders Physician Antipater, and Aristotle must be the author of his own
death. And here Francklin a kind of Physician, Weston a Servant to Sir Thomas,
and Sir Iervace Yeluis, who is, as hereafter you shall hear, Privado to the
Earl and Viscount, and the Countess and Mistress Turner are made instruments
to kill and dispatch Sir Thomas Overbury: so that it has been almost in all
ages, and in all such outrages sound, that either such persons or women have
been actors in such attempts.

Over^ury being thus confined into the Tower, and accounted amongst them as a
Friar, a dead person in the Law, in whose breast many secrets were contained,
being still fed on with hope of preferment and liberty, lest he should disclose
what he knew. They at their will and pleasure carrouse full healths of sin and
abomination, and freely discourse of a marriage to be consummated between the
Countess and Rochester, that so being tied in this bond of matrimony, and
joined in affinity with my Lord of Northampton, more trust might be had in him,
and better use might be made of his Honor and greatness.

Now there is none to support him, no man to dissuade him, his looseness with
the Countess gauls his conscience, and that it might be the more offensive to
him, and make him the willinger to consent unto this motion, he is still pressed
with it, and that it is both unfit and unseemely, whereas on the otherside, if
they marry, it will be both lawful, honorable, and commendable, and the ears
of the vulgar will be then stopped, and none dares be so bold as to touch it;
This carries show of truth, so that what with his former affection, what with
his present offense that he conceives at these courses, concludes the marriage:
Times are appointed to confer, how impediments might be avoided, and what
should be fitting to be dome in this behalf.

How the Lieutenant came acquainted with the business; Encouraged to persist
by Northampton. Rewards promised him. Be examined Sir Thomas to find out his
affection: Most think of Religion: Some think toward the Countess.
IT is now high time to enter into this action, and the Countess means to be
the first, and for this purpose, she went and got a glass of blew water some
two inches long, this being wrapped in a paper, she delivers to Westons son
with instructions, that he should go to the Tower and deliver it to his father;
he does so, who having his matter aforehand put into his head, at supper time
takes the same in one hand, and part of Sir Thomas Overburies supper in the
other hand, and who should he meet withal, but Sir Iarvace Yeluis the
Lieutenant? So he demanded of him with a kind of caution, whether he should
give it him now, the Lieutenant stopped, and asked him what? to which Weston
answered, Sir, you know what is to be done: This made him stand in a maze, and
doubt the worst, whereupon he calls Weston into examination, and makes him
confess all his intention, from what grounds, and of whom he received it, and
partly the cause of it; he now being made a slave unto greatness, and having
laid out much money to purchase his place, for fear to lose the one, and to
offend the other, lets Weston go with this caution to omit it for that time,
whereas a wise man, rather then he would have run himself headlong into
perdition, would have discovered, and have made them a means, to have
manifested his faithfulness in his office.

But what shall we say to a man lost? The next day he is sent for to the Lord
of Northampton: These after many long and large discourses, at length the Earl
discloses to him his intention concerning Overbury, and with those things
mingles many of his insolences: First of his obstinacy against the Viscount,
his insolency against the Countess, his opposition almost against all good
men, and that for the causes of such a thing happened, there being none to look
after him, it would pass unregarded, or unrespected, but withal gives him
many cautions, how he should manage himself in the business, letting him
understand what manner of man he was; a Scholar, and one that had an excellent
tongue, and wit; a Traveller, experienced in the course of the world, and
besides that favored the contrary Faction, and as great a Politician as any
was this day in England; therefore in regard he ought to be the more wary, both
who came to him, and who went from him, and above all, that no Letters pass to
and fro: These and many other such like speeches having past between them,
(for the Earl was two hours, by his own confes^ion, prompted him with
cautions and considerations, that he might be the readier to act his part in
this adventure he was to deal in.) Lastly, he concludes, that above all he
should insinuate with him, to see how he stood affected to these proceedings,
and what words he uttered from a heart full of thirst with grief and sorrow,
must either speak or burst, and his service and diligence herein shall be
rewarded with a thousand pounds.

Whether it was the greediness of the reward, or the foolish desire he had to
give content to the Earl and Viscount, they being his only Favorers, or some
other hope still unknown, but he by this means is brought to his own
destruction, and so gives consent to conceal that which was intended. At his
coming back, he repaires to Sir Thomas Overbury, under pretense to comfort him
in his sorrow, and advises him to be more lightsome, and not to consume
himself with grief; by this means entering into further discourse, secretly
insinuates into his intentions; Sir Thomas having a good opinion of him, and
supposing all was done out of faith and honesty toward him, having by this
means learned what he could of him, writes unto the Lord of Northampton a
Letter to this effect: MY especial good Lord, having undertook my Prisoner,
according to your instructions, after long silence, as standing between hope
and fear, he takes his Bible, and after he had read upon it, and by it
protested his innocence; after upon further conference concerning the
Countess, he said that he had justified her already, and that he could do no
more then what he had done. But for himself, alas (quoth he) what will they
do with me? I answered, so reason you, as you shall make no question
hereafter of your pureness, and I left him in some sense to work upon him. As
I was going, he concluded, that in the generality, she was so worthy, that
she might be a wife in particular ^or my Lord of Rochester, he would not say
it, lest my Lord should condemn him, for weighing his worth.

At my next coming to him, I found him not in sense, but fury, He let fly at
you, but was respective to my Lord of Rochester, whose part he takes
altogether. I see the event, I desire it may be safely covered; what my service
may do you in this, or any thing else, I will be faithful to your Lordship,
and so I rest,

Jervace Yeluis.




These and many other things being inserted into this Letter was sent unto the
Earl, which he read, and in reading laughs and smiles at the simplicity of the
one, and ignorance of the other, nevertheless, in outward appearance he
applauds all the actions of Sir Iervace, but especially to my Lord of
Rochester, holding him both a discreet and wise man, and that his secrecy, and
honest dealing in this employment, deserves everlasting praises with after ages.

More Poisons are sent from the Countess. Sir Thomas Monson is suspected to
have a hand in the business. Overbury grows sickly; Jealous of his diet; No
access is suffered to him.
WEston having received 24l. of his allowance, and yet nevertheless nothing
accomplished according to the Countess her expectation, is checked by Mistress
Turner for delaying it; whereupon he gets into his hands certain Poisons, viz.
Rosacre, white Arsnick, Mercury sublimate, Cantarides, red Mercury, with three
or four more several poisons, tempering them with his broth and his mea^,
according as he saw them affected, increasing and diminishing their strength as
he was instructed by his ancient friend Master Franklin, besides these, Tarts
and Jellies are sent by the Viscount and Countess to Sir Thomas Monson, as
from thence by the hands of one Simon, master servant unto Sir Tho: to be
delivered to Weston, and so to Overbury, every of which Tarts and Jellies were
poisoned with a several poison.

These courses caused Sir Thomas Monson to be suspected of this act, and to
have a hand in it: First, in respect he preferred Weston to his service:
Secondly, poisoned Tarts and Jellies went out of his house: And lastly, for
that he did not discover these things, his men only having access to the
Tower, and that to speak with Weston. Now his salt, his meat, his drink, and
whatsoever he eats is mingled with poison, and for the increase of his
torment, is increased or diminished, as the saw Sir Thomas Overbury affected.

By this means he begins to grow extreme sickly, having been hereto^ore
accustomed to very good health; insomuch that he can s^arce stand or go, what
with the pain of his body, and the heat: yet nevertheless being a strong man,
he stood it out a long time, till at length he begun to grow jealous of his man
Weston, for his malady increased or diminished, as he affected, but yet some
Physic he desired, and at his special instance and request, and not without
some gratitude as was thought, one Paul de la Bell an Apothecarie, by the
advice of Doctor Marvin, brought a Bath to cool his body, with advice to be
sparing of his diet, for that he suspected that his meat was not wholesome:
Surely this did him much good, and preserved his life longer then they
expected, insomuch that they misdoubt some fallacy or fraud; and therefore send
new Letters to the Lieutenant to have a special care that none may be suffered
to see him or speak with him: for evil men are full of needless fears, and
now there is such special watch had over him, that none of his men might be
permitted so much liberty as to speak with him out at a Window; and the reason
being asked, Answer was made, that the Lieutenant had commandment from the
Council that it should be so.

Thus the good gentleman passed away his tedious and sorrowful days with many
discontents, being filled with pains and grief, without friends and
comforters, ready to be vexed and tormented upon every occasion, and consuming
and languishing away without any common society that was allowed to the meanest
Prisoner in the house; In this man may we see the misery of such as fall into
the hands of Popish Catholics, for by Northamptons means was this
strictness showed toward him; here will we leave him languishing in sorrow,
and lamenting his misfortune.

The Marriage between the Viscount and the Countess published; questioned
whether it might be lawful. A nullity obtained to make it lawful. My Lord of
Essex repayes the Portion. The Viscount made Earl of Somerset.
TIme can no longer conceal these secret meetings, but they must at length
come to light: The Marriage between the Viscount and the Countess is
published, this is strange to the world, and so much the more strange, by how
much three such great and eminent persons, as the Earl of Essex, the
Countess, and the Viscount were interessed in it: And now, according to the
common course, every one speaks as he stands affected; some boldly, some
sparingly, some call her a loose woman, and pities the good Earl of Essex, and
say that he had sustained more wrong then ever any English Peer had done.

First, to suffer disgrace by the Prince, now by his wife, others blame her
with words harsh and unseemly, a third sort Rochester; and that it is pity, but
that she should prove as bad a wife to him, as ever she was to the Earl of
Essex: then if Overbury had been at liberty this had never happened. Others
that were more stayed and judicious in their opinion, foresaw the ruin and
downfall of Rochester by this means, but none durst speak of it. For who will
put his finger into the fire, unless he be compelled; nevertheless to stop
the mouths of the vulgar, this Marriage is called into question, whether it
may be lawful or not, because her Husband was then living: For this cause the
Bishops of this Land were divided. By the opinion of some she might, by the
opinion of others she might not; my Lord of Canterbury, London, and many others
were ut^erly against it; But Winchester and Ely stood stiffely it might,
provided a Nullitie might be had: for by that means the former Marriage should
be utterly determined.

A Nullity was obtained, and upon the grant of that, it was ordered that my
Lord of Essex should repay her Portion that he received with her at his
marriage, that so to the show of the world it might be said, there had been no
marriage between them. This afterward was called into question, and thought a
mere trick of Northampton to discharge some of the greatest of the Clergy,
and to discountenance our Religion, it left a foul scarre, and gave a foul
occasion to the Adversary to speak broadly where they had liberty, and of some
even in our Kingdom.

This Order being sent to my Lord of Essex, he forthwith prep^res for the
repayment of five thousand pound, for so much he had received with her; and
for this purpose he sold and fell diverse woods at Adderston, and near
thereabouts: His Grandmother the Countess of Leicester helped him much, or else
he should have been constrained to sell much land to have paid it; verily a
hard course, having sustained so many injuries.

The King nevertheless continues his favor toward Rochester, and that he
might be as eminent as the best, he is installed Earl of Somerset. Thus
favors are heapt upon him, though he little deserved them. And the Countess
what she desires, is still to be a Countess, but called after another name,
that is, Countess of Somerset; many are the chances that happen in the world,
some good, some bad, and those things we least suspect, do soonest happen to
divert us.

At this time my Lord of Somerset little thought to have been laid in the
Tower, and made heir of Overburies bedchamber, but by this we may see, that
all things are in the hands of God.

The Marriage comes to Overburies Ears. He prophesies his own death. He
falls into a relapse. He writes to the Earl to remember his promise. Answer
is sent him with white Mercury, instead of a medicinable Powder. His death. The
state of his body after his death. The Rumor that is spread of him. The
Authors Lamentation.
NOw although Sir Thomas Overbury was kept private, and that no man might have
access to him; yet the news of this Marriage comes to his ears, and
presently upon hearing of it he tells the messenger, that he had almost as
good have said to morrow he should die, for he was sure now not to live long;
and thereupon falls into great lamentations, as well in regard of the Earl of
Somerset, that he had so cast away his Fortunes, as of himself, for that now
he more suspected his life, then ever heretofore. Whereupon he falls into a
Relapse, and his malady increased every day more and more upon him, whether
weakened with grief, or for want of liberty, or through abstinencie; it is
not unknown that the poison had more power over him, then ever heretofore, in
so much that he could scarce contain himself by reason of his extreme
languishing away, as a man in a consumption: But with much more extremity; so
that now being in this extremity, he thinks it high time to put Somerset in
mind of his promise. And for this purpose he writes a Letter to this effect.

RIght Noble and worthy Sir,
the ^ormer accustomed favors, and absolute promise concerning my present
delivery, has caused me at this time by these lines to solicit your
Lordship, and to put you in remembrance if the same, not doubting that your
Honor is at all forgetful of me, but only (by reason of my imprisonment)
being possessed of a dangerous disease, would for my bodies safety partake of the
felicity of the open air; In which case, if your Lordship please to
commiserate my present necessities, and procure me my speedy delivery, I shall
not only stand so much the more obliged, but also acknowledge you ^he defender
and preserver of my life.


These lines (being subscribed) were sent to Somerset, and delivered into his
own hands, the messenger returns answer, that presently he could not
accomplish what he required, but willed him not to doubt, for shortly he should
hear of his deliverance. Thus being fed with hopes, he ^akes new comfort to
him, in the meantime Weston repaires to Mistress Turner for more of his pay,
being in want, answer was made, that as soon as he had ended his employment,
he should not fail to receive it, but before then he must not expect any
thing, whereupon he returns, and enters into new designs, for in all this
time, that is, from the one and twentieth of April, until the beginning of
September following, in the year 1613. Sir Thomas had held out: while he was
thus pusling himself to bring this to perfection, Somerset sent him a Letter
to this effect.

THat as yet the Court was busy about important business, and the Kings ear
was not at leisure to entertain any motion, but as soon as he could find
opportunity he would not fail to speak in his behalf. In the mean time to
ease the pain of his malady, he had sent him a sovereign Powder, either to be
eaten, or drunk, which Powder was rank poison. This feeds him still with
hope, but brings him small comfort.


Now Weston had found out an unknown Apothecary, and with him concludes for
twenty pounds to administer a Glister, wherein should be put Mercury sublimate,
the youth was to come to die it, Weston prepares it, persuades Sir Thomas that
it will be much for his health; whereupon about the fourteenth day of
September, he brings the said Apothecary to execute his office, assists him
therein, and by the infusion thereof, he falls into a languishing disease with
a pain in his guts, the next day ofter with extremity of pain he gave up the
ghost.

After his death, Weston receives the rest of his pay, and dispatches the
unknown Apothecarie into France; After, it was given out, that Sir Thomas
lived a base loose life in the Tower, and not according to that strictness as
became a Prisoner, but being suffered to have too much liberty, he run into
excess of lasciviousness, so that thereby he got the Pox, and thereof dyed.
This went for current amongst some; amongst others that were ignorant some
little respect had to it. But to others that sought narrower into the matter,
they found it far otherwise; for De la Bell the Apothecarie (before spoken
of) having relation to him a little before his death, repor^ed he was changed
in his complexion, his body consumed away, and full of yellow blisters, (uglie
to look upon,) and it appeared by a Letter my Lord of Northampton wrote unto
Rocheste^, to pick a thank; That there was found in his arm ablister, and upon
his belly twelve kirnells raised, not like to break, each as broad as three
pence, and as big as a small button, one issue upon his back, whereupon was a
plaster from his shoulders downward, of a dark tawnie color, strange and
uglie to behold; he stunck so intollerably, as was not to be borne withal,
glad to be thrown into a loose sheer into his coffin, buried without knowledge
or privitie of his friends upon the Tower hill; at lasts he conclude^, that God
is gracious in cutting off ill instruments before their time.

Some of the factious crew had a purpose, if he had got out, to have made some
use of him, from whence may be gathered, how that Northampton held Protestans
factious, and suspected Sir Thomas to have further knowledge of his secrets,
then he would have had him, which was the cause, as was thought, besides the
former evils that hastened his end, and caused him to be taxed with so great
infamy, as to dye of the Pox. This passes current, and the mischefe lies
concealed, who dare to speak of it, two such great men having their hands in
it?

Thus may we see that good and bad men come to miserable ends, and oftentimes
those that are virtuous do soonest suffer disgrace and contempt. This man
before he came to Court, was brought up in all Gentlemanlike qualities: in his
youth at Cambridge, after in the Middle Temple, there instructed in those
qualities became a gentleman, by the entreaty of my Lord Treasurer Sir Robert
Cecill, preferred to Court, found favor extraordinary, yet hindered of his
expectation by some of his enemies, and to shift off discontents, forced to
travel, and therein spent not his time, as most do to loss; but furnished
himself with things fitting a Statesman, by experience in foreign
governments, knowledge of the language, passages of employment, external
courtship, and good behavior, things not common to every man: notwithstanding
such are the imperfections of our times, he is brought into ignomie and
contempt, and all those good qualities obscured, by the disgraceful reproaches
of a dissolute woman: What shall we then say, since that both vice and virtue
do both end in misery? he is most happy that lives most private, for
according to the saying of the Poet, Vitam, animas, operam, sumptus, impendimus
aula,
Praemia, pro meritis, quae retributa putas?
Aula dedit nobis rescripta votata papiro,
Et sine mente sonos, and sine cord manus.
Paucos beavit, Aula plnres perdidit,
Sed and hoc quoque ipsos, quos beavit pendebit.
Our lusts, our souls, our wealth we spend
In Court to purchase praise,
But what reward is in the end
For our deserts repaie?
Their vows and protestations deep,
Not pressed in paper but in mind;
Their sounds of words to lulls asleep,
From body forced, not from the mind;
Hands there we join, but not our hearts,
Whereby it happens few are blessed,
And many thousand that resort
Unto the Court, by it are lost.
And of those few that blessed are,
We often see there fall again;
Their blessed days they spend in care,
And after end their lives in pain.


The complaint for want of treasure; The King sets many Lands to Fe^ Farm.
That death of the Lord Harrington: The death of his son.
GReat sums of money being disbursed upon her Graces Wedding, and daily
employments for others^ some for Ireland; The Lord Treasurer wanting there to
defray ordinary expenses, some for the Kings own use, and some for other
occasions, causes a great complaint for want of treasure: Officers at Court go
unpaid, and many of the Kings Servants receive not their wages at set times, so
that the King is forced to set many of his Lands to Fee Farm, and the four
Deputy Treasurers, with some few other, have the passing of them; now my Lord
Harrington obtained a Patent for the making of brass Farthings, a thing that
brought with it some contempt, though lawful; for all things lawful are not
expedient: who being enjoined to go into the Low Countries with her Grace, by
the way lost his life. His son succeeded both in honor and Patent, and
enjoyed them not long before he dyed: within short time after the hopefullest
gentleman of that name, more fit for employments, then for a private life; and
for a Statesman, then for a Soldier: he had been at Cambridge, there reputed
for a great Scholar; he traveled into Italy, Venice, and France; he employed
his time for the most part in study, whereby he made himself apt for great
matters. But yet it pleased God even then when he was in his greatest hope to
cut off his days: He gave all that he had to the Countess of Bedford his
Sister, defeating her neither of the land, nor the right of the Barony,
esteeming her to be worthy of much more then he had to leave. He made a worthy
and godly end: These things coming so thick one after another, left no time for
men to dream of Overburies death.

The Earl of Somerset his conscience accuses him; Northamptons speech to him:
He becomes a newter in Religion. The Earl of Northamptons course.
A Nullitie being thus purchased, he dignified (as is said) and the ma^ch
concluded about Candlemas, 1614. they Marry with much joy and solemnity; a
Mask being performed at Somerset's charge, and many rumors pass without any
respect; all these things nothwithstanding, a guilty conscience can never go
without accusation; pensiveness and fullness do possess the Earl, his
wonted mirth forsakes him, his countenance is cast down, he takes not that
felicity in company as he was wont to do, but still something troubles him:
Verily it is a dangerous thing to fall within the compass of a guilty
conscience, it eats and consumes the soul of a man as rust does Iron, or as
beating waves hallowes the Rocks; and though these things are not made
public, yet nevertheless Northampton observed it in him, having so admirable
capacity, he could make use of all things; wherefore knowing his disease, viz.
his mind feared with murder, and knowing the Earl tractable (as he desired)
enters into more familiar discourse with him: For when the mind of a young man
is corrupted with evil, he runs headlong into sin without stay or fear;
wherefore amongst many other discourses, this falls between them. That in case
the death of Sir Thomas Overbury should come to light, they were then in a most
dangerous state. And the next thing they must expect is loss of life, goods,
lands, honors, their names to be made scandalous to the world, and to
conclude, to be branded with an ignominious death. Neither that there was any
way left for to escape this, but either by making their own fortunes so great,
that he might oppose all accusations, or else being Catholics, to endeavor
that in defending them, they again might assist their cause in case that any
matter came against them; this carrying some show and likelihood of truth. And
that indeed his case was desperate, if ever it should come to light, concludes
to combine with No^h^^pton in wh^tsoever he should undertake, and in the
conclusion became a ^e^ter in Religion; whereupon, to the intent he might set
further evils on foot, besides those before remembered, he begins to rip up the
ancient quarrel between the Welsh and the English, who now murmur at some
discontents; and to the intent to hearten on the Irish, sends Letters thither
by the hands of one Ha^mon a poor man, unto such whom ^e knows to be
faithful in the Romish Religion, and thereby confirms them in their opinion,
assuring them that God will still provide one or more to protect his Church,
and that now the greatest Favorite in England would stand for them: upon which
Letter the Irish grew obstinate, as I have said, and altogether neglect the
service of God, and utterly deny the Oath of Supremacy, protesting loss of
life and goods, rather then to be enforced to so damnable a thing.

Now we see there the Church utterly forsaken, none to hear divine Service.
The discipline of their own Church established, and the Irish in general
expecting a day to have their liberty and freedom in Religion. The same man
returning this news, is after sent into Yorkshire with a black staff and a
knob upon the end, within which knob, Letters are conveyed from place to place
as well for pointing Assemblies as meetings for Mass, and entertaining of
Priests; now might a man go to Mass in diverse places of the City, and who
were so publicly favored as Priests? Their number increase, their Priests
are entertained, Confession in many places publicly practiced, and although
it was contrary to the Law, yet greatness overcountenancing them, it was
little regarded. In the mean time quarrels went forward between the Scottish
and English, continual complaints, and the suit of the Cloth-workers, with
hope of obtaining their request, not so much because of the profit, as to raise
up a discontent between the Duchy and them. These courses caused diverse men
to pass diverse opinions, and many men to pass their opinion as they affected
either parties.

The rumors of the Spanish Fleet. A Proclamation against Spanish money. A
Leaguer in the Low Countries. The public rumors against my Lord of
Northampton. He exhibits a bill in the Starchamber against the publishers. They
justified by my Lord of Canterburie's speech. The death of my Lord of
Northampton; his Funeral; his Will. The names of those that succeeded him in
his Offices.
NOt long after it was rumoured abroad, that the Spaniard had drawn out a
Navy of Ships of an hundred Sail, but to what purpose no man knew; many
suspected for England, because they were come so far upon those Coasts;
others said, for the use of the Mariners to accustom them to Sea: but most of
all were of opinion, that these were but shadows, and that the Spaniard was to
have taken advantage of the time. Howsoever upon this there followed a
Proclamation against Spanish money, that their money should not go current in
England, which caused many to suspect worse then the worst, and some said one
thing, some another: upon the neck of that comes wars in the Low Countries,
some say against the Palsgrave, some against the State. The Scots begin to fly
out in Rebellion, and are suppressed. The wild Irish in Ireland begin to stir,
sometimes thirty, sometimes forty, sometimes three hundred fly out and stand
upon their guard. These things minister occasion of wonder to the ignorant, and
many of them, who knew the truth of things, knew not what to say to it. Priests
come into the Kingdom by tens, fifteenes, twenty at a time, and have free
access, so that my Lord of Northampton (being Warden of the Cinque Ports)
begins to be called into question: Some say he has a hand in those things;
others say he lets Priests have their free access, and that in Bloomesberie
amongst his own buildings they have free harbor; others say, that through his
countenance, thither any man might go to public Mass, besides many other
Intelligences being brought from beyond the Seas draws him further into
suspicion, and the King begins to withdraw his favor from him, wherefore he
exhibits his Bill against such as defamed him into the Starchamber: some are
for this cause committed to the Tower, others to Newgate, others to the Fleet,
till they come to their Answer. And in the end openly in the Star Chamber he is
accused for suffering Priests to have free access into Yorkshire, under
pretense of his Office, for countenancing them, for sending Letters to and
again to encourage men in their opinions, and many other such like things.

And when the Lords should come to pass their voices, my Lord of Canterbury
amongst the rest made a speech to this effect: [That although many have been
the rumors and reports that had passed in these times, some of them shut up
for uncertain truths and flying fables; then entertained for approved truths;
yet nevertheless such things are grounded upon reason, and for which, men of
upright consciences have some occasion to speak, to have such either lightly
valued or punished, was rather injustice then any way beseeming the equity of
that Court: But in truth these whereof we now speak are grounded upon some
cause, and my Lords own Letters make evident, that he has done some things
both against his own conscience and meaning, merely to attain unto honor and
soveraigntie, and to please the King:] And with that he pulls out a Letter
written from my Lord to Cardinal Bellarmine to this effect: THat howsoever the
condition of the times compelled him, and His Majesty urged him to turn
Protestant, yet nevertheless his heart stood with the Papists, and that he
would be ready to further them in any attempt. This and much more being read,
to some purpose he proceeded, and showed how that those things were not merely
uncertain, but even the actions that followed them did justify them to be
true. For there was never known to be so many Priests to come over into this
Kingdom in so short a time as of late there had done, neither could he assure
himself that my Lord was true hearted unto the State. Also he harbored such
about him as would undertake to write in defense of the Gunpowder Treason.




This and much more being said, about the latter end of Easter Term, in the
year 1614. my Lord being hereat much discouraged, after the Court brake ^ooke
his Barge, went to Greenewich, there made his Will, wherein he published
himself to dye in the Faith he was Baptized, made some of his Servants his
Executors, others he bestowed gifts upon; his fair house he disposed to my
Lord Chamberlain, his Lands to my Lord Theophilus Howard; retired back to his
house at London, and before Midsommer Term following was dead.

Many were the rumors that were raised of this man after his death. That he
was a Traitor to the State, and that he was not dead, but carried beyond Sea to
blind the world, and the reason was, because he would be buried at Dover, and
not at London.

Others say, that if he had lived, he would have been the author of much
stir; many dislike him, and as was reported, even the King himself toward
his latter end, which made him to fall into these courses: but truly, he was a
notable politician, and carried things more commodiously for the Papists then
ever any before him. His Funeral was kept privately at Rochester, where he
desired to be buried, because it was the chief Port Town of his Office,
without any state to outward appearance. My Lord Treasurer that now is
succeeded him in his Treasurership. My Lord of Somerset made Chancellor of
Cambridge. My Lord Zouch Warden of the Cinque Ports. My Lord of Worcester some
short time after Lord privy Seal. These succeeded him in his Offices.

The Cloth-workers obtain their Petition. The old Charter of the Merchant
adventurers is seized into the Kings hands. The Dutch grow discontented at it.
The doubtfulnesse of Somerset's mind. He sues for his pardon; obtaines it. My
Lord Chancellor refuses to seal it. Falls into suspicion. Begins to be
neglected.
THe Cloth-workers still persisting in their suit, and having such strong
friends to stand for them, and Alderman Cocking a rich Merchant to back them,
they at length obtained what they desired, and Proclamation goes forth, that no
more white Cloth shall go over undied, undrest, and for this purpose the old
Charter of the Merchants Ad^enturers is seized into the Kings hands, so that
the Company fall to decay. Now the Dutchmen they begin to murmur against the
English, and make Proclamation there, that no man shall buy any such Cloths as
come over so dressed and dyed; wh^reupon, the English make a new Proclamation,
that no man shall tr^nsport Wooles out of the Kingdom. These things fed some
with hope of some further troubles, yet nevertheless it is so ordered by the
Council, that all things are pacified, and some quantity amounting to a
certain number of white Cloths are suffered to be transported, as well to give
content to the Hollander, as satisfaction and employment to some young Merchants
that had entered into this Trade, by which means these clamors are a little
stayed; yet nevertheless great impression of envy is between these two
Countries.

Now one of the greatest friends that Somerset had being dead, and himself
still jealous of his safety, he begins to cast about how he might avoid the
danger of the Law, for his intelligencers gave him notice of many desperate
words that were uttered concerning Overburie's death; whereupon, finding the
King in a good humor, he moves him to this effect: That whereas it had pleased
His Majesty to commit many things into his charge, and some of them proving
something too weighty for him to undergo, it was so, that ignorantly he run
himself into a Praemunire, whereby he had forfeited to him both his lands,
goods and liberty, and that he came now to surrender them all up into His
Majesty's hands, unless it pleased him of his wonted favor toward him to
grant him pardon for that, and many other offenses that he had ignorantly
committed. The King still bearing a good affection toward him, bid him draw
his pardon and he would sign it: whereupon, he makes his repair to Sir Robert
Cotton, and entreats him to look him a pardon, the largest he could find in
former presidents; so he brings him one that was made by the Pope to Cardinal
Woolsey. The effect of which was.

That the King of his mere motion and special favor, did pardon all, and all
manner of Treasons, misprisions of Treason, Murders, Felonies and outrages
whatsoever by the said Sir Robert Carre Earl of Somerset committed, or
hereafter to be committed; with many other words to make it more ample and
large according to form, which he caused to be drawn and engrossed, and
brought it into the King. The King signed it; at length it comes to my Lord
Chancellor's hand, he peruses it, and refuses to let it pass the Seal. My
Lord asks the reason, answer was made, That he could not justify the doing of
it, but that he should incur a praemunire as well as himself. This struck
Somerset to the heart, and now he was in greater doubt, then ever he was
before, for still he is stung with fear to be touched with Overburies death,
and so very pensively retires to White Hall, and there remains.

The King coming to London, my Lord Chancellor acquainted him with the Pardon,
and showed the King what danger he had incurred, in case he had sealed it. The
King perceiving the truth of the business, suspecting some greater matter then
he knew of, withdrawes his countenance from Somerset, who now wanting virtue to
support his greatness, without the Kings favor falls into the contempt of
many, and those that are his enemies neglect him, and do as it were deride his
manner of carriage, by which means he runs headlong into his own perdition,
as shall be hereafter showed.

My Lord Chancellor sued in the Star-thamber, for being within the compass of
a Praemunire. The King goes to Cambridge. A breach about Ignoramus. My Lord Coke
stands against my Lord Chancellor. The King graces Sir George Villers; Bestows
great honors upon him. Somersets courses to conceal Overburies death. His
covetousness; His insolency. He is crossed by Villers. The report of the vulgar.
IN this year (1614) the King, by the entreaty of Somerset, determined to go
to Cambridge, and there was entertained with great solemnity, but amongst the
rest, there was a Play called by the name of Ignoramus, that stirred up a great
contention between the common Lawyers and the Scholars, in so much as their
flouts grew unsufferable, but at last it was stayed by my Lord Chancellor, and
the explaining of the meaning.

About this time it happened, that diverse Citizens having recovered certain
sums of money in the Kings Bench, and thereof having had Judgment against
the party Defendant, nevertheless exhibites his Bill into the Chancery to have
relief of the Plaintiffes at the Common Law, having already had Judgment of
the same matter, there stands out, and disobeyes the Kings Process; whereupon
a Writ of Contempt issues against them, they are taken, committed to the Fleet,
and there continue in their obstinacy; nevertheless, not long after, upon some
advice, they exhibit their Bill into the Star Chamber against my Lord,
intending that he ought not to intermeddle with any matter that were already
determined at the Common Law, and whereof a Judgment had been passed: And this
was ordained by the Statute of 4. H. 4. cap. 23^ whereby it was enacted, that
Judgment given in the Kings Court, shall not be examined in Chancery,
Parliament, or elsewhere, until it be undone by attaint, or error, etc. Now
my Lord having laid them fast up upon a Bill exhibited before him, and
Judgment being already given, that therefore my Lord had incurred a Praemunire,
and humbly prayed relief in this case. Many were the opinions of Lawyers
concerning this matter; some stood on my Lord Chancellors side, some said the
poor men had injury, and that they might justify what they had done; and
amongst many my Lord Coke stood out very stiffely, that my Lord Chancellor
could not justify that action. And thus it stood still in question whether my
Lord be in a Praemunire, or no.

My Lord of Somerset continuing still in his loose courses, and utterly
neglecting that severity that ought to be in a man of his place, besides the
former suspicions and jealousies, gives occasion of others also, whereby the
King does more and more fall into dislike: There being at this time about the
Court a young Gentleman, that not long before had arrived from Travels out of
France, his name was Villers, a Leichestershire Gentleman, and of an ancient
House, who as well in respect of carriage, as of his countenance, was more
remarkable then many others. On this man the King casts a particular affection,
holding him to be the only properest and best deserving Gentlemen of England;
whereupon he entertained him into favor, bestows a thousand pound upon him,
after adornes him with the title of Knighthood. And now he begins to grow every
day more eminent then other, greater honors are bestowed upon him, as the
dignity to be Knight of the Garter, and Master of the Horse; places not common
to every person, and so much the more remarkable, because they are bestowed
upon him, being so young in years, his wisdom is commended of the wisest, and
his expectations greater then many that went before him.

This stings Somerset to the heart, to see another step to his place, he more
fears his subversion and downfall; wherefore he goes about to circumvent
danger, and for this purpose sends into France to make away the Apothecary that
administered the Physic that killed Sir Thomas, endeavoring to get in all
Letters and writings that had past concerning the business, and disgracing and
discountenancing all such as at any time once spoke of the death of Overbury,
to the intent that it might be concealed and kept close; but what God will have
disclosed, shall never be concealed: messengers are sent from place to place,
he being a Privy Councellor, (and in favor) his Warrant passes current, so
that in all places, Truncks, Chests, Boxes, Studies, Daries, and such houses
wherein he suspected any Letters or other matters that appertained to that
mischief lay hid, were broken open and se^rched, to the intent that they might
bring some writings to my Lord, yet nevertheless many (and more then were
dreamt on) of those Letters, came to my Lord of Canterburies hand, and my Lord
Coke^, so that those courses makes him rather more suspected, then any whit at
all eases his grief.

At home in his Office using extraordinary covetousness and parcimony, he
thereby heaped up to himself great store of money, and would not undertake any
enterprise without he was well rewarded for his pai^es, every new occasion and
occurrence that came to his hands, brought him in also a fleece of money.
Offices in Court that lay in his gift nor bestowed without money, the Kings
letters not purchased without money, no Pardon without money, so that he was as
great a Bribe-taker as his Mother the Countess of Suffolk, and many Rumors
and hard Reports were spread on him for the same, yet nevertheless he still
continued his favor in despite (as a man may say) of his opposites, even unto
the greatest dignity, which caused him to be as proud as covetous, and to
commit as many Insolences as he had received sesecret Bribes, thought it no
matter to lean on the Cushion in public ^o check some of the Nobility; and
amongst the rest to make a flat breach with my Lord of Canterbury, a grave and
reverend Gentleman, one of the Pillars of this Kingdom, and that could
discern the follies of this young man. Thus admiring of his own worth, he
works his own subversion, and by these insolences plucking more evils upon his
head, and daily adding more enemies, to those that before he had deserved.

These things laying him open to the envy of the greatest; and Sir George
Villers seeing his exceeding covetousness, having now the ears of the King,
would oftentimes cross his expectations, as it is credibly reported, and
deceive him of many a bribe which he hoped for, doing those things
voluntarily, and for a thank, which my Lord would not have spoken of without
much money. These courses laid him open to the contempt of the vulgar also: And
now all men according to their custom, began to exclaim of his great
extortion. Thus may we see him falling.

Overburies death called into question. Weston sent ^or, and by my Lord Coke
examined, stands out; Upon my Lord of Londons persuasion confesses all. The
Earl and Countess attached, they deny the deed. Sir Thomas Monson committed
to the Tower. Sir Walter Rawleigh and the Countess of Shrewsbury set at
liberty. The death of the Lady Arbella. The conviction of the Earl and
Coun^esse: The manner of their Arraignment, and the many rumors that were
spread upon these things.
THe death of Overbury having now lain consealed about two years, and the
Earls insolency growing every day greater then other, procures him many more
enemies, as is said, yet there was no man that was so hardy, for fear of the
Kings displeasure, (he carrying a very good affection still toward him) to
make him acquainted with it, or bring it to the trial of the Law. At last, for
diverse are the rumors how it was discovered; one was, that Sir Thomas
Overburies man petitioned to my Lord Coke, and the substance of the petition
was, to let his Lordship understand, that whereas his Master had been committed
to the Tower by the consent of Northampton and Somerset, and there languishing
to death unnaturally; that if it pleased his Lordship to call one Weston before
him, he might gather that out of him that might discover the whole plot and
practice. Others say that my Lord of Canterbury having conceived, (as is said)
some dislike against Somerset, and willing to make himself gracious with the
King, possessed Sir Ralph Wimrood with the business (one that was preferred to
be Secretary under my Lord of Somerset, and to assist him) and lets him
understand the whole matter, as has been related, and that many Letters came
unto his hands, and presumptious therein that it should be true: And there
remained a Truncke in such a place, wherein many writings were contained, that
would make evident the truth. Sir Ralph being willing likewise to become more
emi^ent with the King, possessed him with the business, and proceeding upon a
confident ground; Warrant was sent to my Lord Coke to prosecute the matter.
Others say, that by the loss of a Letter it was disclosed: And diverse opinions
there were how it should come to light, it having been kept close so long; For
things of this nature when they are so long concealed, bring more wonder; but
howsoever it was made known, my Lord Coke by virtue of his warrant sent for
Wes^on to come before him, and examined him upon diverse articles concerning
this subject, and persuaded him, entreated him, and threatened him to tell the
truth; Weston stood out, and would not, thus he persisted some week or
fortnight, many men urged him to it; Accusers were brought before him, and
deposed upon their oaths, that whatsoever was objected against him was true;
this little prevailed.

At last, my Lord of London went to him, and by his persuasions tells all how
Mistress Turner, and the Countess came acquainted, what relation sh^e had to
Witches, Sorcerers, Conjurers, that Northampton, Somerset, Francklin, the
Monsons, and Yeluis had their hands in that bu^inesse, whereupon they were all
apprehended, some sent t^ the To^er, others to Newgate, having thus con^e^^
this e^ill b^^^g convicted according to the course of Law, he was had to
Tiburne to be hanged, and there Sir Hi^les and others im^gining this to be but
a ^able, and that he was hired to accuse those p^r^^^s, (for who almost would
have believed it) examines him at the Gallows, and upon his examination he
justified what he had done^ to the great wonder of all those that stood by and
heard it. After him Mistress Tu^ner, after her F^an^klin, then Sir Ierva^^
Yeluis, upon their Arraignments of the Fact^, were found guilty, and hanged,
all very penitent and sorrowful for what was done.

To write the particulars of their arraignments, confessions, and the manner of
their deaths is needless, being common: Now the Countess and the Earl are
attached, and committed to protection, one to the Deane of Westminster, the
other to the Sheriff of London, and according to the course of such case^,
there are great reports raised, watch and ward kept more then ordinary, and the
guard more observant: This makes the King stand at a maze, and to imagine there
is no truth in men, grows more jealous of himself then heretofore, because
his only favorite, and that (as it were) in his bosom, should be intrapt in
such an evil: And the ^ongues of the vulgar began to walk, some say that
Northampton and Somerset had combined with the Spaniard for a sum of money to
deliver them up the Navy, and that Sir William Monson, Vice Admiral, should
have done it the next Spring: That the King and the whole State should have
been poisoned at the C^^istni^g of the Countess child, (for she was then with
child) and many more the like rumors were spread not worth the speaking, to
the intent to incense the people the more against them, and to make the matter
the more heinous and grievous to the world. At this time the Lady Arbella died,
a matter more remarkable then was observed, and gave some occasion of speech to
many, but yet nevertheless past over in silence.

These Hurly-burlies being grown somewhat calm, and the minds of men a little
settled, the Countess and others authorized for that purpose to be examined,
and my Lord Coke was the man that pressed the Evidence against them, which (as it
was thought) procured some great enemies, two and twenty Articles were objected
against them, Somerset pleaded Ignorance, and that these Objections were mere
tricks to entrap him, and set the King against him; The same answer was in the
Countess, and that it might rather seem to proceed out of envy, then for any
just cause. They cause it to be given out, that their accusations were
wrong^ull, and none were accused but such as were the greatest Favorites to
the King, so that there was much ado to little purpose. At last, when they
heard that Weston, Turner, Francklin, and Yeluis were all hanged, and that they
had confessed the matter, the Countess being brought before the Council,
confessed the whole truth, but Somerset stood to it still, that he was not agent
in it, and that these accusations did nothing touch him, and therefore ought to
be excused.

Nevertheless his lands and goods were committed to custody, part to my Lord
Treasurer, and part to others to the Kings use: The Money, Plate, and Jewels
which he had heaped up together, amounted, by report, unto 200000. pounds, his
lands 19000. pounds per annum, and the King bestowed many of them upon the
Prince. There was little speech of this, in respect that both person and
matter, wherein he was agent, were both envied, and facinerous, neither was
there any that pitied him, but most said, that hoe had but his just deserts,
for the injuries and wrongs that he offered unto Essex.

The Arraignment was put off, and in the mean time Sir Walter Rawleigh was set
at liberty. This man had continued in the Tower now almost ten years a
condemned person, for a plot intended against his Majesty at his first coming
in; he bore a great envy against Somerset, because he had begged his lands of
the King, and got it into possession, giving him many quips and taunts, during
the time that he was in the Tower. These two accidents happening beyond
expectation, that the one being the special favorite of the King, the other a
condemned man, the one imprisoned, the other set at liberty, gave great
occasion of speech and rumor, and so much the more wonder and admiration,
because of Rawleighes wit and policy.

And this year also the Countess of Shrewsbury, who was committed for being
privy to the escape of the Lady Arbella, was set at liberty, and the Earl her
husband dyed, leaving the greatest part of his land unto his daughters; during
all this time, that is, from Michaelmas Term, unto the short vacation,
between Easter and Trinity Term, the Arraignment was put off; some attributed
the cause to be, for because the Countess was with child, and in the mean
time was delivered of a daughter; some that further proofs of incertainties
might be brought in; others to give them longer time to consider on the matter,
and that it was a great favor; I say, these rumors being published amongst
the people; at length the King authorized my Lord Chancellor to be High Steward
of England for the time being, and joined eight of his Judges with him for his
assistance, viz. The four Judges of the Kings Bench, my Lord Chief Justice of
the Common Pleas, Justice Niccols, my Lord Chief Barron, and others of the
Barrons, with power to call Somerset and the Countess before them, to show
cause why they should not have sentence of death passed upon them for this
offense committed, both against the Laws of the Land, and against the King, his
Crown and Dignity. So upon the four and twentieth of May, in this year 1616.
There being a Seat Royal placed at the upper end of Westminster Hall, a little
short of the Kings Bench, and seats made round about it, for the rest of the
Justices and Peers to sit on, and a little cabin built close by the Common
Pleas, for the Prisoners, when they came from the Tower to be put to rest them
in: They proceed to the trial after this manner. As soon as my Lord High
Steward, with great State, came into Westminster Hall, with his assistants the
Judges, diverse Lords and Gentlemen attending, and four Serjants at Arms
before him, ascending a little gallery made of purpose to keep off the crowd,
he takes his seat, and the rest of the Assistants and Peers, according to
their places. This being done, after silence proclaimed, one of the Harrolds at
Arms reaches the High Steward his Patent, and delivers it to the Clerk of the
Crown to read it; After Sir Ralph Conis^y reaches him his staff, and i^ there
present, according to his place, to give attendance.

After the Patent read, and proclamation for silence, and that the accusers
should come in, the Prisoners were sent for by the Clerk of the Checker, whose
office it was to attend the Prisoners: This being done, and the Prisoners
placed at the Bar, Sir Henry Fanshaw reads the Indictment, to which the
Countess pleaded guilty, and confessed the fact: But Somerset pleaded not
guilty, and had time from ten of the clock at night to clear himself; much
was said, but to little purpose: At last, the Peers having conferred of the
matter, return their verdict, laying their hands upon their breasts, and
swearing by their Honors (for they do not m^ke an Oath as ordinary Jurors do)
that he was guilty of the murder, and poisoning of Sir Thomas Overbury;
whereupon my Lord High Steward pronounced sentence of death against him; and so
he was had back to the Tower, where he remains at the mercy of the King.
This man may justly say, as Pope Barbaressa said when he was put from the
Popedom. Qui modo summus eram laetatus nomine praecel
Tristis and abjectus, nunc mea fata gemo
Excelsus solio nuper versa^ar in alto
Cunctaque gens pedibus oscula prona dabant
Nunc ego poenarum sundo devulvor in imo
Vultum deformem pallidaque ore gero
Omnibus e terris aurum mihi sponte ferebant,
Sed nec gaesa juvet, nec quis amicus adest.
Sic varians fortuna vices adversa secundis
Su^dit and ambiguis nomine ludit atr^
Cedit in exemplum cunctis quos gloria tollit,
Vertice de summo mox ego Papa cado.
Lo here I am that sometime took delight in name of Pope,
Now being sad and abject do bewail my fate and hope
Of late preferred, I did converse with stately pomp and grace,
And every Nation to my feet their ready kisses place:
But now in dungeon deep am thrown of pains in mortal fear
A countenance pale, a body lean, deformed with grief I bear,
From all parts of the earth they brought me gold without constraint;
But now no gold, nor precious stones, nor friends can ease my plaint.
So variable Fortune is so nice to great attempts,
So subject and so doubtful too, so adverse in events,
That Atis with our name does play as with a tennis ball,
For being lifted up with fame, the greater is our fall:
Let this example be to such, whom Fortune does advan^e.
That they, as I by Popedom fell, may fall by like mischance.


For we cannot read of any that ever was so great a Favorite as Somerset,
neither the Spencers with Edward the second, nor the Earl of Warwick with
Henry the sixth, nor the Duke of Suffolk with Henry the eighth, as this man
was with the King; neither was there any that ever came to so sudden and
unexpected a fall.

They therefore that do but rightly consider this Discourse, shall find in it
three things worthy observation.

First, that neither honor nor wealth, are any certain inheritance, but
occasions (unless God be merciful unto us) for the devil to pick a quarrel
against us, to bring us to infamy.

Secondly, that God never leaves murder (though never so closely carried)
unpunished.

Lastly, that there was never known in so short a time, so many great men dye
with suspicion of poison and witchcraft; viz. First, my Lord Treasurer, the
Prince, my Lord Harrington, his son, Overbury, Northampton, besides these
which are no less then six other within three years and an half, and the two
Monsons which yet remain untryed.

Sir Francis Bacon his Speech at the Arraignment of the Earl of Somerset.
IT may please your Grace, my Lord High Steward of England, and you my Lords
the Peers, you have here before you Robert Earl to be tried for his life,
concerning the procuring and consenting to the impoysonment of Sir Thomas
Overbury, then the Kings Prisoner in the Tower of London, as an Accessory
before the Fact.

I know your hopes connot behold this Noble man, but you must remember the
great favors which the King has conferred on him, and must be sensible, that
he is yet a member of your body, and a Peer as you are, so that you cannot cut
him off from your body but with grief, and therefore you will expect from us,
that give in the Kings Evidence, sound and sufficient matter of proof to
satisfy your Honors and consciences.

As for the manner o^ the Evidence, the King our Master who (amongst other his
virtues, excels in that virtue of the Imperial Throne which is Justice) has
given us command that we should not expatiate nor make invectives, but
materially pursue the Evidence, as it conduces to the point in question.

A matter, that (though we are glad of so good a warrant) yet we should have
done of our selves; for far be it from us by any strains, or wit of Arts, to
seek to play prizes, or to bl^son our names in blood, or to carry the day
otherwise then upon sure grounds; we shall carry the Lantern of Justice,
(which is the Evidence) before your eyes upright, and to be able to salve it
from being put out with any grounds of evasion or vain defenses, that is our
parts, and within that we shall contain our selves, not doubting at all, but
that the Evidence it self will carry that force, as it shall need no
advantage, or aggravation.

First, my Lords, the course that I will hold in delivering of that which I
shall say, (for I love order) is this: First I will speak somewhat of the
nature and greatness of the offense, which is now to be tried, not to weigh
down my Lord with the greatness of i^, but rather contrariwise to show, that
a great offense needs a good proof. And that the King howsoever he might
esteem this Gentleman heretofore as the Signet upon his finger (to use the
Scripture phrase) yet in such a case as this, he was to put him off.

Secondly, I will use some few words touching the nature of the proofs, which
in such a case are competent.

Thirdly, I will state the proofs.

And lastly, I will produce the proofs, either out of examination, and matters
of writing, or witnesses viva voce.

For the offense it self, it is of crimes next unto high Treason the greatest,
it is the foulest of Felonies: It has three degrees of stages. First, it is
murder by impoysonment. Secondly, it is murder committed upon the Kings
prisoner in the Tower. Thirdly, I might say that it is murder under the color
of Friendship, but that it is a circumstance moral, and therefore I leave that
to the Evidence it self.

For murder, my Lords, the first record of Justice which was in the world, was
judgment upon a murderer, in the person of Adams first borne Ca^^e, and
though it was not punished by death, but with banishment, and mark of
ignominy, in respect of the primogenitors, or the population of the world, yet
there was a severe charge given, that it should not go unpunished.

So it appears likewise in Scripture, that the murder or Abner by Ioah,
though it were by David respited in respect of great services past, or reason
of State, yet it was not forgotten.

But of this I will say no more, because I will not discourse, it was ever
admitted and rancked in Gods own Tables, that murder is of offenses, between
man and man next unto high Treason, and disobedience to Authority, which
sometimes have been referred to the first Table, because of the Lieutenancie of
God in Princes the greatest.

For impoysonment, I am sorry it should be heard of in our Kingdom; It is not
nostri generis, nec sanguinis peccatum; It is an Italian com^it for the Court
of Rome, where that person that intoxicateth the Kings of the earth, is many
times really and materially intoxicated and impoysoned himself. But it has
three circumstances, which makes it grievous beyond other matters: The first
is, that it takes a man away in full peace in Gods and the Kings peace, that
thinks no harm, but is comforting of nature with resection and food, so that
as the Scripture says, His table is made a snare.

The second is, that it is easily committed, and easily concealed, and on the
other side ha^dly prevented, and hardly discovered; for murder by violence
Princes have Guards, and private men have houses, attendants, and arms,
neither can such murder be committed, but cum sonitu with some overt and
apparent acts, that may discover and trace the offenders; but for poison, the
cup it self of Princes will scarce serve in regard of many poisons that neither
discolor nor distaste; It comes upon a man when he is careless, and without
respect; and every day a man is within the gates of death.

And the last is, because it concerns not only the destruction of the
maliced man, but of every man, quis modo tutu^ erit, for many times the poison
is prepared for one, and is taken by another, so that men dye other men's
deaths, Concidit infelix alieno vulnere, and it is as the Psalmist calls it,
Sagitta no^^e volans, The arrow that flies by night, that has no aim nor
certainty; and therefore if any man shall say to himself, here is great talk
of impoysonment, but I am sure I am safe, for I have no enemies, neither have I
any thing another man should long for, why? that is all one, he may sit next
him at the table, that is meant to be impoisoned, and pledge him of his cup: As
we may see in the example of 21. H. 8. that where the purpose was to poison one
man, there was poison put into barme or yeast, and with that barme, pottage or
grewell was made, whereby sixteen of the Bishop of Rochesters servants were
poisoned; nay, it went into the alms-basket likewise, and the poor at the gate
were poisoned. And therefore with great judgment did the Statute made that
year touching this accident, made impoisonment high Treason, because it tends
to the dissolving of humane society, for whatsoever offense does so, is in the
nature thereof high Treason.

Now for the third degree of this particular offense, which is, that it is
committed upon the Kings prisoner, who was out of his own defense, and merely
in the Kings protection, and for whom the King and the State were a kind of
respondent; it is a thing that aggravates the fault much, for certainly (my
Lord of Somerset) let me tell you this, that Sir Thomas Overbury is the first
man that was murdered in the Tower of London, save the murder of the two
young Princes, by the appointment of Richard the third.

Thus much of the offense, now to the proofs.

For the nature of proofs, you may consider that imprisonment, of all offenses
is the most secret, even so secret, as that if in all cases of imprisonment,
you should require testimony, you should as good proclaim impunity.

Who could have impeached Livia by testimony, for the poisoning of the sigges
upon the tree, which her husband was wont to gather with his own hands; who
could have impeached Parasetis for the poisoning of the one side of the knife
she carried with her, and keeping the other side clean, so that her self did
eat of the same piece of meat that they did, whom she did impoyson.

These cases are infinite, and need not to be spoken of the secrecy of
impoysonment, but wise men must take upon them in these secret cases Salomons
spirit, that when there could be no witnesses, collected the act by the
affection: But yet we are not at our cause, for that which your Lordships is to
try, is not the act of impoysonment, for that is done to your hands; all the
world by Law is concluded to say, that Overbury was poisoned by Weston, but the
question before you is of the procurement only, and as the Law terms it as
accessory before the fact, which abetting is no more, but to do or use any act
or means which may aid or conduce to the impoisonment.

So that it is not the buying nor the making of the poison, nor the preparing,
nor confecting, nor commixing of it, or the giving or sending, or laying of the
poison, that are the only acts that do amount unto the abetment; but if there
be any other act, or means done, or used to give opportunity of impoysonment,
or to facilitate the execution of it, or to stop or divert any impediments that
might hinder it, and that it be with an intention to accomplish and atchieve
the impoysonment; all these are abetments and accessaries before the fact: As
for example, if there be a conspiracy to murder a man as he journeyeth on the
way, and it be one man's part to draw him forth to that journey by invitation,
or by color of some business; and another takes upon him to dissuade some
friend, of his company, that he be not strong enough to make his defense; and
another has a part to hold him in talk till the first blow be given; all
these, my Lords, without scruple are accessaries to the murder, although none
of them give the blow, nor assist to give the blow.

My Lords, he is not the hunter alone that lets slip the dog upon the Dear,
but he that lodges him, and hunts him out, or sets a train or trap for him,
that he cannot escape, or the like.

But this, my Lords, little needs in this case, for such a chain of acts of
impoisonment as this, I think were never heard nor seen.

And thus much of the nature of the Proofs.

To descend to the Proofs themselves, I shall keep this course.

First, I will make a narration of the fact it self.

Secondly, I will break and distribute the proofs as they concern the
Prisoner.

And thirdly, according to the distribution, I will produce them, or read them
to use them.

So that there is nothing that I shall say, but your Lordships shall have three
thoughts or cogitations to answer it.

First, when I open it, you may take your aim.

Secondly, when I distribute it, you may prepare your answers without confusion.

And lastly, when I produce the witnesses, or the examinations themselves, you
may again ruminate, and readvise to make your defense.

And this I do because your memory and understanding may not be oppressed, or
overladed with length of evidence, or with confusion of order; nay more, when
your Lordships shall make your answer in your time, I will put you in mind
where cause shall be of your omission.

First, therefore Sir Thomas Overbury for a time was known to have great
interest and straight friendship with my L. of Somerset, both in his meaner
fortunes, and after, in so much that he was a kind of oracle of direction unto
him, and if you will believe his own vaunts, (being indeed of an insolent and
thrasenicall disposition) he took upon him that the fortunes, reputation, and
understanding of this Gentleman (who is well known to have an able teacher)
proceede^ from his company and counsel, and this friendship rested not only in
conversation and business at Court, but likewise in communication of secrets
of Estate, for my Lord of Somerset exercising at that time by his Majesty's
special favor and trust, the Office of Secretary provisicually, did not
^orbeare to acquaint Overbury with the Kings Packets, and dispatches from all
p^^ts of Spain, France, and the Low Countries; and this not by glimses, or now
and then rounding in the ear for a favor, but in a settled manner Packets were
sent, sometimes opened by my Lord, sometimes unb^oken unto Overbury, who
perused them; copied them, registered them, made table^talke of them, as they
thought good. So I will undertake the time was, when Overbury knew more of the
Secrets of Estate then the Council Table did; nay, they were grown to such
inwardnesse, as they made a play of all the world besides themselves, so as
they had Ciphers and Jurgons for the King and Queen, and great men of the
Realm, things seldom used, but either by Princes or their Confederates, or at
the least by such as practice and work against, or at the least, upon Princes.

But understand me, my Lord, I shall not charge you with disloyalty this day,
and I lay this for a foundation, that there was great Communication of Secrets
between you and Sir Thomas Overbury, and that it had relation to matter of
State, and the great causes of this Kingdom.

But my Lords, as it is a principle in Nature, that the best things are in
their corruption the worst, and the sweetest wine makes the sowrest vinegre;
so fell it out with them, that this excess, as I may say, of friendship ended
in mortal hatred on my Lord of Somersets part.

I have heard my Lord Steward say sometimes in the Chanc^ry, that Frost and
Fraud ends soul; and I may add a third, and that is the Friendship of ill
men, which is truly said to be conspiracy, and not friendship. For it fell out
some twelve months or more before Overbury his imprisonment in the Tower, that
the Lord of Somerset sell into an unlawful love toward that unfortunate
Lady, the Countess of Essex, and to proceed to a Marriage with Somerset; This
Marriage and purpose did Overbury mainly impugn under pretense to do the true
part of a friend, for that he accounted her an unworthy woman.

But the truth was, Overbury, who (to speak plainly) had little that was
sollide for Religion or moral virtue, but was wholly possessed with ambition,
and vainglory, was loath to have any partners in the favor of my Lord of
Somerset, and especially not any of the House of the Howards, against whom he
had always professed hatred and opposition.

And, my Lords, that this is no sinister construction, will appear to you,
when you shall hear, that Overbury made his brags to my Lord of Somerset, that
he had won him the love of the Lady by his Letters and industry; so far was he
from cases of conscience in this point.

And certainly, my Lords, howsoever the tragical misery of this poor
Gentleman, Overbury, might somewhat obliterate his faults, yet because we are
not upon points of civilitie, but to discover the face of Truth before the face
of Justice, for that it is material to the true understanding of the state of
this cause. Overbury was naught and corrupt; the ballads must be mended for
that point.

But to proceed, when Overbury saw that he was like to be possessour of my
Lords Grace, which he had possessed so long, and by whose greatness he had
promised himself to do wonders, and being a man of an unbounded and impudent
spirit, he began not only to dissuade, but to deter him from the love of
that Lady, and finding him fixed, thought to find a strong remedy; supposing
that he had my Lords head under his girdle, in respect of communication of
Secrets of State, as he calls them himself secrets of Nature, and therefore
dealt violently with him, to make him desist with menaces of discovery, and the
like: Hereupon grew two streams of hatred upon Over^ury, the one from the
Lady, in resp^ct that he crossed her love, and abused her name, (which are
^uries in women) the other of a more deep nature, from my Lord of Somerset
himself, who was afraid of Overburies Nature, and that if he did break from
him and fly out, he would wind into him and trouble his whole fortunes; I
might add a third s^reame of the Earl of Northamptons Ambition, who desires
to be first in favor with my Lord of Somerset, and knowing Ove^^uries malice
to himself, and to his House, thought that man must be removed and cut off, so
as certainly it was resolved and decreed, that Overbury must dye.

Hereupon they had vari^ty of devices to send him beyond the Seas upon occasion
of employment.

That was too weak, and they were so far from giving way to it, as they
crossed it; there rested but two ways of quarrel, assault, and poison. For
that of assault, after some proposition and attempt, they passed from it, was a
thing too open and subject to more variety of shame; that of poison likewise
was an hazardous thing, and subject to many preven^ions and caution, especially
to such a working and jealous brain as Overbury had, except he was first fast
in their hands; therefore the way was first to get him into a trap and lay him
up, and then they could not miss the mark; and therefore in execution of this
plot, it was denied, that he should be designed to some honorable employment
in foreign parts, and should underhand by my Lord of Somerset be encouraged
to refuse it; and so upon contempt he should be laid prisoner in the Tower, and
then they thought he should be close enough, and death should be his Bail, yet
were they not at their end, for they considered, that if there were not a fit
Lieutenant of the Tower ^or their purpose, and likewise a fit Underkeeper of
O^^r^ury: First, they should meet with many impediments in the giving and the
exhibiting of the poison: Secondly, they should be exposed to note an
observation that might discover them: And thirdly, Overbury in the mean time
might write clamorous and ^urious Letters to his friends, and so all might be
disappointed: And therefore the next linck of the chain was to displace the
then Lieutena^^ Wade, and to place Yeluis, a principal abettor in the
impoysonment, to displace Carry that was Underkeeper in Wades ^ime, and to place
Weston, that was the Actor in the impoysonment. And this was done in such a
while, that it may appe^re to be done, as it were, in a breath.

Then when they had this poor Gentleman in the Tower close p^isoner, where he
could not escape, nor stir, where he could not feed, but by their hands, where
he could not speak or write, but through their truncks, then was the time to
act the last day of his tragedy.

Then must Francklin, the purveyour of the Poison, procure five, six, seven
several Poisons, to be sure to hit his complexion: Then must Mistress Turner,
the Lay Mistress of the Poisons, advise what works at present, and what at
distance: Then must Weston be the tormentour, and chase him with Poison after
Poison, Poison in salt meats, Poison in sweet meats, Poison in medicines and
vomits, until at last his body was almost come by use of Poison to the state
of Mithridates body by the use of Treacle, and preservatives, that the force
of the Poisons was blunted upon him; Weston confessing, when he was chid for
not dispatching him, that he had given him enough to poison twenty men.

And lastly, because all this asked time, courses were taken by Somerset, both
to divert all the true means of Overburies delivery, and to entertain him
with continual Letters, partly with hopes and protestations for his delivery,
and partly with other fables and negotiations, somewhat like some kind of
persons which keep in a tale of fortune telling, when they have a felonious
intent to pick their pocket, and pur^es.

And this is the true narration of this act, which I have summarily recited.

Now for the distribution of the Proofs, there are four heads to prove you
guilty, whereof two are precedent to the impoysonment, the third is present,
and the ^ourth is following or subsequent, for it is in Proofs, as it is in
lights^ there is a direct light, and there is a direct light, and there is a
reflection of light, and a double light.

The first head or Proof thereof is, that there was a root of bitterness, a
mortal malice or hatred mixed with a deep and bottomless mischief that you
had to Sir Thomas Overbu^y.

The second is, that you were the principal Actor, and had your hand in all
those acts, which did conduce to the impoysonment, and gave opportunity to
effect it, without which, the impoysonment could never have been, and which
could seem to tend to no other end, but to the impoysonment.

The third is, that your hand was in the very impoysonment it self, that you
did direct Poison, and that you did deliver Poison, and that you did
continually harken to the success of the impoysonment, and that you spurred it
on, and called ^or dispatch, when you thought it lingered.

And lastly, that you did all things after the impoisonment, which may detect a
guilty conscience for the smothering of it, and the avoiding of punishment for
it, which can be but of three kinds.

That you suppressed as much as in you was, testimony, that you did de^ace,
destroy, clip, and misdate all writings that might give light to the
impoysonment; and you did fly to the Altar of guiltiness, which is a Pardon of
murder, and a P^rdon ^or your self, and not for your self.

In th^^, my Lord, I convert my speech unto you, because I would have you alter
the points of your charge, and so make your d^^ence the better.

And two of these heads I have taken to my self, and left the other ^o the
Kings two Sergeants.

For the first maine part, which is the mortal malice coupled with fear that
was in you to Sir Thomas Overbury, although you did palliate it with a great
deal of hypocrisy and dissimul^tion even to the very end, I will prove it, my
Lord Steward, the root of this hate was that which cost many a man's life, that
is fear of discovering of Secrets, I say, of Secrets of a dangerous and high
nature, wherein the course that I will hold shall be this.

I will show that a breach and malice was betwixt my Lord and Overbury, and
that it burst forth into violent threats, and menaces on both sides.

Secondly, that these Secrets were not of a light, but an high nature, I will
give you the elevation of the Pole, they were such, as my Lord of Somerset had
made a vow, that Overbury should neither live in Court, nor Country; that he
had likewise opened himself so far, that either he or himself must dye for
it; and of Overburies part he had threatened my Lord, that whether he did live
or die, my Lords shame should never dye, but that he would leave him the most
odious man in the wo^ld: And ^urther, that my Lord was like enough to repent
where Overbury wrote, which was in the Tower of London, he was a Prophet in
that; so there is the highest of the Secret.

Thirdly, I will show you that all the Kings business was by my Lord put into
Overburies hands, so as there is work enough for Secrets, whatsoever they
write them; and like Princes Confederates they had their Ciphers and their
Jurgons.

And lastly, I will show you that i^ was but a toy to say the malice was only
in ^espect he spoke dishonourably of the Lady, or for doubt of breaking the
Marriage, for that Overbury was ^oadjutor to that love, and the Lord of
Somerset was as deep in speaking ill of the Lady as Overbury: and again, it
was too late for that matter, for the bargain of the match was then made, and
past; and if it had been no more then to remove Overbury for disturbing the
match, it had been an easy matter to have landed over Overbury, for which they
had a fair way, but that would not serve.

And lastly, periculum periculo vincitur, to go so far as an impoysonment, must
have a deeper malice then flashes, for the cause must have a proportion in the
effect.

For the next general head or proof, which consists in the acts preparatory,
or middle acts, they are in eight several points of the Compass, as I may
term them.

First, there were diverse devices and projects to set Overburies head on work
to dispatch him, and to overthrow him, plotted between the Countess of
Somerset, and the Earl of Somerset, and the Earl of Northampton, before they
fell upon the impoysonment, for always before men fix upon a course of
mischief, there will be some rejection, but dye he must one way or other.

Secondly, that my Lord of Somerset was principal practiser, I must speak it,
in a most perfidious manner, to set a train and trap for Overbury to get him
into the Tower, without which they durst not attempt the impoysonment.

Thirdly, that the placing of the Lieutenant Yeluis, one of the impoysonments
was done by my Lord of Somerset.

Fourthly, that the placing of Weston the Underkeeper, who was the principal
impoysoner, and the displacing of Carey, and the doing all this within the
while of fifteen days after Overburies commitment, was by the means and
countenance of my Lord of Somerset. And these were the active Instruments of
the impoysonment, and this was a business the Ladies power could not reach
unto.

Fifthly, that because there must be a cause of this Tragedy to be acted, and
chiefly because they would not have the Poisons work upon the sudden, and for
that the strength of Overburies natnre, or the very custom of receiving the
Poisons into his body, did overcome the Poisons that they wrought not so fast;
therefore Overbury must be held in the Tower, as well as he was laid in; and as
my Lord of Somerset got him into the Trap, so he keeps him in, and abuses him
with continual hope of liberty, but diverted all the true and effectual
means of his liberty, and makes light of his sickness and extremities.

Sixthly, that not only the plot of getting Overbury into the Tower, and the
devises to hold and keep him there, but the strange manner of the close
keeping of him, being in but for a Contempt, was by the device and means of my
Lord of Somerset, who denied his father to see him, denied his servants that
offered to be shut up close prisoners with him, and in effect handled it so,
that he made him close prisoner to all his friends, and exposed to all his
enemies.

Seventhly, that all the advertisement the Lady received from time to time,
from the Lieutenant or Weston, touching Ove^buries state of body, and health,
were ever sent nigh to the Court, though it were in Progress, and that from my
Lady such a thirst and listening he had to hear that he was disp^tched.

Lastly, that there was a continual negoti^tion to set Over^u^ies head on
work, that he should make some to cle^re the Honor of the Lady, and that he
should be a good ins^rument toward her, and her friends; all which w^^ but
enter^ainment: For your Lordships shall see diver^ of my Lord of Northamptons
Letters (whose hand was d^epe in this business) written, I must say in dark
word^, a^^ clauses, that there was one thing pretended, and anot^er thing
i^tended. That there was a real charge, and somewhat not re^ll, a main drift
and dissimulation; n^y further, there be some p^ss^g^s, which the Peers in
their wisdoms will discern, to point directly at the impoisonment.

FINIS.
