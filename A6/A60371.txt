AND COUNSEL, Given forth by JOSEPH SLEIGH Of the CITY of DUBLIN, In the time
of his Sickness, TO HIS CHILDREN.

And since his Death it being thought fit for the Service of others also;
therefore it was ordered into Print, that other Children, etc. may have the
Benefit thereof.

Printed in the Year 1683.

Advice from a Father, in the time of his Weakness of Body, unto his tender
Children.
My dear Children,
REmember your Creator in the days of your youth, in your young years, before
the Enemy of your Souls draw your Minds out into the Wickedness and Ungodliness
of the World, to defile your Hearts and Minds with the Wickedness and
Profaneness there of; and so harden your Hearts in Sin and Ungodliness; which
will bring Woe and Misery upon your Souls, and anguish of Spirit, and bitter
Lamentation, and provoke the Anger of the Lord against you. This is the work of
the Destroyer of Souls, the Devil, who goes about like a roaring Lion, seeking
whom he may devour. And no sooner Children grow up to years of understanding,
but this Enemy comes to tempt them, and draw them into evil, and into those
things which are contrary to the pure Mind and Will of the Lord; some into one
thing, and some into another, according as they are naturally inclined; some to
Wildness and Rudeness, some to Pride, some to Stubborness and
Self-conceitedness; some to one vanity and some to another. This is the work of
the Destroyer.

Therefore, my Children, my Advice to you in tender love is; that you wait upon
the Lord in the stilness and coolness of your Minds, in the silence of all
flesh, or fleshly thoughts or cogitations, that you may receive Wisdom and
Strength from the Lord, to withstand the Enemy of your Souls: For, as it is
written in the Scriptures of Truth, They that wait upon the Lord shall renew
their Strength; for none are able to overcome the Enemy, but they that know the
renewing of his Strength; for of your selves (as Christ said) you can do
nothing: and an overcoming there must be, or else no entering into that Rest,
which is without end.

My dear Children, you have immortal Souls that shall never die; but shall be
sensible either of everlasting Joy and Felicity with the Lord, and with the
Godly in Generations past, in the Kingdom of unspeakable Glory for evermore; or
for ever feel the Anger and Indignation of the Lord with the wicked and
ungodly, in the Hell of eternal Woe and Misery, which is a deplorable state.

And as there is but these two states for the Soul to remain in after Death;
the one Joy and Comfort, the other Woe and Misery: so there are but two ways,
the one is the straight and narrow way that leads to Life, the other the
broad way that leads to the Chambers of Death: So you see there is but one
way to Life eternal, even the straight and narrow way; although you will see
many ways in the world; one saying, this is the way, another sort saying, nay,
but this is the way: and so various sorts of Religions in the world, every one
crying up their several Notions to be the way to the City of Peace and Rest,
which (upon your viewing of it in your Minds) may raise doubts, and cause some
Considerations in your Minds. And from the considering of things you may reason
within your selves; Here are many sorts of Ways and Religions in the world, and
all pretend to be the right way; and how shall we do to know the one right way
amongst those many ways; for there is but one right way: and we may spend all
our days in running from one Religion to another to find the right way, and may
miss of it at last; and so lay down our heads in Sorrow.

Answer. Christ says, he is the Way, the Truth and the Life; and it is said in
the Scriptures of Truth, that Christ enlightens every one that comes into the
world: And when Christ talked with the Woman at the Well of Samaria about
Worship, and the place of Worship, (there being, at that day, a difference
between the Samaritans and the Jews about the place of Worship, as appears by
the Woman's words to Christ, when she said, Our Fathers worshipped in this
Mountain, and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to
worship;) Christ says, Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when ye shall
neither in this Mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father. Ye worship
ye know not what: we know what we worship: for Salvation is of the Jews. But
the hour comes, and now is, when the true Worshippers shall worship the Father
in Spirit and in Truth; for the Father seeks such to worship him. God is a
Spirit, and they that worship him, must worship him in spirit, and in truth.
Joh. 4.20, 21, 22, 23, 24.

So this is the true way to worship the Father, set up by Christ Jesus the
Shepherd and Bishop of the Souls; the spiritual Worship which is to continue:
And Paul says, what may be known of God, is made manifest in man: And Christ
forbids to run after those who turn peoples minds outward, to look for the way
to the Kingdom, saying, lo here, or lo there: for behold, the Kingdom of God in
within you. Luke 17.21.

Now if the Kingdom be within, of necessity must man's Guide be there also; as
the Apostle says, Try your selves, prove your selves; know ye not how that
Christ is in you, except ye be Reprobates?

So here is Christ, the way to the Father, near in your Hearts, to guide,
teach, admonish and reprove, and to justify those that are his faithful
followers: So if you want Counsel, you may wait in the coolness and stilness of
your Minds, and Counsel you will receive. If you be like to faint in your
travel, Christ the way will be as the Shadow of a mighty Rock in a weary Land:
If you be thirsty, he will be to you as a Well of Water to refresh your Souls,
If you hunger, he will feed you with the Bread of Life, and clothe you with his
Spirit: And if you keep the word of his Patience, he will preserve you in the
hour of temptation.

But it may be objected and said; How shall we know the Teachings of Christ by
his Spirit in our hearts, from the Suggestions of the Enemy of our Souls; which
is also a Spirit?

Answer. That which reproves thee in secret for evil committed by thee (when no
eye, it may be, saw thee) is the Spirit of Truth, which leads into all Truth,
and Righteousness, and leads those who give up to be led by it, into the
paths of Holiness, without which none shall see God, (as faith the Scriptures
of Truth) and condemns evil thoughts when they arise in the Creature, before
they come forth to actions; and leads men to deny all Ungodliness and worldly
Lusts, and to live godlily and soberly in this present evil world; and teaches
people to be true to God, and also to man; and to deal honestly with all men;
and to do to every one, as they would have every one do to them.

And this good Spirit teaches Children to be dutiful to their Parents, and
teaches Servants to serve their Masters faithfully, (not as eyeservants, but as
knowing there is an All-seeing Eye that sees all things:) It leads into all
good, and is the Author of all good; and as the Beams of the Sun that shines
into our houses comes from the Sun, and draws to the Sun again, being its
Center; so this measure of Divine Light, that proceeds from the Sun of
Righteousness, shines into the Hearts of the Sons and Daughters of men; and
directs (by the Beams or Rays of its Glory) to Christ the Fullness: so brings
people into the Nature of Christ; and so such become true born Christians, born
of the Spirit, and led by the Spirit into that which is sober and of a good
report, and into that which adorns Christianity, (to wit) a good Life, and a
blameless Conversation; for that is true Religion that visits the Fatherless and
the Widow, and keeps themselves unspotted of the World [mark that]. But the
wicked Spirit, the Enemy of man's Good and Happiness leads into all manner of
Wickedness, leads Children to disobey their Parents, to be false to their
Masters, to be false to their Neighbors, to be headdy and high-minded, lovers
of Pleasure more than lovers of God; leads to Strife, Envy, Malice, Murders,
Adultery, Theft, and all manner of evil, in order to destroy the Soul.

And so by this (my dear Children) you may know the right Spirit from the
wrong; as a Tree is known by its Fruits and a Fountain by the Water it brings
forth; Can a Fountain bring forth both sweet Water and bitter? as says the
Scripture by way of question: So, in short, the one leads into all good, and
the contrary into all evil.

And these Ministers that direct peoples Minds to the measure of Light and
Grace in their own hearts, and teach people to love the Light, and obey the
Light, that they may be Children of the Light; and to wait in that which
manifests Sin and Evil, and be subject to its leadings and guidings, that Power
may be received to overcome Sin and Evil; that so the works of the Devil may be
destroyed, and a Victory in the Dominion of the Spirit, and Power of Truth, may
be known over all Sin and Uncleanness, that Christ may rule and reign in your
hearts; (these are the Ministers of Christ whose Kingdom is Love, Peace, and
Joy to the Soul) and that this was the end of Christ's coming to destroy the
work of the Devil, and to present men to the Father without spot or wrinkle, or
any such thing; and that nothing that is unclean enter the Kingdom of Heaven,
(as says the Scripture;) and direct people to Christ the Bishop and Pastor of
their Souls, that they may witness Power from him to overcome the wicked one;
and so bring not only to the Form of Godliness, but to the Power also; and for
their Service and Labor of Love, desire no man's Silver or Gold, or Apparel;
but bear their Testimony (according to the Scriptures) against those that
preach for hire, and divine for money, and seek their gain from their Quarter,
and eat the Fat, and clothe with the Wool, and prepare War against those that
will not put into their Mouths; whose God is their Belly, whose Glory is their
Shame, who love and seek earthly things; and live in Pride and Idleness upon
the Sweat of poor men's Labors, and matter not what become of their Souls, and
preach up Sin term of Life; and do not obey Christ's Commands, who said to his
Ministers, when he sent them out, freely you have received, freely give; and as
the Spirit said through the Prophet every one that is thirsty come and buy Milk
and Wine without money, and without price: I say, these Ministers as hold forth
this Doctrine as aforesaid (in a pure Life and Conversation, in the movings of
his Spirit) are the Ministers of Christ, as aforesaid: But they that tell
people, they must sin term of life, and it is impossible to overcome the Devil;
but people must live in sin so long as they live in this world, and it cannot
be otherwise: contrary to the Scripture, which says, If we walk in the Light,
as he is in the Light, then have we fellowship one with another; and the Blood
of Jesus Christ his Son cleanses us from all sin; and John bore testimony of
Christ, that he was the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world: and
his Name was called Jesus, because he was to save his people from their sins,
not in their sins; for all sin is of the Devil, and they that plead for sin,
plead for the Devils Kingdom, and are his Ministers, and not the Ministers of
Christ; for Christ and his Ministers preached up Holiness, and Righteousness,
and Innocence; and endeavored to bring man up into that state in which man was
before he fell: The first Man Adam was of the earth earthly; but the second Man
was the Lord from Heaven, a quickening Spirit (as says the Scriptures,) to
renew and quicken man, who was dead from God by reason of Disobedience, and
brings man again into that state and image that he was in before he sell; and
so into that love and unity with his Maker, which he had in the beginning,
before Sin was, and before there was any Preachers up of Sin and Disobedience,
term of Life: For the first that preached up Disobedience to Gods Commandments
(which are holy and good) was the Serpent, the Devil, the Enemy of man's
Happiness; and he did it under a pretense to please that Mind that would fain
have Liberty to Evil, saying, they should be wise, as Gods, knowing good and
evil; and by giving way to that Sin-pleasing Doctrine, Death came over their
Souls: So these Priests, or Teachers, that preach up Sin and Disobedience term
of life: they may see their original, the Serpent; and if they repent not; but
continue in their obstinacy and evil serpentine Doctrine, they will come (with
him) under the Curse and Indignation of God, as the Serpent did.

So my dear Children, have a care of these Deceivers, and rather choose (with
good Moses) to endure affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the
pleasures of Sin for a season; for they that will live godly in Christ Jesus
must suffer Persecution.

As I have given you some marks before of false Ministers, (which are Teachers
of the false Church): so here is another mark that you may be certain of to be
a mark of a false Church, and that is Persecution about Religion: for the true
Church never did persecute; but was persecuted, and suffered persecution in all
ages, by the false Worshippers, who had the Form of Godliness, but denied the
Power; from such we are commanded to turn away.

So dear Children, where ever you see this mark, you may conclude those to be
false Worshippers and a false Church; and Cain that murdered his Brother
(about Religion) to be their Father (being led by his Spirit,) and the Reward
of Cain they will have (if they repent not,) which is, to be driven out from
the presence of the Lord, and to become a Vagabond, and be made to cry out (as
Cain was) my punishment is greater than I can bear.

The Spirit of Christ, that dwells in the true Church, teaches his people to
love their Enemies, to do good to those that hate them, and despitefully use
them, that they may be the Children of their Father which is in Heaven; for he
makes his Sun to rise on the evil, and on the good; and sends Rain on the
just and on the unjust, Matthew. 5.44, 45. and to desire the good of all even the
Salvation of their Souls, according to Christ's Command, when he was in the body
of Flesh upon the earth.

So, my dear Children, through the Love and Desire that is in my heart for your
Souls good, that you may come to live the life of the righteous, and so have
the righteous Reward, which is Peace and Joy and Unity with the Lord to all
eternity; and that when you come to lay down your Heads in the Dust, you may
have Peace with the Lord, which is of more value than an earthly Crown.

My heart is opened to write these few Lines unto you, to leave behind, as a
further Legacy of my Love unto you, which (as ye come to years of
understanding) I desire you to read and consider, in the same Love that moved
me to write this, and to leave it behind me, and let it have an impression upon
your Spirits, as the Advice of a loving and tender Father.

My dear Lambs, fear and love the Lord above all things, and seek first the
Kingdom of Heaven and the Righteousness thereof, and all other things the Lord
will add, and he will bless you with his Blessings, and will provide for you,
and be a tender Father unto you; and you shall want nothing that is good for
you, but your heavenly Father will provide it for you, as you keep in his Fear,
in the humility of your Souls, in a heavenly dependency upon him the Giver of
all good.

And, my dear Lambs, as you grow up to understanding, let your Minds be upon
heavenly things, and wait upon the Lord, that you may feel his Power and Life,
that will season your Souls, and draw your Affections Heavenward, into
Sobriety, Chastity and Moderation in every thing, both in your eating,
drinking, apparel, and in every thing else that you may make use of in the
Creation, tha tthe Lord God of my Life may bless you.

And, dear Lambs, have a care of letting your Minds ont, to mind and take
delight in the pleasures and vanities of this world, which will endure but for
a moment, in comparison of Eternity: And if you feel the Enemy drawing, and
laying before you the pleasures of this world, in order to draw your minds from
God; wait upon the Lord in that which shows you that they are the Suggestions
of the Enemy of your Souls, and the Lord will give you power to withstand him,
and to deny his Temptations; for the same that manifests Sin, will (as you wait
in it upon the Lord) give you power over Sin; for the Spirit and Power of God
in man has more power (as man gives up to be led by it) to preserve from Sin
and evil, than the wicked Spirit has to draw into Sin; as, says the
Scripture, greater is he that is in us, than he that is in the world.

So, my dear Lambs, wait upon the Lord, that you may see him in all his
appearances; for he is a Destroyer, and goes about like a roaring Lion seeking
whom he may devour.

So, as you tender the good and happiness of your Souls, be faithful to the
Lord in all states and conditions; and keep good Company, those that sear the
Lord; and be willing to receive the Advice of such in all your undertakings:
and if it be so ordered, that you be Servants to any, get into honest Families,
those that fear and love the Lord; that you may be instructed and brought up in
that which is good; and be faithful, true and honest in your Services, and be
subject to those you may serve, in all honest and lawful things, and then the
Lord will bless you, and you will be a Blessing in the Family you dwell in, and
good example to your Fellow Servants, which is well pleasing to the Lord.

And if it be so ordered, that you my Sons live until you be men, and that you
desire to marry; my Advice to you is, that ye mind from what ground your Love
springs; and consider things well in the Fear of the Lord; and be not taken
with every thing that may arise in your hearts; but be willing to be advised by
such whom you judge do fear the Lord: in that weighty concern, have an eye to
Virtue morethan outward Riches in your choice of Wives.

And you my Daughters, if it be so ordered of the Lord, that ye live till you
come to Women's estate, be not ready to receive every one that may profer love
to you, as in relation to Marriage; but wait upon the Lord for Counsel and
Advice: and take advice of those who you judge do fear the Lord; and keep your
selves sober and chaste in the Fear of the Lord; and no doubt but you will do
well. My Will and Desire is, that you all be advised in all things and
concerns, that are any thing weighty, by my Executors and Overseers, who (I
hope) will be ready to give their Advice.

And when you come to keep Families, and have Dealings and Trading in the
world, have an eye to the Truth, that you may do nothing to dishonor it: but
in your Trading and Dealings you behave your selves uprightly and justly to all
men, that so by your holy Lives and Conversations Truth may be well spoken of,
which will cause the Lord to bless your Endeavors. And if Riches increase, set
not your hearts upon them; but do good with them, having an eye to the Giver:
and keep in a holy dependency upon the Lord; and in all states learn to be
content, and keep your eye to the Lord over exercises and troubles, inwardly
and outwardly, which you may meet with in this world, that your Consciences may
be preserved without offense toward God and all men, that in the end you may
lay down your heads in peace with the Lord, which is better than a thousand
worlds.

So, my dear Lambs, I would have you read these Lines over often, and observe
them, that your Souls may be preserved from hurt; being written in dear Love to
your Souls, from your tender Father,

JOSEPH SLEIGH.
Dublin the 11th. Month, 1683.
A Testimony concerning Joseph Sleigh of Dublin, who departed this Life the 2d.
day of the 6th Month, 1683. about the 40th. year of his age.
AS for our Friend and Brother, who is taken hence before us, I have this to
say of him, That ever since I knew him, being about fourteen years past (since
I came to live in Dublin) I was sensible his Love and Reality was so much to
the blessed Truth he professed, as to prefer it before any man or thing he was
concerned in: For he loved the Honor of the Lord and his pure Truth, which
never consented to any sin or evil, which caused me to have a very near love to
(and unity with) him. He stood a faithful Witness in his day (according to his
Call and Measure) against Deceit in Professor and Prosane, yet a great Lover of
the faithful, and desirer of Unity amongst Brethren. I never perceived him apt
to differ with any about outward things, which he accounted trifles in the
comparison of the heavenly Riches, which I am sensible he much prized, and
loved to see others prosper therein: for my own part, in all my Intimacy with
him, (which was very great) (as I can remember) I always found him zealous for
Truth, his Behavior being sweetened with the Spirit of Truth: he lived and
deceased well, and was in the long and tedious time of his Sickness born up by
the Truth he loved, in much comfort and patience waiting the Lords appointed
time for his Deliverance into eternal Rest. And still his remembrance lives in
my heart, and that he is entered into eternal habitation of Rest, is sealed in
my Spirit; and doubtless it is a good motive and encouragement for the faithful
to persevere in well doing to the end, that the Crown of eternal Life may be
their portion, which is not only laid up for him, but for all the righteous
that love Christ's appearance.

He left his ancient Mother, and five Children (Orphants) behind him, which he
carefully and wisely discharged himself toward, as to his outward estate; and
he having left good Council and Advice to his Children, given forth in
Manuscript in the time of his Sickness, his said Mother desired it should be
put into print, which was unanimously agreed to by Friends of our Men's Meeting
in Dublin, for the Service of them intended, and others that may reap benefit
thereby.

The Righteous are taken away from the evil to come, and few lay it to heart.

And though the Lord has taken so servicable a Member from us; yet he can raise
up more (and I hope will) whereby his Name and Truth may be honored upon the
Earth, not unto us, not unto us, but unto the Name and Power of the Lord, over
all, be Praises, and Renown, who is worthy for ever and ever. Amen.

Honest Joseph. I loved him very dear;
For to the Lord of Life he had true fear:
His Truth he loved, and all the Righteous Seed;
But fallers back did make his heart to bleed
In sorrowful dolor for the Truths renown,
That such backsliders had defaced its Crown
Within themselves, which made the weak to stumble,
Against such blocks the blind's apt to tumble.
He loved the blind should not be led astray,
And erring folks be brought to the right way.
He loved the Light, and brightness of its ray,
That shined in his Soul of its clear day.
His Understanding and his Love thereby
To God and man, was good entirely,
That God his Honor, and that man true Peace
He did desire to his very Race;
But such as of this happiness did bereave
Just was his Sorrows, and's Judgments grave,
To bring them to a sense of their own state,
TO amend their ways before it was to late:
His Zeal was well intended for their well,
And's Love to God, against whom they did rebel.
But he is gone to that eternal Bliss
Of never ending Joys, and so to cease
From man, who is breath's so short that they
In little time shall have no more a day.
His care for Truth, and for such souls as these
Was very great, that they might have true peace:
And that Gods Name might ever honored be,
And all the saving Truth might love like he:
His holy Zeal, his virtuous Spirit so clean
Does speak aloud what he therein did mean;
Though fallers back by his zeal has bin crossed,
He did desire not one soul should be lost.
This is my Testimony of his mind,
Which by a strict scrutiny I find:
Though he with evil actors could not bear,
Yet against the Truth to act he had great fear.
His Body's gone, yet Praise is left behind;
So young, and real for Truth, I desire to find
More Joseph's bough, over the wall to spread,
And to the wicked be as great a dread;
His Counsel to's Babes does partly show,
That of his Spirit I write, that I did know,
And that for all, that are now left behind,
That with his Zeal for Truth any fault may find,
I do desire for them, and all men's parts,
They may live and dye and have deserts
Like him I do through Truth so much commend,
Who to the truth and mankind was a friend
So or the Truth we Self must come to hate,
That hinders us from a more happy state,
To love and live in truth through all our days
By me and all Truths lovers be the praise.
A S.
