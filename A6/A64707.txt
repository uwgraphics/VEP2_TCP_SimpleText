THE UNFORTUNATE Fortunate Marry'd-Man.
JACK met his Friend Dick, and some Compliments past,
He said, by the by, he had married at last.
That Is well, quoth his Friend, -- No not so well neither,
For none but the Devilish could link us together;
Her Tongue, without ceasing, by Night or by Day,
As loud as a Tempest, as rough as the Sea!
Poor Jack I lament thee, so hard is thy Fate!
No, not so hard neither, -- I got with my Kate
A Brace of good Thousands; and thus Men of Skill,
By gilding, can swallow the bitterest Pill
Then Matters are better by far than I thought.
No, Sir, -- When you hear of the Bargain I bought,
I laid it all out in some Sheep, like a Sot;
And they all took the Scab, and they died of the Rot.
Alas, I lament thee, -- For better for worse!
Thy Wife and thy Money have both proved thy Curse.
No, not so bad neither; I made up what is lost:
For I got for the Skins quite as much as they cost.
O ho did you so, -- then your Losses are easy.
And were your dear Katy but so, how 'twould please ye!
No, not quite so easy, two Thousand good Pound,
I gave for a House, which is burned to the Ground.
Then Dick I lament thee, you are ruined for Life.
No, not so bad neither, -- It burned my Wife.
