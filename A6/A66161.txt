His Majesty's MOST GRACIOUS SPEECH To both HOUSES of PARLIAMENT.
My Lords and Gentlemen,
I Am Resolved to leave nothing unattempted on My Part, which may contribute to
the Peace and Prosperity of this Nation; And finding My Presence in Ireland
will be absolutely necessary for the more speedy Reducing of that Kingdom, I
continue My Resolution of going thither as soon as may be; And I have now
Called you together for your Assistance, to Enable Me to Prosecute the War with
Speed and Vigor: In which I Assure My Self of your cheerful Concurrence, being
a Work so necessary for your own Safeties.

In Order to this, I desire you will forthwith make a Settlement of the
Revenue; and I cannot doubt, but you will therein have as much Regard for the
Honor and Dignity of the Monarchy in My Hands, as has been lately showed to
others: And I have so great a Confidence in you, That if no Quicker on more
Convenient way can be found for the Raising of Ready Money (without which the
Service cannot be performed) I shall be very well Content, for the present, to
have it made such a Fond of Credit as may be Useful to your selves as well as
Me, in this Conjuncture, not having the least Apprehensions, but that you will
provide for the taking off all such Anticipations as it shall happen to fall
under.

It is sufficiently known how Earnestly I have Endeavored to Extinguish (or at
least Compose) all Differences amongst My Subjects, and to that End, how often
I have Recommended an Act of Indemnity to the last Parliament; But since that
Part of it which related to the Preventing of Private Suits is already Enacted,
and because Debates of that Nature, must take up more of your Time then can now
be spared from the Dispatch of those other Things, which are absolutely
necessary for Our Common Safety, I intend to send you an Act of Grace, with
Exceptions of some few Persons only, but such as may be sufficient to show My
great Dislike of their Crimes, and at the same time My Readiness to extend
Protection to all My other Subjects, who will thereby see, that they can
Recommend themselves to Me by no other Methods then what the Laws Prescribe,
which shall always be the only Rules of My Government.

A further Reason which induces Me to send you this Act at this time, is,
Because I am desirous to leave no Color of Excuse to any of My subjects for
the Raising of Disturbances in the Government, and especially in the time of My
Absence: And I say this, both to Inform you, and to let some Ill Affected Men
see, That I am not unacquainted how busy they are in their present Endeavors
to Alter it.

Amongst other Encouragements which I find they give themselves, one of the
Ways by which they hope to Compass their Designs, is, By creating Differences
and Disagreements in your Counsels, which I hope you will be very Careful to
Prevent; For be assured, That Our greatest Enemies can have no better
Instruments for their Purposes, then those who shall any way endeavor to
Disturb or Delay your Speedy and Unanimous Proceeding upon these necessary
Matters.

I must Recommend also to your Consideration an Union with Scotland; I do not
mean it should now be entered upon, but they having Proposed this to Me some
time since, and the Parliament there having Nominated Commissioners for that
purpose, I should be glad that Commissioners might also be Nominated here to
Treat with them, and to see if such Terms could be Agreed on, as might be for
the Benefit of both Nations, so as to be ready to be Presented to you in some
future Session.

My Lords and Gentlemen,

I have thought it most convenient to leave the Administration of the
Government in the Hands of the QUEEN during My Absence; And if it shall be
judged necessary to have an Act of Parliament for the better Confirmation of it
to Her, I Desire you will let such an one be prepared to be Presented to Me.

I have this only to add, That the Season of the Year, and My Journey into
Ireland, will admit but of a very short Session; so that I must Recommend to
you the making such Dispatch, that We may not be Engaged in Debates when Our
Enemies shall be in the Field: for the Success of the War, and the more Thrifty
Management of it, will both principally depend upon your speedy Resolutions.
And I hope it will not be long before We shall Meet again, to perfect what the
Time will not now allow to be done.

FINIS.
