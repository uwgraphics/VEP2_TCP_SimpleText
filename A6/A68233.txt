The determinacion of the university of Orleaunce.
NOt long syns there were put forth unto us the college of doctors regentes
of the university of Orlea^ce, these.ij. questions, that follow. The first,
whether it be leful by the law of god for the brother to take to wife that
woman / whom his brother has left. The second, and if this be forbidden by
the law of god / whether this prohibition of the law of god may be remytted
by the pope his dispensation* we the forsaid college of doctors regentes
according to our custom and usage / came many times to gether, and did sit
diverse times upon the discussinge of these forsaid doubts and questiones, and
did examine and wey, as much as we might, diverse and many places both of the
old testament and the new, and also the interpreters and declarers both of
the law of god and of the canon law. And when we had weyed and considered all
things exactly and with good leyser and deliberation, we have determined and
concluded / that these forsaid marriages can not be attempted nor enterprised /
except a man do wrong and plain contrary to the law of god: yea and that all
though it be done by the pardon and sufferaunce of the pope. And in witness of
this conclusion and determination / we have caused this present public
writynge to be sygned by our scribe of our said university / and to be
strengthed and fortified with the seal of the same. Inacted in the chapel of
our blessed lady of the annuntiation / or of the good tidinges / that she had
of Christis coming / in Orleance, the year of our lord.1529. the.5. day of
April.

The determinacio^ of the faculte of the decrees of the university of Paris.
IN the name of our lord. so be it. There was put forth before us, the Deane
and college of the right counseilfull faculte of decrees of the university of
Paris this question, whether the Pope might dyspense, that the brother might
mary the wife / that his brother had left, if marriage between his brother now
deed and his wife were ones consummate. we, the dean and College of the
forsaide faculty, after many disputacions and reasons made of both sides upon
this matter, and after great and long tournynge and searching of books both
of the law of god and of the popes law / and of the law Civil: we counsel
and sey / that the pope has no power to dispense in this foresaid case. In
witness whereof we have caused this present wrytinge to be strengthed with the
seal of our faculty / and with the sign of our scribe our chief bydell.
Given in our congregation or assemble at saint John^ Lateranense in Paris /
the.25. day of May / the year of our lord.1530.

The determination of these.ii. facultes / that is / of the Popes law / and
the Civil law / of the university of Angewe.
NOt long time sins there were proposed unto us, the Rector and doctors
regentes in law Canon and Civil of the university of Angewe, these two
questions here following. That is to wit, whether it is unlawful by the law
of god, and the law of nature, for a man to mary the wife / that is left of
his brother and that departed without childerne, but so that the marriage was
co^summate. And again / whether it is leful for the Pope to dispense in such
marriage. we the fore said Rector and doctors have, according to our custom
and usage, many times commen to gether / and sytten to dispute these questions,
and to find out certainly the treuth of them. And after that we had discussed
and examyned many and diverse places, as well of the law of god, as of the law
of man / which seem to perteyne to the same purpose: and after that we had
brought many reasons for both parties / and examined them: all things
feythfully, and after good conscience considered, and upon sufficient
deliberation and auisement taken: we define and determine / that another by the
law of god / nor of nature / it is permitted for any Christen man / no not
euin with the auctorite of the seat apostolyke, or with any dyspensation
granted by the pope / to mary the wife / that his brother had left / all
though his brother be departed without children, after that marriage is ones
fynisshed and consu^mate. And for witness of all these forsaide things / we
have commanded our scribe of our fore said vniuersyte to sign this present
public instrument / and it to be fortified by the greatte seal of our said
university. Inacted in the church of saint Peter in Angewe by our college /
the year of our lord.1530. the.7. day of May.

The determination of the faculty of divinity of the university of Paris.
THe Deane and the faculty of the holy divinity of the university of Paris
to all them / unto whom this p^sent wryti^g shall come / wyssheth safety in our
savior Christ / which is the very true safety. where of late there is
risen a controversy of great difficulty upon the marriage between the most
noble Henry the.viij. king of England / defendour of the faith / and lord
of Irelande. etc. and the most noble lady Catharine / queen of England /
daughter of the Catholic king Ferdinande, which marriage was not only
contracte between her and her former husband / but also consummate and
finysshed by carnal intermedlynge, this question also was proposed us to
discuss and examine according to Justice and treuth / that is to say /
whether that to marie her / that our brother dead without children had left
/ be so prohibit by the law of god and of Nature / that hit can not be made
lefull by the popes dispensations / that any christian man should marye the
wife, that his brother has left. we, the foresaid deane and faculty
calling unto our remembrance how virtuous and how holy a thing and how
agreeable unto our profession, unto our duty of love and charity / hit is for
us to show the way of Justice and right, of virtue and honesty to them /
which desire to lead and pass over their life in the law of our lord with
sicker and quiet conscience: would not but be ready to satisfy so just and
honest requests. whereupon after our old wont, we came to gether upon our
oath in the church of saint Maturin / and there for the same thing had a
solemn mass with devout prayer to the holy ghost / and also we took an oath
every man to deliver and to study upon the foresaid question, as should be to
the pleasure of god / and accorgynge to conscience. And after diverse and many
sessions or syttynges, which were had and continued in the church of saint
Maturin, and also in the college called Sorbone, from the viii. day of June to
the second day of July / when we had serched and examined throw and throw,
with as much dilygence as we could, and with such reverence and religion or
conscience as becomes in such a matter, both the books of holy scripture,
and also the most approved interpreters of the same, finally the general and
synodall councelles, decrees / and constitucions of the sacre holy church /
which by long usage and custom have been resseyued and approbate: we the
foresaid Dean and faculte, disputinge upon the fore said question, and
making answer to the same: and that after the judgment and full consent of
the most part of the faculty, have concluded and determined, that the
foresaid marriage with brothers wives, departing without children, be so
forbidden, both by the law of god / and of nature, that the pope has no
power to dyspense with such maryages, whether they be co^tracte, or to be
co^tracte. And for credence and believe and witness of this our assertion and
determination, we have caused the seal of our faculty, with our notaris sign
to be put unto this present writing. Dated in our general congregation, that
we kept by an oath at saint Maturins, the year of our lord.1530. the second
day of July

The determinacion of the university of Biturs.
We the Dean and faculty of divinity in the vniuersyte of Biturs / because we
will according to the ensample of Paul the doctor of the gentiles / which
does like wise in many places / will begin our writynge with prayer / unto all the beloved of god / among whom you most dear reders / unto who^ we write, be
called / grace and peace and quietness of conscience come unto you from god
the father / and from our lord Jesus Christ. with in the octaues of
whytsontyde / while we were gethered to gether all into one place both in body
and mind, and were sytting in the house of the foresaid Dean, there was a
question put unto us again, which had been proposed unto us often times before,
being no small question, which was this: whether the brother taking the wife
of his brother now deed, and the marriage ones consummate and perfect, does a
thing, that is unlawful, or no. At the last when we had sought for the treuth
of the thing, and had perceived and found it out by much labor and study
of every one of us by him self, and by much and often turninge of holy books
/ every one of us not corrupt, whereby we might the less have obeyed the
treuth, began as the holy ghost did put in his mind, to give every man one
arbiterment and sentence, which was this: I have well perceived in very truth
with out regard or respect of any person, that those persons / which be
rehearsed in the.xviii. chaptre of the Leuiticall / be forbidden by the very
law of nature to contracte matrimony to gether, and that this law can in no
wise be released by any auctorite of any man: by the which there is made an
abhomynable discovering of the brothers foulnes. And this is the sign of our
comen bedyl and notary, and the seal of our foresaid faculty put unto this
present writynge the.x. day of June, the year from the birth of Christ.1530.
And by cause the foot of our writing shall be of one form or fasshion with
the heed, as we began with prayer / so let us end, after the example of Paul
that we spoke of before, and sey: The grace and favor of our lord Jesus
Christ / the charity and love of god, and the communication of the holy ghost
be with you al. Amen.

The determination of the faculty of divinity of the university of Bononye.
GOd best, and myghtiest, taught first the old law or testament with his
own mouth / to form and fasshyon according to love and charity the manners
and life of men. And second the same self god did take afterward manhood
upon him, for to be the redemer of man: and so made the new law or new
testament, not only to form and fasshion according to love and charity, the
life and the manners of men / but also to take away and to declare doubts / the
which did arise in many cases: which when they be ones clearly determined /
shall help greatly to pfecte virtue and goodness / that is to say / to perfect
love and charity. wherefore we thought it evermore / that it should be our part
/ to follow these most holy doctrines and laws of our father of heaven / and
that we lyghtned by the light of god above / and of the holy gooste, should
give our sentence and judgment in high and doutfull matters / after that we
have ones leyserly and sufficiently taken aduisement upon the cause, and have
clearly serched out and opened the thing by many reasons and writings of holy
fathers / as well for the one part as for the the other / doing nothing as nighe
as we can rasshely or without deliberation. Therefore where as certain great
and noble men did insta^tly desire us / that we would with all diligence
possible look for this case / that hereafter insueth: and afterward to give
our judgment upon the same / according to most equite right and conscience /
sticking only to the truth / all the doctors of divinity of this university
/ when we had every one by him self examined the matter before at home in our
houses, came all to gether in to one place / and there treated upon hit many
days / with as much counnynge and learning as we could: we anon looked upon
the case to gether / we examyned hit to gether / we compared all thing to
gether: we handlynge thoroughly every thing by it self / did try them even
as you would say / by line and rule: we brought forth all manner of reasons /
which we thought could be brought for the contrary part / and afterward
solued them. ye even the resones of the most reverend father Cardinal
Caietaine, yea more over the Deuteronomi dispensation of styrring up the
brothers sede, and shortly all other manner of reasons and opinions of the
contrary party, as many as seemed to belong to this purpose. And this
question / that was asked of us was this / whether hit was forbidden only by
the ordinance of the church / or else by the law of god / that a man might
not marye the wife left of his brother: departed without children. And if it
were commanded by both the.ij. laws not to be done, whether the pope may
dispense with any man to make such marriage? the which question now that we
have examined it both by our self secretly, and also openly as dyligently
and exactly as we could possible, and discussed it after the best manner that
our wit would serve, we determine / we give judgment, we sey, and as stiffly
as we can we witness / and without any doubt / do steadfastly hold / that this
marriage should be horrible / accursed / to be cried out upon / and utterly
abominable, not only for a christen man / but also for any infidel /
vnfeythful, or hethen. And that it is prohibit under grievous peynes and
punysshementes by the law of god of nature and of man / and that the pope /
though that he almost may do all things / unto whom Christ did give the
keys of the kingdom of heaven / has no power to give a dispensation to any
man for to contracte such a marriage for any manner of cause consideration or
suggestion. And all we be redye at all times and in all places to deende and
maynteine the treuth of this our conclusion. In witness whereof we have made
this present writing, and have fortified the same both with the seal of our
university, and also with the seal of the college of the doctors of
divinity, and have subscribed and signed it with our general and accustomed
subscription. In the cathedral church of Bonony the.10. day of June / the
year of our lord 1530. under the popeshyppe of Clemente the* eight.

The determination of the faculte of divinity of the university of Padway in
Italy.
THey / that have written for the mayntenaunce of the catholic feyth / affirm
that god best and mightiest did give the precepts and co^mandementes of the
old law with his own mouth, to be an exampler for us / wherein we might se
bow we should order our life and our manners / and this god had done before he
became man. And after that he had put upon him our manhood / and was become
redemer or byer of mankind / he made the new law or testament / and of his
mere liberality did give it us not only for the cause beforesayd, but also to
take away and declare al manner of doutes and questions / that might arise /
the which ones opened and declared what their very true meaning is / to the
intent that thereby we might be made perfectly good / be greatly fruitful unto
us and wholesome / and saying that this was the mind of god in making these
laws / it has been our intent / and evermore shall be, as it becomes christen
men / to follow these most solemn ordinances of the most high work master
god / and by the help of light, that is above the capacite of nature, to utter
our judgment in all manner of doutes and hard questions. After that we had ones
considered the thing after the best manner, and had by suffycient leyser made
it clear by many evident reasons of both parties, and by many auctorites of
fathers of the church, determinynge no thing, as nere as we can, rasshely or
with out convenient deliberation: seeing therefore that certain great orators
or ambassadors did humbly pray us / that we would wytsaue to search out /
with all the diligence that we could / this case following: and afterward to
give our sentence upon the same, plainly and symply loking upon the only
treuth / all the doctors of divinity of this university came to geder after
that we had every man examined the thing particularly at home in our own
houses, and have beaten it out with all learning and counnyng that we were able
/ anon, when we were to gether, we cosydered, examyned, and weyed all things
by them self, and brought in all manner of reasons / which we thought might
in any means be made to the contrary / and without all color or cloak did
holly and clearly dissolve them, and take them away: and amongst al, even the
dispensation by the law of the deuteronomi of styrrynge up the brothers sede,
and all manner other reasons and determinations to the contrary, that seemed to
us to perteyne any thing to the purpose / we utterly confuted and dispatched
them. And the question, that was put unto us is this. whether that to marye the
wife of our brother departed without children, is forbidden only by the law of
the church, or by the law of god also: and if it be forbidden by both the.ij.
lawis / wheder the pope may dispe^ce with any man for such matrimony or no.
which question now that we have discussed it / and as far as we could,
have made it clear / both privately every man by him self / and all to
gethers openly / we say / judge, decree / witness, and for a treuth affirm /
that such marriage is no marriage: yea that hit is to be abhorred and cursed of
every christen man / and to be abhomynate as a grievous sin / and that it is
as clearly as can be forbidden under most crudell penalties by the law of
nature, of god, and of man. And that the Pope, unto whom the keys of the
kingdom of heaven be committed by Christ, the son of god, has no power to
dispense by right and law for any cause or suggestion, or excuse / that any
such matrimony should be contracte. for tho things / which be forbidden by
the law of god / be not underneath his power / but above hit / nor he is not
the vicar of god / as concerning tho things / but only in such things / as
god has not determined him self in his law / but has left them to the
determination and ordinance of man. And to maintain the truth of this our
sentence and conclusion / and for most certain / and undoubted defense of the
same, we all of one mind and accord, shall at all times and in every place
be redye. In witness whereof we have made this writing, and have auctorised it
with the accustomed seal of our vnyuersitie, and also of our college of
divines. Dated at Padway in the church of the hermites of saint Austen the.1.
day of July an. 1530.

The determination of the university of Tolose.
There was treated in our university of Tolose a very hard question, whether it
is leful for the brother to mary her, which had been wife unto his brother now
departed, and that without childerne. There was be side this, a another thing /
that troubles us very sore, whether, if the Pope, which has cure of Christ's
flock, would by his dispe^satio^, as men call it, suffer this: that tha^ at the
leest wise it might be lefull. The Rector of the university called to counsel
all the doctors regentes, that were that time at Tolose, for to show their
minds upon this question / and that not ones but twyse: for he iuged / that
counsel gyuynge ought not to be hasted / nor done upon heed, and that we had
need of time and space to do any thing conveniently, and as it ought. At the
last there came to gether in to one place all the best learned and counningest
doctors / both of holy dyuinite, and also doctors, that were most best learned
in both laws, yea and finally as many as had any experience in any matter,
and were able to do any thing other by judgment and discretion / or by
eloquence, or by their excellent wits: and did swear, that they would obey
the sacre holy counsels, and would follow the decrees of the fathers, which no
man, that has any good conscience / will violate or break / and so every man
said his mind / and the matter was debated and resoned diffusely and at large
for both parties. In conclusion we fell so fast unto this point, that this was
the sentence and determination, that our university / with one voice of all /
did determine and conclude, with most pure and clear conscience, and defiled
with no manner of leven or corruption: that it is lefull for no man, another by
the law of god nor yet by the law of nature, to take her to wife, that his
brother has left. And saying that it may not be done by the law of god, nor
of nature, we answered al / that the Pope can not lose no man fro that law /
nor dispense with him. And as for that thing can not be contrary to our
sentence and verdicte, that the brother in old time was compelled by the law
of the Deuteronomi to mary the brothers wife departed without issue. For this
law was but a figure and a shadow of things to come, which vanisshed a wey,
as soon as ever the light and treuthe of the gosspell apered. And because
these things be thus, we have given our sentence after this form above, and
have commanded that same to be signed by our notarie, which is our
secretary, and to be fortified and auctorised by the putting to of our
autenticall seal of our university aforesaid. At Tolose the calendes or first
day of Octobre / the year from the birthe of Christ.1530.

The preface to the reder.
Gentle indifferent reder thou have here before the determinations and decrees
/ which the most famous and most noble universities of al christendom have
with great consent, great judgment, and discretion, with great faith fulness /
and without any corruption, with great regard / clerenes / and discharge of
conscience made / and by their authority confirmed upon those leuitical laws:
by the which it is forbidden / that any man should marie the wife of his
brother departed without children / and we doubt not / but these decrees and
determinations ought of right and good reason to be believed / both of the and
also of all other / that be men of wisdom and discretion: and that be
nothing affectionate / but indifferent. For such men will be well content
and satisfied alonely with the very truth it self / all though it be not
fortified with any witness, nor set forth with pomp and plenty of
reasons: so that such men would nothing doubt / but that thing ought to be
judged as certain and true / as possible may be / the which so many of the
most absolute / and most wise, and most best seen men in all kind of
learning have serched / beaten out / trased out, and in conclusion decreed and
determined, with so great gravity and sobre manner / with so great study and
diligence / and with such leysour and deliberation. But parauenture there be
some / the which will little be moved from their opinion / that they have
ones taken / for all those decrees and verdites of so great learned and wysemen
/ and for all the agreement and authority of so many and so excellent
universities / but will think / that hit is necessary to enter higher and
deper yet into the knowledge of the treuth / and will not ground and stablysshe
their believe but even upon the foundacions and grounds of very truth self /
which they them self have spyed and clearly perceived / and not upon other
men's sentences and judgments. Therefore we have judged / that we should do a
thing worth our labor / if we did gather in to one small book certain
reasons and auctorities / by the which it might be plainly and openly declared
/ that there were very weighty and ryghtfull reasons / which were able to
bring so many learned men into this true opinion. And in doing our diligence in
this matter / hit seemed to us convenient to follow, as a certain rule and line
/ not only the auctorities of holy scripture / of holy cou^sailes and canons,
and also of the most approved and resceyued doctors of the church: but also
the witness of reason and nature / and to set before men's eyes / as far as
scripture or reason, or fynallye nature seemed us to help, for the declaration
and confirmation of the judgment and mind of these foresaid learned men. And
if so be it gentil reder / these things, that we shall sey, shall not fully
satisfye thy marvelous exact judgment, and shall be seen not to be greatly
necessary, and to prove but smally this matter, that we go about: there
shall be no cause for all that, why thou should esteem the most weighty
determination, and most high wisdom and learning of these vniuersyties, by
our power and small learning: but shalt for thy natural gentilnes pardon our
weakness and sklendernesse of wit and learning, the which was not able to
do no better / and shalt look for more weightye and piththie reasons of the
vnyuersyties selves / which reasons as these universities have them in a
redynes and at hand, so we doubt not, but of their humanity and gentilnes
they will gladly show them to every man, that will desire them / and also
shortly put them out openly to all the world. In the mean season, gentill
indefferente reder, take in good worth our study / and faithful diligence,
and this our labor and enterprise, and look over these wrytinges (such as
they be) gladly and indyfferently. And let it not be paynfull unto the good
reder / if we tarry in any place in this work somewhat long: for both the
diffycultie and hardness of this thing, and the manner of our intent and
purpose does necessarely require, that we should touch each one thing
somewhat depely even from the head and very fountain and beginning of hit. And
farthermore, that we should declare and open all things some what at large and
plentyfully, and that specially in the fyfte chaptre of this book, whereby both
the treuthe, plainly showed, may the more clearly be seen, and the error,
and false opynion of them, that be of the contrary side, may be the more
easily perceived. And saying, that this verdyte and judgment of the
Vnyuersytyes conteyneth chieffely two things / the which, as ye would say /
be the high points and heedes or issues of this determynation: The first,
that hit is forbidden, both by the law of god / and also by the law of nature
/ that any christen man should marie the wife of his brother dyeng with out
children. The second / that the Pope has not power to dispense upon any such
marriages / whether they be contracte allredy / orels yet to be contracte. It
lyked us here first and formoste to look upon the law of god / that we might
clearly se the glorious bryghtnes of the treuthe of our lord. For trewly who
so ever will diligently look with such eyes / as he ought upon the law of
god / puttyng of clean the coueryng of his flesh and bloudde / with the
desires, affections, and lusts of the same / by the which a man is blinded,
that he can not se the trewthe of god / he shall without doubt understand /
what things be of god, what things be of Christ, and what things be of the
spirit or ghost. For truly the same law does perfectely teach / what
things so ever belong to the fear and dread of god, what to the evermore
enduring treuth / what to the everlasting justice of god / what to the power
and virtue of god / what to the grace and favor and to the free benefits of
god / what to feyth, believe, and trust / what to knowlegynge of sin / what
to holiness / what to perfection / to rightnes / to equity and conscience /
to love and charity / breuely / what things before god are taken for clean
or unclean / fyled or vnfiled / comely and acceptable / abominable and cursed
/ holy and unholy. All these things teaches the said law of god. And the
history of Moses (concerning the sacrament of matrimony) is after this manner
and form following.

The first chaptre.
GOd that is best and almighty / after that he by his power / which can in no
wise be expressed / had made heaven and earth, and all things, that be
contained within the compass of the same, and at the last had made Adam also
/ he saw according to his incredible knowledge and wisdom / that it was not
convenient, nor yet good, that Adam should lead his life in Paradyse solitary
and all alone without company / and destitute of all help and comfort. for
god made him naturally to live in amity and friendship / in love and good will
/ and had graven now already in his soul / with his finger of the holy ghost
/ certain general under standynges / perceyuynges / and knowleges / the
which should not only move and stir him to the love of god and man / to
amity and frendeshyppe / and to other duties / deeds / and offices of virtue:
but also should greatly help and strength him / make him able and of power to
perform and fulfill those same offices of virtue / after such manner as they
ought to be done. Therefore god / soon after he had made Adam / cast him in a
deed sleep / and took out one of his rybbes of his side / and made it a woman.
And wha^ he had brought her unto Ada^ / and had coupled them straightly to
gethers, by the bo^de and knot of marriage / by and by he made the laws of
marriage / saying by the mouth of Ada^, Now this bone of my bones and flesh
of my flesh. For the which cause a man shall leave his father and mother / and
shall stycke unto his wife: and they shall be two in one flesh or body / or
two shall be made one flesh or body. But the devil having envy at their
felicity / by and by came upon them by subtlety and such craft / as can not
be told / and did not cease till he had allured them into the snare of sin.
And therefore they were owtlawed and dreuen forth of Paradyse / and were
compelled to till and labor the earth. There when they had applied them self
to bring forth children, and now by process of time the multitude of men was
increased unto an infinite noumbre: god seeing / that much was the malice and
vice of men in the earth, and that all the thought and mind of the heart of man was set and bent evermore and at all times to noughtynesse and sin,
in so much that they took them wives at adventures, whom so ever they had
chosen / sparynge or forbearynge no manner degree of affinity or kynred: our
lord repenting him self / that he had made man, brought in the waters and
Noes fludde upon the earth / and slew all the flesh / in the which was the
spirit of life under heaven / except those few, whom he commanded to go in
to the arc or ship of Noe, the which few when after the drownynge of the
world / they were called out of the ship abroad, that is to wit, when that
our lord was atone again with mankind, he gyuyng his blessing to Noe and his
children / when he was about to publisshe unto them again the laws of
marriage: First and before all things he commanded them to do their duty in
marriage, and to increase and multiply / and fyl full the earth. But after this
when certain hundredes of years were paste, and now the children of Israel,
after their departing out of Egypt (where they had dwelled of a long time)
had been in the wilderness.lx. days more or less / and had pyght their tents
ageynste the mount of Oreb, and there our lord had showed unto Moses, with
wonderful religion and fearefulnes, not only the commandments and
judgments / the which he would to be given to his people: but also had
instruct him at large of the building of the tabernacle / and of the
ornaments of the same, of sacrifice doing, and of bole bourned sacrifice /
and of the place and time of the same / of the prestes of the kynred of Leui /
of the difference of meats / of the clensynges of leprijs / and of other
mistycal things: in the which outwardly appeared a shadow of feythe / and of
good manners / not the very thing in deed: our lord called Moses unto him
again out of the tabernacle of witness or promise / and by cause that the
time was even at hand, for the people of Israhell to enter into the land,
that god had promised them, he commanded Moses ageyn / that by his word and
commandment he should admonysshe the people of new / of keeping the moralle
precepts / and that perteyne to good manners / and to the orderyng and well
rulinge of their life / and that he should make them plain and open unto them /
after the most largest and playnest manner that he could. Therefore by cause,
that god did study / and did care before al things / that his people / whom he
had chosen for his own propre flock / should with such chastity and pure
holiness / as becomes / keep their matrimony / the which is in honor and
reverence amongst al folks: And because they should keep their beds
unspotted and undefiled / nor should not pollute them self with such manner of
marriages, as he had abhorred and had in abhominacion now of long time
amongst the hethens / and had ryghtfully be reue^ged upon them by most
grievous punysshementes, because they were vncharytable / incest / and a cursed
/ our lord commanded Moses, that he should prescribe unto his people / laws
of matrimoni, that should be comfortable and agreing with honesty and
shamefastnes natural / and that he should utterly forbydde such maryages /
which had foulenes and dishonestie in them. And therefore our lord used these
words unto Moses / in the.xviij. chaptre of the Leuiticall / saying: O Moses
/ speak unto the children of Israhell / speak and tell them / not thy word /
nor thy commandment / but mine. For I my self / their very lord and god /
do teache them this / and this command them / that they live another after the
abhomynable custom of the Egiptiens / from whose miserable bondage I have
delivered them into perfect and full liberty, by my valiant arm and myghtie
power: nor yet after the ungracious vsages, and manners of the Cananees / whose
land I will give unto them / and will bring them into it* but that they from
hensforth observe and keep my commandments / my judgments / and my laws,
and that they follow them, and live after them. For beside other myscheuous
vices / this thing also is leful and customable among those hethens / to
myngle or marye them self by most shameful lust and pleasure of their bodies
with women / that be most nyest of their blood / and of their affinity /
putting no difference between them and other women. Therefore I will have my
people to be very far from their manners and conditions. And therefore I mine
own self, their very lord and god, say unto them, and co^mande them / that
no man so hardy to come nigh any woman / that is nere of his blood / for to
discover her foulenes or shame, as to his own mother, to his step mother, to
his sister, to his nece / to his aunte or fathers sister / to his mothers
sister, to the daughter of his son in law, to the daughter of his daughter in
law, or to his wives sister. Also no man shall take the wife of his brother,
and no man shall discover the foulenes of his brothers wife, because it is the
foulenes of his brother. For who so marieth his brothers wife / does a thing
/ that is unlawful, he shall be without sons or heirs male. Therefore let
not my people be polluted with none of these things, with which all the
hethyns be defiled / whom I shall cast out before their faces, and with whom
that land is polluted / and I shall visit and look on the mischeuous sins of
that land / that it shall vomette and spewe forth the inhabitants of hit.
Let them keep my laws, and my iugementes / and se they do none of all these
abhominacions, whether he be of the country borne, or a till man / that is a
stranger among them. For the dwellers of this land / which were in hit
before them / and have polluted hit / have done all those cursed things.
Therefore let them beware / lest that when they have done like thingis, the
land vomet and spewe them out / likewise as it has vomet and spewed out the
nation / that was there before them. For every soul, that shall do any of
these abominations / shall perisshe from the mids of my people, nor shall not
be rekened amongst my holy people. And trewly hitherto we have showed you / by
a certain breue exposition / and that only upon the feythe and credence of the
most approved doctors, that be / and also as shortly as we could / almost
all that ever is prescribed and commanded in the old testament, by the mouth
of god him self, upon the beginning and first ordyna^ce of maryages / and of
the laws thereof / and more over upon the impedymentes or lettes of marriage /
by the mean of kynrede and affinity / the which have place at this day.
whereby it may easily be perceived, that such an impedyment of marriage is
expressly found in the holy scripture / where by persons be made unlawful to
contracte matrimony / that is to say / the impediment by nerenesse of bloudde,
as Moses called hit: by the which we understand both them / that be of
kynred, and them that be of affinity also, and that not generally in all
kynsfolke / but specially in those degrees and persons, which both we have
rehearsed / and they be expressly rekned up in the foresaid.xviij. chaptre of
the Leuiticall. And by the same foresaid things a man may also well se, that
no man can pretend any color or cloak / or find any manner of cauillation,
whereby that man, which has married his brothers wife, should not be iuged of
all the holle people, not only to have contemned and despised god, the which
has with so great majesty commanded the contrary, but also to have offended
by infectynge and corruptinge the manners of the people, by such a mischiuous
example, to have done against the laws of nature, and also to have broken
foully and ungodly, the ryghtes and holy keeping of shamefastnes and marriage,
finally to have hyndred universally the propagacion and increasynge of love and
charity between christen people. For who so ever will consider aryghte, and
according to reason, the order, the strength, and virtue of these laws / and
also the wise intent and reason of the making of them: he shall sone perceive,
how true it is, that we have seyde. And first of al consider / how greatly
these laws of matrimoni do help for the maynteininge and exercise of virtue,
of chastity, of clennes, of holiness, and purity of marriage, of natural
demurenes, shamefacidnes, and reverence, that ought to be between kynsfolke,
specially in marriage, of propagacion or increasement of love and charity, and
finally of diverse other duties, offices, and deeds of virtue, which both of
them self be honest and good / and besides forth be necessary also to the
purchasing and obteining of everlasting felicity. Ageyn ponder, how god, most
of power, and most best, does exhort in a manner by certain obtestations or
affectuous / and hearty desiringes and prayenges, not only the Iues / but also
the strangers / that live after Moses law / to perform and fulfill these
foresaid laws, not only for his benefits and goodness, that they have had,
and should have of him, but also for his own auctorite and majesty, which is
most great, and in no wise to be disobeyed. Over and beside all this consider,
with how great strength and weyghte of words, and with how great care and
thought god, in decreenge these laws / does often rehearse / saying* It is not
for a man, it is foulenes, it is mischeuousnes, it is cursidnes / it is
abomination, it is not to be spoken, it is not lefull / it is against the very
laws of god / breuely hit is filthy and sklaunderous / that any man should do
any such thing* Last of all and for a conclusion consider, what and how
grievous punysshementes god does threten them with, when he does require of
them the keeping of this laws: ye and more over, how sore he has taken
vengeance, and has punysshed the hethens, by cause they had contracte cursed
marriages within these degres, and that before this law was made. And he does
threten also like, and not a whitte less punisshementes, unto the Iues / and
hethins / that profess the Iues law / if at any time they did commit like
enormities. Forsooth if any man will wey well / and examine these foresaid
things / religiously / and with good conscience / so as they ought to be /
how shall he not straight approve and allow the conclusions and determinations
of those Universities / and to think certaynely, that it is forbidden both by
the law of god / and the law of Nature / that any christen man should take to
wife his brothers wydowe. For seeing that these prohibitions (as we shall here
after more largely declare) were hallowed and founded by god him self upon the
fear of god / upon the treuthe, upon justice / upon holiness, and equite, and
conscience, on feyth, upon perfetnesse and ryghtnes, and on charity / and for
to declare and open the knowledge of our sin / for to declare the knowledge of
the grace and fre goodness of god, for clennes / for comeliness / finally for
good reasonable and holy obedience / or service of god / and such as should be
to our lord god pleasant and acceptable / what man, having pure conscience
in his soul, does not judge such forbidden marriages to be incestuous, foul,
unclean, abominable, and a cursed before god and manne? And what man, ye
though he were governor of all the holle world, if his conscience pricked him
for such incest, will not fear the terrible judgment of god? First / leest
he should provoke and bring upon him self the vengeance of god / as did the
sons of Cain, the which were drowned in Noes floudde, by cause they did
foully abuse their systers and their brothers wives, as approved doctors do
say. Second, lest he should be constrained to flee his country, and his
children / either to be distroyed or disherited, like as the kings of Canaan
were served / and as it came in time paste to the king Iechonias. Finally /
leest that after this life, he fall also into the tourmentes of everlasting
punisshement. For here you se before your eyes the sacre holy laws of god /
here you se the lively prophecyes, and words of exceeding virtue and
strength, the which be more persynge, as Paul says / than any double edged
sword / which ronnethe through, til they have divided the life and the soul
/ and have divided the joints and the mary. which words, seeing they be so
plain and open, that if any man will add and put any thing unto them / it
should be ieopardie, leest he should be reproved, and found false, and a liar
/ according to Salomons saying: Forsothe it becomes a christen heart more to
regard the words and authority of god / which so does forbydde / so has in
abhominacion, so does punysshe and revenge such matrymonie, that is contracte
with the brothers wife / than any manner authority of men, or any felicity of
this world, that should bring a man to so great vice and ungodliness, to so
great dedly remorse, and tearinge a sondre of a man's mind and conscience. For
who does not understand, that we ought rather to obey god than man / and that
hit shall be small proffyte to a man, if he win all the world / and lose
his soul. For if he lose his soul, he leseth his body also. And truly it is
a heavy winning / for the which a man leseth him self: that is to say / his
body and his soul / into everlasting damnacion.

The second Chaptre.
Therefore all though a good and a christen reder / after that he has ones
seen these sayenges of god / can not resonably desire any thing more to move
his conscience / that he should surely believe, that he can not break this
Leuiticall forbyddynges, that a man should not marie his brothers wife, without
grievous sin / and transgression both of the law of god, and of the law of
nature also: we neuerthe less will bring forth also witness of the law of
the gospel, such as shall be thought to help for the clerynge of this
matter, and also we shall show / what the sacre holy counsayles / and the best
learned and most approved doctors of the church have iuged in this matter.
And first of all the authority of saint John^ and saint Paul does maynteine
and confyrme the sentence of these universities. The auctorite of saint Paul,
where as he gives his judgment, that christen men, even at this time / are
bound to keep that other Leuiticall law / that a man should not mary his
stepmother / which law was made and publisshed in the same place / the same
text / by the same sprite / and the same self time, that this other law was /
that a man should not marye his brothers wife. And Paul calls that
vnclenlines or fornication, utterly against Nature, and beastly / that a man
should marie his fathers wife. Ageyn the authority of saint John^ is plain /
where as he openly rebukes Herod the king / saying: It is not leful for the
to have thy brothers wife. For what so ever the interpretation or understanding
of those words is / whether they be understand of his brother being a live or
deed: yet this thing is sure / as it is also seen to great learned men, that
saint John^ did take those words out of the Leuiticall book. And by cause
that those things, which he did say, should have the more auctorytie,
strength, and virtue, he pourposely did rebuke and reprove the shameless and
incest life of Herod, not by his own words, but by the words of god. For it
should have been to no purpose, to have laid any crime to king Herodes
charge for this thing, upon any other cause / saying that Herod was an alien
and an heathen: and therefore was not forbidden by none other law, whereby he
might not marye his brothers wife / ye and though his brother had left.x.
childerne by her. for as the prohibitions of the law Canon they were not that
time made / and the law Deuteronomi did bind the Iues only. wherefore saying
that this (no doubt) most rightful sentence of saint John^ was given against
king Herod an hethen man, generally and without any exception / lymitation /
or distinction / nor hit is not restreined unto the wife of his brother living
/ or of his brother leauyng children, what other thing should we think that
saint Ihon^ did mean? then that this Leuiticall law / that a man should not
marie his brothers wife, does indefferently belong unto all men / as well
hethens as Iues / by cause it is merueilous agreeable with natural reason, and
that all christian men are necessarely bound unto the obseruatyon or keeping of
the same, as well as they be to the keeping of the commandment of god and of
nature? For though we grant / that Moses law was not taken a wey, specially
among them / unto whom the gospel was not yet showed, until such time as
the gospel / and this happy tidinges of Christ was published and openly
declared unto them / yet all that ever is contained in Moses law, as many as
belong either to judgment / or to ceremonies, they were deed by and by and of
no strength unto them, which all ready did know, and did preach and teach,
that Christ / grace / or favor of god / and the gospel was come. And truly it
is not reasonable to believe / that John^ would have used such witness, or
that he would have shed his bloudde, and have died in the quarrel, to
maintain the truth of those laws / whose credence and auctorite he knew well
before, that they were allredy vaneshed a wey, and of no more effect, or at least, that they should cease and be taken awey sone after. Furthermore Paul
does grievously rebuke the hedes and rulers, and the comunalte of the Corynthes
/ by cause they suffered one of the city of Corinthe to be conuersante among
them unpunished, which being blinded, I wot not by what error, parauenture
by pretense of liberty of the gospel, had taken his stepmother to wife. Ye
and more over he does condemn the same self fellow unto the most grievous
punisheme^t of excommunication, not so much by cause he had done against the
law / as because he had done against nature, saying / that is such
fornication, as is not euin among the hethens, which be led or ruled by the
law of nature: menynge (no doubt) that nature does abhor / that one and
the same self flesh / that is to sey the fader and the son / should have to
do with one woman / and by this it can not but be evident and clear to every
man / that seeing Paul does judge / that this law of Moses / that no man should
mari his stepmoder, ought to be kept eue^ now among christian men. And seeing
that he does openly sey / that such fornication is utterly unnatural and
beastly / where a man has a do with his fathers wife, that is to say / with
her that is nyghe unto him / he seems plainly to mean thus / that surely
much less it is lefull for christen folks to marye women / that be more nere
of their bloudde / and that al those things / which be rekened up in the same
Leuiticall law / be (doubtless) in like manner forbidden / for as much as al
those prohibitions be grounded upon one reason / that is to say / because the
man and the woman be one flesh / and therefore be against the honesty and
shamefacednes or demurenes natural. And this same thing is proved also
manifestly by this / that the apostel in the same place also, does use this
word of fornicacion, by the which word not only he / but also all the other
apostelles / all most ever more in their writings / are wont to comprehend
all those unlawful maryages / and foul couplynges, that be forbidden in the
book Leuitical. For under the same manner also Paul privily and covertly does
(no doubt) condemn all those / which break these prohibitions of matrymonye
/ and foul / unclean / vnlefule / and to god abhomynable commixtio^s / where
he exhorts the Ephesyens / that no fornication / or uncleanness, or fylthynes
should be ones named or spoken of among them / and whereas / he writing unto
the Galates / techeth them / that fornication / uncleanness / and lechery / be
carnal works. For saint Hierome, declaring the same self place / says: The
first work of the flesh is fornication / the which among the other.vij.
vices is the most greattest sin / because that by the uncleanness of the
flesh the temple or church of god / that is to say / the soul and the body
of man, is polluted and defiled.

The second work of the flesh is called uncleanness / whom follows her
companion lechery. For as in the old law, where it is written of crimes and
sins / that be not to be spoken / which are done secretly / and it is a very
foul thing even to name them / lest the mouth of the speaker / and the ears
of the herers should be defiled / all such vices the scripture has
comprehended them generally / saying: Make you the children of Israhell to be
shamefacid and aferde of al uncleanness. Even after the same manner the apostel, in
this place also / does name and call all other extraordinary and unlawful
pleasures / and also the acts that be done in marriage self uncleanness and
lecherye / if they be not done with shamefacidnes and honesty / and as under
the eyes and in the sight of god / and only because they will take pain, and
do their duty to bring forth childerne. For saint Augustyne writes, that
like wise as under the name of theft in the.x. commandments is understand
all manner of unlawful usurping or medlinge with an other man's good: and under
the name of adulterye must be understand forbidden al manner of unlawful
medlinge to gether, and all manner of unlawful use of those members: So pleinly
all manner of unlawful couplynge or maryeng to gether of man and woman is called
in scripture foulenes / and all adultery and foulness or foul, and unclean
marienge also, in scripture is called fornicacion. For all though, as Isodore
says, al men / that do leudely abuse their bodies / have not one will of
their foul dealing: yet how some ever a man does pollute him self by
pleasure of the body, all is called fornicacion. For of delight and pleasure of
doing fornication, there come many and diverse foul lusts and vices: again
which the kingdom of heaven is shut / and man divided and departed from god.
Furthermore the apostels in the counsel / that they called and kept through
the holy ghost in Jerusalem, went about to p^scribe and show what points of
Moses law they / that had professed Christ's religion / and were become
Christ's men, should be bound to keep or to forbere, and they made a decre word
for word as here follows. It is thought convenient unto the holy ghost, and to
us, that there should be no further burdon laid upon you, than these necessary
things / that is to say / that ye abstein from contaminations of idols, and
from fornicacio^, from eatinge of beasts / that be strangled to death / and
from eatinge of blood of beasts. In the which place doubtless they covertly /
under the general name of fornicacion, did forbid all manner of couplinge and
marriage unlawful and prohibit by the law / and did prohibyte the self same
thing, which was understand under the name of fornicacion / after the
meaning and intent of the old law. For seeing that they do forbid fornicacio^,
even so as it is forbid by the rules and co^mandementes of the law / it can not
be / but we must needs think / that here in this decre of the apostels /
marriages unlawful / contrary to the disposition of the law / be also
forbidden. For of those marriages there was no need for the apostels to have
made further constitutions / or new provisions for them. for that thing that
is not changed, wherefore is it forbidden to stand? And saying that these
Leuitical laws of god were not changed: it follows, that they did stand still
in their old strength and auctortie: and by this reason the apostels had no
need to make a new law / but forbyddynge fornication generallly / did forbid
all those unlawful marriages / that god had forbidden before in the.18. chaptre
of the Leuitical. And therefore let no man flatter and gloss him self / as
though these co^mandmentes were light / or these reasons of little weight or
regard / when that you se evidently / that they be great fou^dacions and
grounds of our feythe / laid by the holy counsel of the apostels / and as
ye would say the strong pyllers and vpholders of the church / to drive out
fornicacion and idolatry: unto the which thing these fornicacions came very
nere. For every christian man does perteyne unto the church or company / for
the which Christ / willingly gave him self to sanctify it, and make it
sacre and holy / and to purge and cleanse hit with the washing of water
through the word of life. And again al we be members and parts of Christ's
own body, and we be of his bones. Therefore we had need to take sure keep /
that no man with foul and ungodly marriages do defyle and pollute the temple or
church of our lords body / wherein dwells the spirit of our lord. For who
so defiles the temple or church of god / our lord shall distroye him.
Wherefore me seems / that it is declared manifestly enough by these forsayde
reasons / that these prohybicions of marriage have authority and strength even
at this day / not only by Moses law / but also by the gospel / and by the
ordinance of thapostels / and they be both of goddis law / and of the law of
nature most hollely made / and evermore to be observed and kept / and at no
time to be broken. Now to come to the doctors of the church. Tertulian / the
most oldest writer of all that were sins the time of the apostels, is author
and does write / that this Leuitical forbyddynge / that a man should not mary
his brothers wife / was brought in / taught / and ordained specially and by
name even of Christ him self and his apostels / because that all the holle
church and company of Christ's faith should observe and keep it with all
devotion and reverence. For the same Tertulian disputes against Marcion upon
this point / that Christ in the gospel did excuse rather then distroye Moses
constitution of the law of divorce / or departing of man and wife. This
matter / says he / of divorce is not here brought in sodeinly of Christ /
but it takes his rote and ground of that thing / that John^ makes mention
of. For John^ did sore rebuke Herod the king / by cause he had, contrary to
the Leuiticall law / married the wife of his brother / which was deed, and
lest a daughter / that he had of her. And therefore John^ was cast into prison
by king Herod, and afterward by him slain. Therefore says Tertulian / that
after there was mention made of John^ / and what end followed of him / our
lord for an example of unlawful maryages and adultery did vehemently cry out
upon king Herod / saying openly and plainly, that every man also was an
adulter, who so ever did marye her / that was departed from her husband / that
there by he might make the ungodliness and abhominacion of Herod the more
grievous and heinous / which had married her / that was departed from her
husband / as well by his death as if she had been divorced from him / specially
seeing that his brother had a daughter by her / so that she was married unto him
unlawfully / and hit were but for this thing / because he did it by
instinction and mocion of foul lust of the body / and not by instinction and
mocion of the law / and therefore slew the prophet, which was the meynteyner
of the Leuiticall law.

And the same Tertulian also writes in an other place: Because, says he,
that certain persons some time do say, that they have no thing to do with
Moses law / which Christ doutles did not take away / but fulfilled and made
hit perfect, do some time take those things of the law / that lyketh them,
and make for their purpose: plainly we also say this / that the law is departed
and gone, as touching this point / that according to the mind and saying
of the apostels / the burdens of the law / which our fathers were not able to
bear / be utterly ceased and taken aweye. But as for those things that
perteyne to Justice and virtue / do remain holle / not only reserved / but
also amplified and increassed / so that our instyce and goodness / which be
christian people / should be much greatter and perfecter than the justice of
the scribes and phariseis / and be such justice / as a very just man ought to
have. And our chastity likewise should excel and pass theyrs / and in no point
be less than theyrs. Now because it is commanded in Moses law / that a man
should take to marriage his brothers wife / that is departed without children /
because he should stir up sede / or get issue to his brother: And because
this thing may happen often times to one person / as that one woman may be
married to.vi. or.vij. brethren / one after an other / for lack of issue by
the former brother / according to the subtle question of the Sadduces in the
gospel: therefore some do think / that the oftennes of marriage is permysed
also in other cases. But these men should have understood first of all the
reason and consideration of this precept / and so they should have well known
/ that this reason is now ceased and one of the things / which be now
void and of no strength nor authority. For a man was bound of necessite to
marie the wife of his brother / which was departed without children: First
because that as yet that old blessyng of god: Increse you and multiply, ought
to run forth and continue. Second by cause the children were punisshed for the
fathers fautes. Thirdly because that the dry and baren persons were had for
defamed persons: therefore an ordinance was made / that they should have issue
by other of their kynne / as ye would say by a proctour / and bigotten after the
death of the father / because that they / which were departed without issue /
not by the fault of nature and by preuencion of death should not therefore be
judged accursed and unhappy. But now the blessing of encresynge and
multiplyeng bodily and carnally is ceased / because the world is at an end.
For the apostle induces and counsayleth us / saying. There is no more, but
that they also, which have wives, should be, as if they had none, because the
time is short. And again, The sour grape that our fathers did eat / that is
the sin that they did / does no more stonysshe, or set on edge, the tethe of
the childerne. For every man shall dye for his own sin. And more over the
baren now be not all only without infamy and rebuke, but also have deserved
thank and favor of god / being invited and admitted into the kingedome of
heaven. And therefore now this law, that a man should succeed into his brothers
marriage, or that he should marie his brothers wife, is now utterly deed and
buried: and the contrary of this law has place, that a man should not succeed
into his brothers marriage, nor marie his brothers wife: And by this (as we said
before) that law which is ceased / and is no more of strength / by cause the
reason of it is taken away or ceased / can not be a convenient prosse for an
other thing. Therefore saying that these things before said were written of
Tertulia^ / at that time, when the church had made very few laws, or truly
none at all, beside tho things, which Christ him self and his apostels had
taught / it is plainly to be believed that this law, that a man should not marie
his broders wife / came by the ordinance of Christ and his apostels / and that
it was renewed / confirmed / and declared / as ye would say, by a new conuena^t
and agreement and by a latre testament, as a law very worthy to be observed of
al christian men for ever more, and that ought to be kept with all reverence and
religion. And that holy man saint Gregory, which for his great learning and
virtue was named Great / does greatly confirm the same thing / which when
saint Augustine the bishop of the English men, had in time past written to
him for counsel / whether two brothers germayn might marie ij. sisters / which
were descended of a stock far from them, he answers, that this thing in
all cases was lefull to be done, by cause there is nothing found in holy
scripture / that is thought to speak against this point. And again / when he
was asked of the same bishop / unto what degree Christis faithfuls might
marye with their kynsewomen / and whether it was lefull for them to marie with
their stepmothers / and with their brothers wives / whom at that time they
called cosyns / he answered in order to both two questions in this manner. There
is a certain erthly and worldly law within the dominion of Rome / that the
son and daughter of brother and sister / or of two brothers germayns / or of
two sisters / may be married to gether. but we have learned by experience / that
there could never issue come of such marriage / and the holy law of god
forbyddeth us to discover the foulenes of our cousyns. wherefore it must needs
be amongst faith full or Christian people, that if they, that be of kynne,
will laufully mary / that they be in the third or fourth degree of kynred. For
they, that be in the second degree / which we spoke of before, may in no case
be married to gether. And as for a man to be married with his stepmoder / it is a
grievous synnne. why so? because it is written in the laws of god, thou shalt
not discover the foulenes of thy father. For although the son can not
discover the foulenes of the father: yet because it is written / The man and
wife shall be two in one flesh or body: doutles who so shall presume to
discover the foulness of his stepmother / which has been one flesh and
body with his father / he in deed does discover the foulenes of his father.
Ageyn, it is forbidden by the Leuiticall law, that a man should myngle or
marye with his cosyn, that is to sey his brothers wife, because that she /
being ones joined with the former brother, is made his flesh: and for the
same thing saint Ihon^ Baptist lost his heed, and by an holy martyrdom was
brought to his end. Unto whom it was not seyde / that he should deny Christ /
yet he was slain for confessing Christ. But because our lord Jesus Christ
had said: I am the treuth / saint John^ truly shed his blood for Christ / by
cause he was slain for the treuth. But because there be some among the
English people / which while they were yet infidels or vnfaythfuls / as hit
is said / have myngled them self by such abomination, and not to be spoken
marriages / they must be warned / when they come to the faith / that they
absteyne and forbere their carnal pleasure between man and wife, and that they
believe and grant / that it is a grievous sin to use it. let them fear the
terrible judgment of god / lest for a little carnal pleasure they fall into
the torments of everlasting pains. Now reder mark diligently with me these
words of saint Gregory, and consider me here in his writing.iii. or.iiii.
things. First that the most holy and most excellent learned doctor, both in the
law of god, and of man utterly and plainly affirms, these Leuitical laws,
that a man should not mary his brothers wife, with the other / to be of such
auctorite, that he says openly, that they be the very law of god. Second,
that the same laws be now at this time of such authority and strength /
that it is not leful in any case to contracte matrimony contrary to that is
forbidden in the same. Thirdly, that the occasion of saint Iohn^s martyrdom
was this / because he would meinteyn and uphold the truth and auctorite of the
same laws against Herod the king / which had married his brothers wife.
Fourth, that the marriages / which certain englisshe men had contract with
their broders wives / and that even before they had taken the faith upon them /
to be so unlawful / and not to be spoken, that they could not without dedly
sin render their duty of marriage one to an other / nor yet abide still in
the same marriages: the which thing truly we think ought not lightli to be
passid over. For ones saint Paul bids and commands, that they, which be
laufully married / should another be divorced / nor yet the ton to deny the
the other the right and duty of marriage. Agein, saint Gregory had granted
license unto the said englisshemen / that they might contract matrimoni in
the.iiij. degree / and that marriage contract in the.iiij. degree should not be
broken. wherefore these thingis considered / it must needs be / that there was
doutles some great cause / why saint Gregory would not admit or suffer such
marriages / as the englisshme^ had contract with their brothers wives / at the
lest wise to have suffered them by a dispensation or license, if it had been
lefull to have dispe^sed with the^. And truli there lacked not causes, which
ought to have moved him for to have dispe^sed with the^: As because of the
faith of christe^dom / the which some freill persons had lever peraue^ture
utterly to forsake and renounce, tha^ to have departed from their tenderly
beloved wives / as the times were than in the beginning of the faith. An other
cause should have been this / that they had bound them self by marriage before
the washing of baptism / at the which time there were no laws written, by
the which the heathens were forbidden from such marriage of their brothers
wives. But this most holy and most wise man thought / that in all and before
all a man should regard the commandment of god. And he would not be author
nor causer to no man for to break that law. He saw, and plainly did judge /
that he, which had married his brothers wife, has done contrary to the
principal cause of marriage / and against the natural inclination of man /
which he has to have issue and posterite / because that god says: He that
marieth his brothers wife / shall dye without children. he saw that this is
plainly an ungodly deed / abominable before god and man / and also against the
nature of man / and as nygh as can be unto the nature and life of beasts. He
saw / how grievous punisshment is abiding them / which have defiled them self
with this foul sin. Therefore he iuged / that another peace / nor yet faith
and christendom, nor any other thing in this world, beside forth, is of
such virtue and goodness, that it is able to recompense and weye out the
malyciousnes of this deed. He would not than that such marriages should stand
still and remain / or be called / or so much as be thought to be marriages:
but he would rather have them broken and undone / and did command / that as
many as had entangled them self with such marriage / should be admonisshed and
warned / that if they would profess Christ's religion / they should from thens
forward absteyne and forbere from meddling the one with the other: If not /
they should have for their carnal pleasure / the tourmentes of everlasting
punisshment. Furthermore reder there be other bishops also / which in time
passed were in very deed greattest and highest / not only for their lerninge
and wisdom / but also for the holiness of their life / that may clearly
teach the / that these Leuitical forbyddynges of marriage have in them the
authority and majesty both of the law of god and of the law of nature / and
that by very good right and reason. Among the which Popes be princypally /
Calixtus / Zachary / and Innocent / the residue we will not speak of. For
Calixtus / when he was asked why the maryages of kynsfolke were judged to be
unlawful / he answers: Because / says he / that both gods law / and man's
law / has forbidden them.

And truly gods law does not only cast out the childerne / which were
gotten in such maryages / but also does call them accursed: and the laws of man do call them infamed persons / and do put them back from their
fathers heritage. Further Pope Zachary answers in this manner unto Theodore
the bishop of Tycin or Pauy, asking counsel of him / whether that the god
daughter might be married with the natural son: Thy holy brotherheed, says
Zachary, knows right well, that our lord did co^mande Moses, saying: Thou
shalt not discover the foulenes of thy father, or mother, or sister: for it is
thyn own foulenes. Saying therefore that we are commanded to absteyne from our
own kynrede carnal / much more it is convenient, that we should with all
straytenes beware of her / that is our faders daughter spritual. which place
the gloser expou^ding does argue / that the Pope / al though he would / can not
dispe^se i^ the.ij. degree of co^sanguinite / nor yet i^ the.ij degree of the
first manner of affinity. for the ij. degree of co^sanguinite and of this
affinite has his beginning of the law of nature. And again because the same
degree is forbidden expressly in the old testament of god. Furthermore holy Pope
Innocent the third also / when the king of Hungary had complained unto him of
the bishop of Quiclesiense / that he should have misused him self with his
own nece / he would give no ear to such complaint. For who, says he, can
lightly believe, that the bishop of Quinclesie^se would be turned to so
shameful passion / that he would commit abominable incest with his own propre
nece, saying that even after the minds and sayenges of the hethens, the law
of nature does not suffer, that we should suspect any grievous crime between
such persons. And the same Pope also, following the holy constitutions of the
emperors in this point, For the same consideration / did make a law / that
prestes might keep their moders / their daughters / and their sisters germayns
within their houses.

Furthermore the same Pope / when the archedeacon of Byturs sent unto him to
know / whether that wife / which was departed from her husband without
judgment of the church / because her husband and she were in so nygh degree of
kynred / that the sete apostolic could not / nor yet was not wont to dispense
with it, ought to be restored again to her husband / answers on this manner:
This woman / says he / which does know the kindred between her husband and
her / specially in those degrees / which be forbidden by the law of god / can
not have to do carnally with this her husband without deadly sin. For all
that is not done with faith and good conscience / is sin: and what so ever
is done against our conscience / does bylde to hell ward. And therefore it
were but folly to give judgment in this case / that this woman should be
restored again to her husband, by cause she ought not in this point to obey
the judge contrary to god / but rather should mekely suffer to be
excommunicate. For if she should be restored again unto this man / there
should rise a marvelous perplexe and intricate difficulty. for she should be
bound to do her duty to her husband / because of the judges sentence, and
again she ought not to do it because of her own conscience / seeing she
knows / that she is of his kindred. And so it should come to pass / that they
should be grievously combred / and a snare should be set for them both / to
bring them to hell / seeing that they can not carnally come to gethers / nor
yet be married the ton with the other. Therefore / seythe he, as often as kindred
is obiecte within the degrees forbidden by the law of god / it is thought best
/ that judgment be given / that restitucion be made as concerning al other
things / but as concerning bed and carnal medlynge / restitucion must
utterly be differred / saying it is better for both parties to be discharged
in their conscience under this manner / than by the other wey to remain in
charge and cumbraunce of conscience. And Innocent does confirm in the foresaid
place this judgment of his / by diverse reasons, first by the answers of two
Popes / Lucius and Clement, of the which the one utterly denies / that there
should be made any restitution in the foresaid case, and that they ought in
any wise to know of the exception / that is / whether they be in such degree
of kynrede or no, before they come to the article of restitution, whereby she
should be restored home again to her husband.

And the other Pope, all though he grant, that she should be restored / yet
when that is opteyned, he thinks hit is not lefull for the manne / which
does know of his kynrede between him and the woman, another to pay the duty
of marriage ageynste his own conscience, nor yet that he can require the same
of the woman, Because, says he, if he should do it / he buyldeth to hell
ward: no more then he can, that is married to his kynsewoman and has knowledge
of his kinrede / although there be no questyon nor doubt moved upon his
marriage, but only his own knowledge and conscience.

Furthermore Innocent confirmed his saying by a commune opinion and
determynacyon of the Canon laws / by the which doubtless hit is determined /
that in degrees of kynrede / forbidden by the law of god / there should be no
way to restytution / by cause that in those degrees there can be no
dyspensacyon: But in those degrees / the which be forbidden by the law of man / there may be fulle and effectual restitucyon / because in these
degrees there may be dyspensation. Nor be does not sin / which in this
article does pay the debt of marriage at the commandment of the Church.

And trewely many other things there be written of the same holy man, for
this purpose, in other places: but our book would grow to an exceeding
greatte volume, if we should write them all. And these things, that we have
shewedde, gentle indyfferente reder, do clerelye open unto the / what these
good Popes have determynedde upon these Leuitycall prohybytions of matrymonie
/ which is this / that they do bind of necessite / because they be both of
the law of god / and of Nature / so that they judge / that they ought of
necessite to be observed both among christian folks / and among infidels and
the vnfeythfuls.

Now beside all this / we shall prove the same by the authority of holy
counsayles. For doubtless in the counsel of Tollet it is decreed in this wise:
we decree / that no faithful man shall desire to have any nere kynswoman of
his to be married unto him / because it is written in gods law: No man shall
come nigh her / that is next of his blood to discover her foulenes. And hit is
written again: Every soul / that shall do any of those things, shall
perysshe from the mids of his people.

And in the counsel of Agathe it is ordained in this manner: we reserve
utterly no manner of forgyuenes nor perdon / nor dispensation / for inceste
maryages / but we will in any case / that they be punisshed, except only they
heal their adulterye by departing the one from the other. For as for inceste
persons / we judge them not worthy to have any name of marriage, seeing it is
a deadly thing even to make any token or mention of such persons. And we
judge them to be incest persons / which by carnal medlynge have defiled his
brothers wydowe / which was in manner his sister before / or he that has taken
to wife his sister germayne / and he that has married his stepmother. etc. All
these persons we doubt not but they have been before time, and by this our
constitution be, incest persons: and we command, that they abide and pray
among them that be yet unchristened, and but only lerners of the christian
faith / and not to come among christian folk / till they have sufficiently
repented them self, and amended that they have misdone.

Furthermore in the counsel of Neocesar / and in the Synod of Gregory the
younger / it was decreed, according to the wordis of god, that a woman / which
had been married to.ii. brethren, should be put back from communion, and from
receiving the sacrament until she dye. And a man that had married his brothers
wife should be an anatheme, in the which synod al to gethers answered an
anatheme be he / that is as much to seye / as damnacion to everlasting death.

Last of all, and for a conclusion / that sentence of wiclyffe, wherein he did
bold that the prohibicions of matrymony, written in the Leuiticall / be only
judicial precepts of Moses, and therefore the causes of diuors brought in by
the mean of kynred and affinite / to be brought in without ground and
fou^dacio^, and only by the ordinance of man / was dampened as contrary to
all virtue and goodness, as heretical, and expressly against holy scripture, in
the great convocation, that was had first at London / and after at Oxenforde /
and last of all in the counsel of Constance.

There be decrees of other counsels and aunswers in writynge of other of the
Popes, which do subscrybe and agree to these foresaid determinations / of the
which thou shalt find very many in the Popes law / both in the book of
decrees / and of the epistols decretalles also: but we trust / gentill and
indifferent reder, that these forsayde things shall fully content the. For
thou see here first of all, in manner an hole commune assent and agremente of
the holle church / and furthermore thou see the Popes them self do give so
great majesty and godly authority unto these Leuiticall prohybicyons, that
they do plainly affirm and hold steadfastly, that who so ever do marie
contrary to the commandment of these laws / be not in very deed man and
wife, nor they can not have to do carnally to gethers, without deedly sin,
and that they may depart in soundre without any ingement or decree of the
Church / and that they another can nor ought to be compelled by any judgment
of man, either to require or to perform the use and custom of marriage one to
an other. Thus say the Popes, and hit is to be thought and believed, that both
they did know the compass of their jurisdiction / and what they were able to
do, and that they had would rather to have encreassed and amplifyed their power
and auctoryte, than to have restrained hit and made hit less. And reder thou
see / that they leye none other cause hereof / but only this, that is because
none auctorite of man can extend or stretch so far / that it may releasse by
any dispensation the forbyddynges of god.

More over thou see / and except we be deceived / thou do grant and
confess also / that these decrees and laws of these Popes and counsels, upon
the marriage of the brother with the brothers wife / is plainly none other
thing then a publishyng and sendyng out of the law of god, and of the techyng
of the apostels, and no new law of their own invention or making. For they
do never so forbydde such marriage / as though hit had been lefull before time /
but only rehersynge unto us the old law of god, and the received or approved
custom and usage of the church. And that there has been such a custom and
usage even from the first beginning of the church / and that it has been
observed before there was any Popes law / it is evidently known by the words
of Tertulyan / which we have before rehearsed.

Finally to make an end thou shalt understand / gentill reder / that the
requests and suits of diverse persons / which have desired dispensacyons in
these degrees / have many times heretofore been denied and repelled by the
Popes of Rome, which answered them thus: It is not in any case lefull for us
to dispense with the laws of god. And this we shall show you here after. Now
saying then that very natural inclination does move us unto the observation and
kepinge of these forbiddinges, saying reason does lead us, honesty stirs
us, fere of god, and love of god and of our neighbor, goodness and virtue
does desire us / the co^modites and benefits / which come by the increase of
love and charity, do counsel us to the same: And seeing that god, most best
and almighty, made these laws him self, and that the consent and agreement of
all people has approved the same, finally saying that the same self finger of
god / which is the holy spirit of god, which commanded these prohibicions
to be written in the Leuiticall book / does ratify and confirm the same
prohibitions / both in the godspel of Christ, and in the writing of his
apostels, and also in the sacre holy counsels of the church / ruled and
governed doubtless by the holy ghost: And saying they be commanded of necessite
to be kept of all christian people / it can not be, but that the sentence and
determinatio^s of these universities is of as undoubted credence and auctorite,
as can be, where they say, that to mary her that is left of his brother /
dyenge without chylderne / is so forbidden / both by the law of god and of
nature / that the Pope is not of power to dispense with any such maryages,
whether they be all ready contracte or else to be contracte.

The third chaptre.
ANd thus we think, that we have well and sufficiently confirmed and
stablished our intent and purpose by the Popes law / and by the authority of
counsels. Now next we will go about to fortifye and make good the same by
the most excellent and most faithful interpreters, and most true doctors /
that expound holy scripture. Among whom Origin comes first to our
remembrance / for he expou^ding the.xx. chaptre of the Leuitical does declare
at large this sentence of god, Keep you all my commandments and my
iustifienges, and my iugementes: it seems says he / requisite and necessary /
that we show / what is signified by every one of these words / and truly (as
far as ever I could perceive) a precepte or commandment is / As for an
example that, which is said in the.x. commandementes: Thou shall not slay,
thou shalt not do none adulteri. for this is only precept or comanded, but
there is no punissheme^t put to, for the breking of it. but now these same
self precepts or teachynges be rehearsed again / but here penalties be put
to them. For in this place it is said: what so ever man commits adultery
with a man's wife / and with his neighbors wife / let them dye, both the man
/ that does adultery, and the woman, that he does it with / and he that shall
sleep with his fathers wife / and shall discover the foulenes of his father /
both two let them dye / for they be gyltie and death worthy. There were
precepts or reules given alredye of these things before, but there was not
put to / what punysshement he should have / that did break them: Now
therefore these same things be rehearsed again / and the penalties of every
trespass is set. And therefore these laws may well be called iustifiinges and
judgments / by the which he, that does sin, or breketh the commandment,
is judged to receive / that is just for his trespass. But behold the order of
the godly wisdom. god does not set punysshement by and by at the first / as soon as he had yeuen the precepts or rules / bow men should live. for he will
have the keep the precepts of thy father / and to do as thy father wylleth and
byddeth the / not for fear of punisshement / but for love that thou haste to
virtue and goodness, and to thy father. But if thou dispysest to do as thy
father techeth the, than there is a commandment, that thou shall be punisshed
/ not because thou art a man, so much, as because thou art a contemner and
dispiser of thy fathers teaching. Therefore first of al thou art provoked and
moved by gentylnes and fair means, as a child. and David testifies, that we
be children / where he says: you al be gods, and the children of him that is
highest. that if thou will not be obedient like a good child, but will be a
transgressour and a dispiser of thy fathers teaching / thou shalt be
punysshed like a bond man. After this he says furthermore. And if any man
shall sleep with his daughter in law, his sons wife / let him dye, both.ij.
have committed impiete or abhominacion, and they be gyltie and death worthy.
These laws and precepts god had given before without any punysshmentes or
penalties. For he had said: Thou shall not discover the foulenes of thy sons
wife / and all the other precepts that there do follow. And this place like
wise there he puts without punysshementes / but here he has put hit with
diverse kinds of punysshementes. And in the end, where he speaks of the same
Leuitical prohibitions, at the last he makes this conclusion. Therefore it is
good says he, to take good keep / lest at any time we reverence our carnal
fader, or our father of heaven with less honor than we ought, and they
deserve. And like wise hit is good to observe / and honor our mother, and also
to observe and keep all other such co^mandeme^tes, what so ever they be, that
commend to us shamefacidnes, clennes, and chastity, to thentent that we should
follow / and live according to the same / that we should another according to
the carnal law of Moses / be in danger of death here in this present life /
another after fall in to the punysshement to come, of everlasting fire of
hell / after the spiritual law of the gospel. And like wise Chrysostom
does agree with this saying of Origin, where as he does stiffly and plainly
hold, that fable and tale / that the Sadduces made upon the woman / that they
said was married to.vij. brothers / to be but a fantasy, and a thing fained and
imagined: For the Iues, says he / be such men / that we se them even now at
this time to be mightily afferd to marie with their brothers wives, because /
as you would say / they think surely there should some mischief come of it.
And not withstanding that the law should constrain and bind the Iues to mary
their brothers wives, yet for all that we se them often times little regard
it / and make light of hit / and not to do hit. wherefore Ruthe / a woman also
of Moab, was driven to mary with one of her kynne / which was very far of.
And Thamar was constrained to disguise her self in a common woman's apparel,
and to steal seade of her father in law. Also Basilius the great / is of the
same sentence and mind / that these other two foresaid doctors be: which
wrote unto Diodore the bishop of Tarsus on this wise: There be come to my
hands certain writings / which be sent out under the name of Diodore, but
the things that were contained in them / were like to be any other man's
writingis rather tha^ Diodors. But me seems / that there is some crafty
fellow / that has put upon him thy person / that by this means at the lest
he might misuse the authority of thy name, to get him credence, and to be
believed of his herers and scholars. For this man that wrote this thing, when
he was asked whether it was lefull for a man, when his wife was deed / to marie
his wives sister, did not abhor this question / in so much that he suffered
to here it with a very good will, and did study and labor to promote and set
forwards this lust, which is to shameless / to wanton / to foul and
uncleanly. And if I had those same wrytynges with me / I would doutles now or
this time have sent them to the / because thou might socour and help both
thy self and also the treuth. But because the same man / which brought the
writings, carried them by and by away with him again / and afterward bore
them about with him / showing them in every place / as though he had gotten
the victory of us / which before time had forbidden such manner of maryages /
and did boost / that he had this license of us in writing: I determined to
write unto the of this thing, to the intent that we should of both hands go
about to reprove this imagined tale / and falsely forged saying of this fellow,
to show that it is nothing but a sterke lie / lest it may hurt them, into
whose hands it shall fortune to come. And truly first of al we may leye
against him the common custom, and such a custom, which by right and
reason is as strong as any law / because it is no new thing, but has
continued of long time, and was brought unto us / not by every body / but by
the holy fathers, and the custom is this: That if any man, overcome with a
shameless and an uncleanly affection and lustynes / do fortune to join so
vnlefully, that he coupleth him self by marriage with.ij. systers / this man is
iuged another to have contracte any marriage / and that he must not be admitted
in to the communion of the church / or to come into the company of christian
folk, before that they have broken this so unlawful couple or bo^de / and be
departed the ton from the other, in so much that if we had none other thing in
this matter / to keep awey this so great a mischefe, only the auctorite of this
custom were sufficient. But because who so ever wrote this epistle / went
only about this thing, to bring in to the manners of men so great a
pestilence and corruption by colors of arguments / by a crafty and subtle
reason: it shall be necessary also for us, not utterly to absteyne from the aid
and help of reasons. how be it in things that be very plain and well known /
the opinion that men have conceived already / and that does appear to have been
received by the opinyons and minds of holy men, in so much that there is a
custom brought up by the same: ought to be of more weight and regard with
every man, than that thing, which reason invented and imagined afterward /
should be of power to persuade.

It is written / say they / in the Leuiticall. Thou shalt not take the sister
of thy wife, being yet a live, to cause them strive / which of them shall be
best beloved and most set by / for to discover her foulness upon her. By
the which wordis it is open / sey they / that it is suffered to take thy wives
sister / when thy wife is deed. whereunto first of all I answer and say this:
what so ever the law says / it speaks to them, that be bound to keep the law
as to the Iues / but not to us / that be christian folk. For by this mean we
should be bound to be circumcised / to keep the sabbat or day of rest / and to
forbear and abstain from meats. For we should not submit us and bind our
self to the yoke of the bondage of the law, where as we find any thing,
that does agree with our apetite and pleasure / and when there appears any thing
in the law / that is heavy and hard, and contrary to our pleasure and appetite
/ then to run to the liberty and fredome / that Christ in his godspell and
law has set us in. But if any man ask this question / whether this thing be
written in the law or no? whether a man that has married the one sister may
also marie the other? I say for a suertie* that which unto us is both
manifest and true / that there is no such thing written in the law. for a
thing that is not expressed in the text or letter / but it may be gethered of
the words / that the lawemaker meaned so / if such a thing be brought in by
manner of a reason / as that must needs follow of that is said there / though
it be not expressly written / to say whether the law maker meaned thus or no
/ this is a point that belongs to the maker of the law self to determine /
and not to him, which is desired to tell, what is expressed in the scripture.
For else if every man may say, that this was the lawers mind / and though he
spoke it not, yet he understood it, and this he did mean, as of the words may
well be gethred: tha^ if there be any man of so ungodly audacitie / and wicked
boldness / which / even while his wife is alive / would have her sister to his
wife, he shall not lack / whereby he may prove that he may laufully do it / by
a like gloss and distinction. ye and no doubt hereof / for the scripture is
this: Thou shall not take thy wives sister, while thy wife is a live, for to
make strife and debate between them / which of them should be better loved. Of
this it follows, and so the lawemaker should seem to mean, that if there be no
such strife for preeminence of love between them, tha^ it is not forbid, for a
man to be married at ones to.ij. sisters. For he that will set his mind upon his
lustines and pleasure, will hold styffly, and say / that it is not possible,
that any such emulation or strife should chance between systers. And by this
mean, syns that the cause is ceased and gone / for the which the marriage
of.ij. systers unto one man is forbidden: what now can let, that it should not
be lefull for any man to have at one time.ij. systers to his wives / if we will
admit such facion of reasoninge in scripture? But thou wylt say to us, this
reason that we make now / is not in the scripture* we grant and say like wise
again to the / no more is that reason determined and certeyned by scripture /
by the which it should be proved of the contrary part / that it is lefull for a
man to mary.ij. systers. For the invention and gloss / by the which both the
parties says, that their intent and purpose does follow of the scripture,
though it be not expressed in scripture, is all of like on the one side, and on
the other / and gives asmoche lybertye and license to do noughtli with as
much impunishme^t the tone gloss as does the the other. But a man ought
dilygently to have considered the preceptis that go before / and then he should
have had no need to have taken all this labor and pain, for to inuente and
imagen additions to scripture on this manner. For it appears, that the
lawemakers mind was not to speak generally in those laws of all manner of
sin / but to forbid specially and only those vices / the which were
commonly used among the Egyptions / from whens the children of Israel came /
and also that were specially used among the Chananees, into whose land they
were goinge at that time. For in this place of the Leuiticall the very text of
the scripture is thus written, word for word, as follows: you shall not do,
says god / after the custom of the land of Egypt, where you have dwelled,
nor you shall not do after the manner and usage of the region of Chanaan / in to
the which I shall bring you / nor ye shall not live after their laws / nor
follow such things as be lefull among them. In so much truly / that it is
very likely / that as yet there had been no such piacull or abhominacion
committed among those nations. And therefore it was thought, that there neded no
lawmaker / nor law to forbid that kind of sin / that was not used: but that
the custom / used of long time among them / should be sufficient to make men
abhor and deteste so great a vice.

How is it then / seeing he forbyddeth the greatter vice / that he speaks not
also of the lesser? doubtless by cause he judged, that there should come many /
which would be given to pleasure, and would follow the myscheuous example of the
patriarche Jacob / that married his wyfes sister, and would mary with their
wives systerne, ye and that their wives being a live.

But now what shall we do? whether shall we confess and grant those things,
that be written? or shall we apply our wit to be somewhat curious, and to search
out those things / that be wrapped up in silence? It is not provided fore,
here in this law, that the father and the son should not use one harlotte:
and yet the prophet judges them worthy of as great rebuke as may be, where he
says: Lo the father and the son go to one woman. Finally how many and
diverse kinds of sin has the crafty dyscipline and scole of the deuell
invented / the which the scripture of god passes over in secrets and syle^ce,
and that for this co^syderacion and intent / by cause the scripture of god
suffers not her honorable and reverend majesty to be contamined and
disteyned with the names of so foul vices / but scripture comprehends all
manner of uncleanliness under general names. Like wise as Paul the appostle,
under this one general word uncleanliness, comprehends all manner of
uncleanliness / and not to be spoken impurites of man and woman* where as he
says: Let another harlottry, nor fornicacion, nor yet no manner of uncleanness,
be ones named among you, as it besemeth saints. So by this we may se, how
true it is / that the silence of scripture can not help us, that we should
have liberty to fulfill our fylthy pleasures.

How be it we judge / that the lawmaker did not utterly hold his peace in this
matter / but that he has forbidden this thing as diligently and as vehemently,
and streitly as can be. For seeing he says: Thou shall not approach to no
woman, that is nere of thy flesh and bloudde / to discover her foulenes or
priueties: This saying does comprehend also our kynne by affinity. For what
kynne can be more surely knyt, or more nere to a man / than his own wife or to
speak better, than his own propre flesh or body? For now they be no more
two bodies / but one flesh or body. And for this cause hit is not laufull in
any case for the wives sister to approach unto her sisters husband, which is
nere of her kyn. For like wise as we absteyne from our stepmother, as we do
from our own mother / and hit is as unlawful to marye our wives daughter / as
our own daughter: even in like manner we may not mary our wives sister no more
than we may our natural systers. And on the other side among women this
reason of kynrede has place in like manner. for women be forbidden to meddle
with the nigh kinsmen of their husbands as the men may not meddle with the
nygh kynswoman of their wyfes / seeing that the rightes and laws of kindred do
al of like bind them both, the women, as well as the men / as it is evidently
known. But I do admonisshe and say unto all men, which think any thing on
marriage, that the flower and state of this world taryeth not / and there is a
short time to come / to thentent that they, which have wives should behave
them self, as if they had no wives. That if any man on the other side will ley
against me this saying of god, Increse you and multiply, then would I laugh at
the man's vndiscretnes / which does not consider the times / when the laws
were made / and what were the occasions of making of them. For second marriage
is permised to avoid fornicacio^, and barlatry with commune women, and
concubynes / and to comfort the impotentnes and great frailty of nature / and
not because it should be (if I may so call it) a gardeuiandes or mainteynaunce
to intemperaunce and excess of such pleasure: and therefore says the
apostell. They that can not refrain and forbear / let them mary. How be it
they that mary not, do not against the law though they marie not. But such
kind of men, that would marie their wives systerne / because their judgment
and understanding is all blinded with a shameful and an infamous affection and
lust / they look not ones upon nature / which long sins has divised certain
and special names, the which should show of whens every man is borne. and
where a man marieth.ij. systers / this can not be. for they that be borne of
such couchinge to gethers, what name shall one of them call the other,
brethren or cosyns, that is systers childerne? For soth by the mean of this
mingle they may call each other indifferently / both brethren and also cosins,
with great confusion both of names and of kynred also. wherefore O man, make not
thy babes a stepmother in the stead of their other mother / or aunt by the
mother side. Nor arm her not with cruel ielosyes and spytes of stepmothers,
which ought before of nature and kind to cherisshe thy children even like a
mother, where as now unto them / that thou had by the first sister,
the.ij. sister, if thou marie her, must needs be a stepmother. for of
stepmothers only the hatred and malice is so egre, that it reuengeth
displeasures after the death of them / that they be displesed with. And where
as in all other discordes death makes peace / the spyte and malice reygnethe
and ragethe in them even after death.

For a conclusion of this matter, if a man desire a wife / according to the
law / the world is wide, he may have choice enough. But if he regard not the
law / but his lust, so much more he oucht to be withstand, for to learn him /
to keep his vessel clean / according to honesty / not to the desire of the
flesh. I was about to write more unto the / but it should be out of measure
for a letter / and I pray god that other this our admonicion may prevail
against all such foul affection and lust, or else that this pestilence come no
nere us: but that it may wear out in the same places, where as such
shameful boldenes first began. On these men's side is also Isichius /
Gregory Nazianzens scholar / an excellent learned man in holy scripture. For he
expouninge this place of the Leuitical says thus. The intent of all this process
is this, that we should abstain from all vice / and do those things that be
virtuous. For the lawemakers intent here is this / to restreine us from all
lechery / and not to be spoken marriages, and from fornication, both spiritual
and carnal. wherefore when he gives these forsayde commandementes / he says:
I your lord god. which words he spoke for this cause, that when we perceive
that he, which commanded us to do these things / is our creator / and made
us of noucht / and that he is our lord and god / we should with all heart and
mind apply our self to keep the things which he commanded. For god did not
in one place of the law give twice commandment / that they should do his
judgments, and keep his co^mandeme^tes: god made no such rehersall nor
doubling / nor said not twyse: I your lord god: but Moses, yea rather the
holy ghost, that spoke in Moses, does this for this consideration, that these
holy laws should not be despised or littell regarded, by cause some said,
that they were Moses laws. But these things, that be here commanded / be not
Moses precepts, but the commandments of god. Again Moses rehearsed these
things because there was meruaylous dilygence and study taken, that both the
letter and text / and the lytterall or carnal sens and plain meaning of
these precepts should be observed and kept / and also the spirirituall and
gostly understanding / and that a great and a right law should compose and
order both the outward and the inward man also, which is bound to keep
both the outward superfyciall meaning of this law / and also the inward and
mystical intent of the same. And as for the vttermore and superficial mind of
this law / forbyddeth them / that be nyghe of blood / to have any a do to
gether by the way of marriage or other wise, because that thing also was kept
among the hethens, whose land god did take from them / to give it the Iues
for their heritage. And by cause he would show that this commandment is
necessary and of necessite to be kept / he does not only reckon up the
degrees of kynred / but also in reckoning them / he sets forth plainly the
cause, why every law was made / and the co^mixtion or couplynge of such
persons he calls it discovering of foulenes or shamelesnes / signifienge,
that who so ever commytteth any such deeds, every body should be ashamed of
him / every body turn their faces from him, and that he ought to be abhorred
and hated of every body. For who so vnhelleth the foulenes / or the parties to
be ashamed of, of his kynsfolke, be they of kyn gostly and spiritual, or bodili
and carnal / he is found to be a breker and a transgressour of all the holle
law. For the thing / that he does, is contrary to love and charity, which is
the fulfyllynge and performing of all the holle law. And that a man or a woman
is after no small facion polluted and defiled by these forsayde vices, the
indignation vengeance and punysshement, that is appointed for such vice, does
evidently show. And truly we ought not to pollute our self with never one of
them. For who so is polluted with any one of them, is polluted with them all.
Therefore when the law would show / that they be all joined and knytte fast
to gether / so that a man can not offend i^ one but he must offend in all / and
so be polluted by all / for this co^sideracion the law has gathered them all
to gether, and couched them up here all in one place / and proves that they be
so grievous and heinous enormities / that they distroyed holle nations / and
polluted the land, and wha^ it was polluted, made it for to be forsaken / and
to vomit out and refuse them that had committed such vice in hit, not because
the land could expel, put out, or euomit them / but because even the very
earth self, of the own Nature / that god has given it, does wayle and
mourn at such abominations: and god that is ryghtefull takes vengeance
both for this mourning and heaviness of the earth his creature, and also for
breach of his law / and for infamy and villainy done to his creature.

He makes often rehersall / and stableth his law, and confirms his thretis,
and ageyn sets punisshementes, and that for this intent, because he would
fear us, and quicken us to forbere such things, as he forbids us, that we
should not fall in to the penalty / that he has thret. And truly the penalty
is the loss and destruction of the soul, which begi^neth here in this life by
syn, that is death of the soul, and is accomplisshed and ended in the life to
come in the everlasting tourmentes of hell. wherefore he byddeth both the
Jews / and strangers, that do profess the Iues law, to fly from such
abominations, and in no case to do them, which things our auncientes greatly
used, and they have polluted our land. And yet now the third time he
commanded the same things, to show that they be not the co^ma^dementes of
man but of god him self. Last of al says he / consider with what words he
does confyrme this present constitution or penal law: Suffer not your self
to be polluted with such vices: for I am your lord god: wyllyng that we all
should be clean from al pollution and syn / for the image and similitude of
god is with in us, and round about us. and as often as we pollute the image of
god by syn, but specially by any of these noughtie and not to be spoken deeds /
that been here forbidden, god must nedis be displeased and angry. And if we keep
this image of god within our soul pure and clean / god has such delight and
pleasure therein, that he vouchith saufe to inhabit within us. Therefore who so
ever does defyle the temple or church of god, god shall distroy him. For the
temple or church of god is holy which church or temple you be, says Paul
to al christen folk. Ageyn Isichius says a little after / It is in very deed,
quod he / uncomely and as nigh to the life of brute beasts as can be / for a
man to be married and meddle with his brothers wife / or with any of his kinsmens
wives, namely of them that be nere of blood. wherefore god commands and
decrees, that he which marieth of this facion shall die without children.
Doutles because that he misusing him self does mar and confound / and
utterly disorder the law of bringing forth children. And again afterward
says Isichius / These things be not spoken of only to the Iues / which by
cause they be circumcised and have Moses law / think them self alone from al
other nations, but they be spoken to every man woman and child which intend
to serve god.

And to this place we have rehearsed you Isichius words. Now with all these
doctors opinion agrees saint Ambrose, saint Hierome, and saint Augustine.
First where one Pattern had a son by one woman, and a daughter by another,
which had also a daughter, and would have married his daughters daughter to his
son / the maidens half uncle, he counseled saint Ambrose in the case /
which made him this answer: I another think nor judge, that your bishop / an
holy man, does look after my sentence and judgment in this matter. For if he
had, he would have written to me of it / and in somoche as he wrytteth not, he
shows plainly / that he judges this no matter to be doubted on. for what
doubt may be in this case, whether thy son, and thy daughters daughter, or
thy nece by thin own daughter, may mary to gethers? seeing the law of god
forbyddeth, that thy son should mary with thy brothers daughter. But first
let us examine the words of the law. for thou p^te^dest in thy letters / that
by this law of god, marriage between such pledges or childerne / as thin be /
is suffered, sins that it is not forbidden. And I sey plainly / that it is
forbidden. For sithins that those things / which be not so grievous vices, be
forbidden, as that we said of brother children, much more this, I think, is
forbidden / where is much nerer kynred. For he that byndeth us to flee the
lesser / does not set us at liberty for the greatter sin, but byndeth us
the more. Than if thou think it is permised for this / because it is not
forbidden specially and expressly, and by name, no more thou shall not find
this thing / forbidden by the words of the law / that the father should not
take his daughter to wife. And is it lauful therefore, by cause it is not
forbidden? ye nothing so. It is forbidden by the rycht of nature / it is
forbidden by the law, that is in every man's heart and conscience / it is
forbidden by love and charity, which by long usage and custom / by continuance
and process of time, has gotten this thing by p^scription / which forsooth is
not to be broken / it is forbidden by title and richt of nigh kindred. how many
such great things shall thou find not forbidden expressly by the law / that
Moses made? and yet the same be forbidden by a certain plain express
commandment of nature. ye and again how many things be there, which are
lefull to do, and yet not expedient? All things be leful, but al things do
not bylde and edify. That if the apostoll does call us back from those
things / that do not edify / how can we trow, that such a thing is to be
done, that is not lefull by the saying of the law / nor yet does not edifye,
by cause the order of pity love and charity is against it, and it against
the order of love and charity? For what is more solemn, or more customably
and reverently observed, than the charitable kiss between the uncle and the
nece / which he owes to her of duty, as to his daughter, and she to him /
as to her father? Shall thou then go and make this innocent kiss of love and
charity, in the which is none offense nor suspycion of evil, to be suspecte,
while thou do intend such marriage? And will thou take aweye from thy dear
pledges or childerne so devout and religious a sacrement and holy token of pure
and natural love? And beside all this / what a great confusyon of other words
should there be? thou one man shall be called of one woman graundefather and
father in law. She also shall be called of the by contrary names / as nees
and daughter in law. Also the brother and sister shall borow contrary names.
For she shall be her brothers mother in law / and he shall be son in law to
his sister. Shall the nece be married unto her uncle or mothers brother? and
shall the pure love and charity of thyn innocent children be turned in to
lusty and carnal love? But though thou suffer the commandment of god go by
/ at the leest wise thou should have regarded the commandments of the
Emperors, of whom thou haste had great honor and preferment. For Theodos
the emperor forbadde the brothers and the sister children to comme to gether
in the way of matrimonye, and has establysshedde very sore punisshment, if
any person be so bold to disteyne the brethers dear gages / and yet brothers
chylderne be in equalle degree / nor the one is not superyour / or as it were
parent unto the the other / as in thy children / where the uncle should mary his
nece. By cause brether childerne be in a manner brethren and sistern / coming
al of one parents / if it were for nothing else / yet for the reverence / that
they owe to the same pare^tes, the Emperor would have them abstain from
marieng the one with the other. If thou say, that it has been dispensedde with
all by god: and though it has / yet is this no p^iudice or president unto the
law. For that statute, that is made in commune and generally for all, if it be
releassed / it helps him only / to whom it appears to be releassed / and
none other. And though we read in the old testament, that some man called his
sister wife, yet this was never hard / that any man should take his nece to
his wife, and should call her his mate. Now furthermore / that is the gayest
thing of all, where thou denyeste, that thy nece is nere of kyn unto her uncle
thy son, by cause she is not of kynne unto him by agnation, or by her fathers
side, but only by cognation / or by her mothers side / as who says, that
belly brotherne, that is / they that be gotten of diverse fathers / and of one
mother, might make a marriage / and yet these persons be not of kynne by the
fathers side, but only by the mother side. wherefore no remedi thou must go from
this intent and purpose / which and if thou might atteyne, yet should it
never increace thy family or lineage.

The second doctor, that we mencionid, is saint Hierome, which writes thus:
what kyn thing is this / that Abraham a just and a good man took his fathers
daughter to wife? seeing that the first men, which were Adams children / though
they did so in deed, yet for the holiness of men's ears the scripture does not
express it / but wylleth it rather to be understood than spoken, the thing
is so abominable. And saying ageyn that god afterward ordained a law for it,
wherein he threteth / that who so shall take his sister, other on father side /
or on mothers side, and shall se her foulenes, it is a rebuke and shame, he
shall be driven out of his country in sight of his own kynne / he has
vnhilled the priuities of his sister, he shall receive his reward for his sin.
This saint Hierome speaks* as if he would say / that this Leuitical law, that
a man should not marye his sister, is so grounded on natural reason, that not
only Abraham ought to have kept this law / and that before it was publysshed
in writing / but also as many as profess the same faith / believe and trust
in god / that Abraham had / and that all faithfuls in Christ ought to have.
Last of all saint Augustine where he goth about to confound and over come
Faustus, that sore enemy to Christ's faith / which leyde it for a foul
vice and punysshable, that christian men at that time would another admit nor
yet abide to here the law of Deuteronomi ones to be spoken on, that a man
might mary his brothers wydowe his brother being dead without children,
aunswerethe to Faustus on this manner. Certain laws of the books of the old
testament we do not keep now a days, because such laws were made only to
be a shadow of things that should follow. And these laws though they were
convenient, and fit to be commanded and suffered for that people / and for
that time / yet we now a days that be christian people, ought not to keep
them bodily or as the bare letter and words does speak: but we must consider
/ what they sygnifye / and we be tought by the apostels own wrytynges that we
must keep such laws spiritually not corporally. for when we read any such
things in the instrument of the old testamente / which in the new testament
we other be not commanded to keep or utterly forbid to keep them / we must not
rebuke it, but we must seek out / what is the gostly meaning of it. For in so
much as we do no more observe it / that proves not, that it is damned, and in
no wise to be received / but that it is fulfilled. And therefore this same self
thing / that Faustus, because he does not understand it / has laid
against christian men, as a crime and grievous offense: serves for nothing
else in the world, but only to show mistycally under a figure and cloud a
spiritual purpose / and it is this / that every preachour of the godspell is
bound so to labor in the godspell / that he stir up sede unto his brother
departed / that is to Christ, which dyed for us. And the sede that shall be
stirred up, must have the name of the brother, that is departed. wherefore we
be called Christians / and therefore without doubt, we now be bound to keep
and fulfill this law, not carnally by bodily generation / after the old
meaning and taking of it / but spiritually / and by gostly generation, and
after the true understanding. And for this saint Paul the apostell
fulfylleth this law spiritually / where he is angrye with them / whom he
says him self to have engendered and gotten through the godspell and the
word of god to Christ Jesus his brother, and not to him self / nor to none
other man. And therefore does sharply blame and rebuke them / which would be
called Paulins, or Paulis men. what, says he, was Paul crucified for you? or
were you baptized in the name of Paul? as if he had said / I begat you to my
brother / which is deed, that is, to Christ. Be you called therefore
Christians / Christ's men, not Paulins or Paulis men.

Again / in his book of questions upon the Leuiticall / and in that work also
/ that he named the Myrror, he says, that this forbod, that a man should not
marie his brothers wife / and al other thingis, that be forbid in the.xviij.
chap. of the Leuiticall / we be bound without doubt to keep them now, in the
time of the new testament and law of the gospel, when the obseruaunce and
keeping of the old shadows / and bodily or outward tokens is taken away* For
what soever thing, as he says in an other place / does help and serve for
vtue and good manners / likewise as they were not ordined to betoke^ any thing
/ but to show us how we must live: so they ought not by any interpretation
or understanding, be applied to any signifyinge or tokenynge, as if they were
but signs and tokens of things. But as many as be of Christ's religion and
believe / be bound of necessity to keep them, even so as they be spoken.

And in an other place he says / Although in time paste men married their
sisters / yet that thing was done because necessite compelled me^ unto it / for
as much as tha^ were so few people: but this thing is not so old / nor was
never so necessary / but it is now as damnable / because that religion does
forbid it. For it ought to be done than / when it might / because that by
marie^ge of sisters there might be plenty of women, and so that by process
they might take wives / which should not be their sisters. but afterward ones
that this necessite ceased, and that there were women inoughe, this thing
ought not only to be undone / but if it were done, it should be a crime not
to be spoken. For I wot not how / says he / there is among all the points
of man's shamefacidnes one certain natural and commendable point, and it is
this, that to what so ever woman we be bound to do honor with reverence and
shamefacidnes / our carnal lust / yea though it be for generation / yet by
cause it is carnal lust / we refrain it from that woman, specially
considering that we se married folk / namely that have shame and honesty / to
be ashamed of such lust. Now here thou see / gentle indifferent reder,
what is the judgment of these great diuinis: wherein thou shalt call to thy
remembrance.iiij. or.v. things.

First what so ever person of Christ's believe break any of these Leuiticall
prohibitions of marriage, he shall be damned both body and soul in to
everlasting death of hell. Second that not only the Iues did abstain from
marienge their brothers wives / even as ye would say / for fear of some
mischief, and yet they might have done it by auctorite of their law, but
that the very heathens also after the death of their wives, did ever more
absteyne from maryinge of their wives sisterne / as from a certain impiety or
abhominacion against nature. Third, that marriages contracte contrary to these
prohibitions / be uncomely and abhomynable, and as nere as can be to the life
of brute beasts / and such as christian people should another abide to here
them spoken of, nor yet to think on them, and that they be clean contrary to
charity, ye and furthermore that they be the transgression and breking of all
the law. Fourth / that they be so grievous and so hateful in the sight of god,
that they have distroyed hole nations / polluted the land, and being polluted
/ caused hit naturally to grudge and to put them out, which had co^mised such
things / doutles because that god did take vengeance at the grefe and
complaynt of the land. Finally that these prohibitions perteyne not only unto
the Iues / but to all christians, which come to serve god: and that they /
which be polluted and corrupt with any one of these not to be spoken deeds,
is defiled with them all / and that god is angry with them, and will not dwell
with them, and contrary that the spirit of god dwells in them / that keep
them self clean from such foul couples. And seeing that these foresaid
things be true, it is provided as plainly as can be / that these Leuitical
laws be, out of doubt / the co^mandementes of god / and that / moral
co^mandementes / ordined for thincrease and mayntenaunce of honesty* and
virtue, and that they must not be kept after a spiritual and a mystical
understanding, as Isichius says, more than after the plain letter, and even
as they be spoken, namely among christian folk. For as many as be true
Christ's disciples / the spirit of god dwells in them / and if there be any
/ that has not the spirit of Christ, he is none of Christ's. And therefore
christian people specially had need to be holy, and not to suspe^de the temple
or church of god with such abominations, or any other vice: but it becomes
them to be innocent from all manner of foulenes and uncleanliness. And mark well
this thing also / gentle indifferent reder, that saint Ambrose holds, that
it is no doubt, and without question forbidden / any manne to marye his half
systers daughter, and that for many consyderations, as for the increase or
multyplyenge of stocks / or by cause of religion and reverence, that is in the
names of kynrede: which to be changed / or to be confounded by the mean of
uncleanly love / he judges it a thing not to be spoken: or else because these
maryages be forbidden both by the law of nature / and so much more by the
law of god: or else because such couples be not convenient nor sitting, for
as much as the order of natural love or reverence is against hit: and also
because that most religious and devout sacrament, and charytable kiss / the
which is without offense / that the uncle does owe unto his nece, as to his
daughter, and she to her uncle, as to her father, should by such maryages be
taken away: or finally because that such marriages be forbidden even by the
law of man, as by the law Ciuille. How much more thanne ought we to
think, that we should make no such maryages / as be before forbidden in the
Leuiticall? the which as they be full of bonds / of far more nere kynrede
thanne this, so is there more foulness and malyciousnesse in the doing of
them, and they let more the multiplyenge of stocks / and they confound more
the religion and reverence of the names of kynred / and they be also much more
unlawful / because they be forbidden both by the express commandment of god
/ publisshed by the mouth of Moses, and also prohibit by the law of nature,
and beside this / they let the increase of love and charity a great deal
more, and be against natural reverence and shamefacidnes, and for a
conclusion, they be forbidden and interdicte not only by the law Civil, but
also by the holy canons and rules of the sacre holy church / such no doubt
as were indicted and commanded by the holy spirit of god, which has the
orderinge and thadministration of the church of god.

The fourth Chaptre.
ANd now after that we have rehearsed the doctors of the church of Christ,
which be of most great auctorite / fame / and renown: let us come to the
writings of the other expou^ders and interpreters of scripture / which though
they be not of so great authority / yet for all that their credence and
learning is both received and judged to be of gravity.

Truly saint Ancelme, sometime archebysshoppe of Caunturbury / when one asked
him / by what reason the forbydding / that we should not mary any of our
consanguinite or affinite, has so great strength and power in the church of
god / that there can be no perdon or dispensatio^ for the brekynge of it,
except that the marriage first be broken, he answered thus, because / says he
/ I se the here seek and demand not only the authority, as I might say,
compellynge and constraynynge only by force and power / but rather to seek a
reason, proving and showing unto the this thing by reason: by cause thou
shalt know / that I will satisfy and fulfill thy will and desire / all be it
perauenture I am not able / yet I will endeuer my self to content the somewhat
in this behalf. The canons and laws of the church be full of this
commandment / and there be many decrees of the old fathers also / that we
should not mari with any of our bloudde / or if we have married, that we should
be departed and disceuered again. And as for the cause or reason of this
commandment, al be it I might say / that the simple and plain reason is / to
obey the power and authority of them, to whom Christ said: It is not you your
self truly that do speak, but the spirit of your father, which speaks in
you / and to follow the custom of the holy church, whose customs to break
and fordo is a kind of heresy: yet for all that by the consyderation and
marking also of holy scripture I am wont to think thus with my self. Among
the old and ancient people of the Iues / it was not leful for any person to
mary with any out of his trybe. And when I doubted, and sought a reason / why
so: the daughters of Salphaad came to my remembrance. For whose marriages /
when certain of their trybe and kynred did ask counsel of Moses, and by
Moses, of our lord: commandment was given them of our lord, that there should
be no marriages made out of one tribe into a another, which was ordined /
because the inheritance of the tribes should not be diminysshed. For that
carnal people could not lift up their hearts to heaven, but as an erthely
crepynge beast, with all their breast and heart fast cleaving to the earth,
thought only of the erthely heritage / and not of the heavenly. Therefore every
tribe had leauer to keep their self within the straites of their tribe, by
maryenge to gether one of the self same tribe with an other / then by marienge
out of their stock, to diuyde and part out also their heritage. for such was
their heritage / and such is all erthely heritage / that if hit be ones
diuyded / it waxes less and dimynissheth / nor can not come all holle to
many. Therefore, as our lord him self in the gospel says to the Iues, that
Moses did suffer them for their ungracious stomakes and hard hearts, to put
away their wives / so that they put in a bill of divorce: euin so in this case
Moses gave an answer to their carnalites and fleshli desires, and acording to
their stubborn and hard hearts, that they should not mary out of their tribe:
but the goodness and perfectnes of us / that be christian folk, is not on this
facion. For seeing that our heritage is god / of whom hit is spoken, God is love
and charity, like wise as the Iues used a law fit and agreeable to their
heritage, so we ought to mai^tein a law for our heritage / which is the law
of love and charity. For as for love and charity the brodder it is spredde,
the more remains to him, that does spredde and cast it abroad / and the more
his love and charity does increace. Therefore the christian religion and
perfection has ordined, that the bounds and buttayles of consanguynite should
be stretched forth unto the.vj. degree on every side, according to the
decrees of holy fathers and canons: so that kynsfolke being within the.vi.
degree, may not marye to gether / between whom their own natural affection of
one to a another should be sufficient to fortifye and make strong love and
charity between them, the which natural affection it is great sin to violate
and break / even among the hethen and unchristian people. And where that this
natural affection and love begins to fail, there only must be put to /
the bond of marriage / for to bind love and charity to gether agein / that it
slyp not away, to enlarge the bounds and buttayles of our heritage, which is
love and charity. And it seems most right and reasonable, that as among the
Jews the transgressour of their law was punisshed accordyngely / for marienge
out of their tribe and kindred / for to conserve their erthely heritage: so
among us christian people it is right and reasonable / that the tra^sgressor of
our law be punisshed, to the intent our heavenly country and godly heritage may
be increased. Yet an other reason. As they were forbidden to marye out of thayr
trybe or stock, even so they were forbidden by the self same law to meddle
with them, that were next of their bloudde. For the law says: No man meddle
with her, that is next of his bloudde: and the law puts unto / the
authority of the commander / saying / I the lord: and as though they had
required a cause and a reasone why it was so commanded / the law puts unto
/ Thou shall not open and dyscouer thy fathers foulnes nor thy mothers / by
cause it is the foulnes or fylthines of thy father and thy mother. And
afterward straight following he reakenneth up in order those / that be next
of bloudde, with whom we must not meddle / nor open or discover their foulnes /
that is to wit, brotherne and systerne / and other that be there described.
The which cause and reasone may be also commune unto us / and to them / even
like as the commandment is common both unto us / and to them. Therefore let
us seek what foulnes is this, which who so discovers and openneth / is
wourthy to die for it. It is a foul thing / when one part does not agree with
the other. And before the transgression of the first man Adam, in all man's
body there was no thing foul fylthy or unclean, no party contrary nor
rebellious to a another. For while that same harmony and sweet agreement / well
and commely proporcioned, by the hand of the creator and maker god, did yet
remain: one party did agree with an other and the soul was subject and
obedient to god / and the body was subject and obedient to the soul in all
points. But after that by breaking of the commandment of god / the soul
was made inobedyent and stubborn and rebellious against god his superior /
the body inferior was no longer obedient to the soul his superior. For
straight the tra^sgressours / Adam and Eve, had their eyes opened. And their
eyes, says he, were opened / that is to be understand the one to have carnal
lust unto the the other / the which desire and lust before they had not. And
where as they before were naked / and were not a whit ashamed thereof /
streyghte when they saw that the parts of their bodies were turned in to
things to be ashamed of, went about to hyde and cover them / and did make
covering for them. The which thing we may perceive even now in children
and little babes, which as long as they feel / nor perceive no stirrynge nor
motion of concupiscence or flesshely lusts / they have no partis that they be
ashamed of / because they can not be ashamed of any part of their bodies. But
when they begin ones to perceive and feel that concupiscence / they can not
suffer their priuities to be uncovered. Therefore after this harmoni and sweet
agreement was broken and undone in our first parents / there happened not a
little foulenes and original punysshement / that should go with original
sin / from them to their posterity, and to all that should come of them. And
so by cause of this foul bodily lust and concupiscence, that Paul calls
the body of sin / which is within our body / those members and parts / that
have ones served to this lust and concupiscence / be named shameful parts,
foulness / and shame, by cause they be of knowledge / and do witness of our
inward foulenes / that is to sey / of our lust and stirynge to fleshely
medlynge: which members ever more do require to be always covered and hyd. And
this foulenes of concupisce^ce, desire, and lust is then opened or vncouerd /
wha^ it requires and takes unto it the office and service of tho members /
that be ordyned for it, and does fall to practice / at which time all that
might and power of the reasonable soul or of man's wit is so dulled / so
troubled / and so overcome / and so oppressed / and ouerlaide by the filthy
lust of the flesh, that it may be very well said at that time: Adam / where
art thou? That is to say / thou that would have been like to god / I do not
se whereto thou art come. And what is more foul than this foulenes? what
greatter shame is there than this shame? The which the apostel rebukynge, Fly
you, says he, fornication. All the sin, that a man does commit, is without
the body, but he that synneth in fornication, synneth against his own body,
that is to sey, all synnis truly hurts the soul, but yet for all that they
foul not the body: but he, that commits fornication / does not only offend
god / and foul his soul / but also he defylethe and makes dishonest all the
fayrnesse and goodlines of his body. For as a thief, wha^ he is taken / has a
mark bourned in him with an iron or with fire / to his vttre and everlasting
shame and rebuke, so this bodily pleasure was for a punysshement of sin put
into our nature / which nature by the fault of brekyng gods commandment was
now holly corrupt through and through in every part of it, because that he,
in whom al our holle nature was, and without whom there was no part of it /
was al holle corrupt. The which foulenes in all persons ought to be covered
ever more with the coueryng of shamfacidnes, if it were not necessary for the
generation of man, for a pain and punysshement of the first sin. And yet
there is no such love to the generation and encrese of man / that does suffer
us to discover this foulenes in those persons / of whom the law says, that
they be next of our bloudde. For these persons by the law and motion of nature
self owe this reverence of love and charity one of them to an other, so that
there can be no just and lauful cause why they should shame and dishoneste
their bodies on this facion / nor there can be no honest excuse found or
brought in / which may cover and hyde this dishonestie. Not because I would
sey / that marriages he not holy, and that the bed is not clean and without
spotte and sin, in the which matrimony is kept laufully, with fear of god
/ and for charytable love and honestye. For by such matrymonye they that mary
/ be made one spirit and one soul, syns that they be made now one flesh.
And thus both by their honest love / and also by their desire to engendre and
get children, do so hyde and cover their dishonestie, and do, as ye would sey
denoure and swalowe up this penal foulenes and filthiness of man's generation,
that as the Apostell says: They, that mary / be as though they were not
married. Therefore, as we have said, they that were forbidden to mary out of
their tribe: by the same law also were forbidden to meddle and mary with them
/ that be next of their blood. But among the Jews this law of natural love
and affection scant did pass the third degree of consanguinite, but among us
(unto whom the time of correctyon and amendment is come, by whom god has
corrected and amended the world / and brought it to perfection, which shall
not be changed) love has grown and encressed, and honesty greatly abou^ded
and multiplied / and for to be token and declare the perfection of the gospel,
that nombre of 3. is doubled / and has extend it self in to.6. which is a
perfect nombre, and stondith by his own parts / even as the truth of the
gospel stondeth by it self alone / and needs nothing else to underset and
stay it up. But here thou will leye to my charge and say / that there were in
the old time certain good and vtuos men, which for certain honest causes did
presume and adventure to break and disteine even the first and second degree of
co^sa^guinite, as before the law did Abraham / Isaac / and Jacob / which
lately before had been disseuered and commanded to go aparte from other nations
/ for auoidinge the couplinge and marriage with the same nations, and so did
mary with them, that were next of their blood / and this was done before the
law was given / and after that the law was given Caleb gave Axam his daughter
in wife to his younger brother Othoniel, for a reward of victory, when he
conquered and overcame the cite of Letters. And also Thamar king David's
daughter / when she was oppressed of her brother, Do not brother, said she, but
ask me of the king my father / and he will not deny the. The which king David
truly / that was said to give the sister to her brother in wife / was father to
them both. wherefore where as I say they did presume upon some certain honest
causes and consyderations, that chaunsed, yet for all that christian religion
and the perfectnes that ought to be in a christian man / will judge nothing to
be honest, that is against the honesty of nature. Lo here thou haste my mind,
and what I think in this question of thine, says saint Ancelme, If thou be
pleased and contented / it is well: if it displease the, I shall lightly get
forgeuenes and perdon of the. In this opinion also be Hugh Cardinal, Raufe
Flauiacensis / Ruperte Tuitiensis / Hildebart Cenomanense / Iuo Carnotense all
bishops / and one water of Constance / archedeacon of Oxeforthe. And trewely
the first two Hugh Cardinal and Raufe Flauiacense / expoundinge the.xviij.
chaptre of the Leuiticall / show how that chaptre does hang with tho
things / that go before. Many mystical things, say they, hitherto the law
has given to the old people of the Iues to observe and keep / wherein only
was a shadow of our faith and manners / and not the very truth in deed: and as
for here the law instructs and teaches the people, and gives them mo
precepts, whereby they may know what belongs to good manners, to virtue, and
honesty. For those things, that follow here, must be even so understood /
as they be spoken, wherewith the people / which had now betaken them self to
an other lord and master, is informed and taught / to the intent / that they
for their little power / should endeuer them self to do some good / nor
should not be content with the heuye bourdon of bondage / and to be underneath
sacreme^tes, or signs and tokens of sacre and holy things / the which should
signify and betoken justice and goodness, not in them self, but in other men.
Even like wise as if a Currour or post should carye any kings letters into
far countries, by the which he shall show other, what they shall do, and yet
he shall not do the same him self. And this same Flauiacense a litell after,
says thus. Al though, says he, that these marriages here forbidden in forne
years at the beginning of the world had a certain facion of their holiness /
nevertheless because in process of time the virtue of continence and chastity,
and refraynynge of bodily lust and pleasure / was to be promoted, set
forward, and increased / and the license and liberty of marriage to be
restrained more straytely, and not so at large as it was wont: this Leuiticall
law was made to forbid such maryages between them that be nygh of kyn and of
affinite / for the encreasse of honesty and virtue, because that it was more
comely to absteyne from such maryages. And who so ever after this gods forbod
/ presume to enterprise any such marriage, he is a transgressor of the law /
and does ron in to the abominable crime and syn of incest. Forther more Rupert
also, If thou ask, says he, which be those uncleanly beasts, spoken of in
the old testament / that god does hate, they be these, you shall not do after
the custom and manner of the land of Egypt / where as you have dwelled / nor
after the custom and usage of the country of Chanaan, into the which I shall
bring you. And afterward he shows their customs, saying: No man come nygh
to her / that is next of his bloudde. For these verily be the uncleanly beasts
/ these be the caroginous and stynkinge beasts, which the people of god is
bound not to eat / that is / not to admit them in to their company. For all
those persons, that do such things / that commit such uncleanly and
unreasonable and beastly vices, that discover the foulenes or preuities of their
mother, or father, that discover the shame of their sister, other by the
fathers side, or by the mothers side / those men I say / that do these
things, and in any manner of mean discover the foulnes of their kynsfolke, and
do uncover the foulenes or priuities of a woman, that has the flowers: that
have a do with their neighbors wife / that give of their sede unto the image
of Moloche / and do translate it unto him by fire: these, and al such other
workers of wickedness, be defiled and unclean, unto whom nothing is clean. For
these things / according to the true saying of the gospel / do defyle and
pollute the man. For that, that comes into the mouth / as meat and drink /
does not defyle or pollute a man. And we waste no time in these forbiddinges,
that be here rehearsed / to search out the depenes and profoundnes of mystical
meaninges or under standynges of these words. for they be plainly just and
rightwise: and the reason why they be so / is open and plain at every man's eye
/ and easy to se / by cause they do bring great rest and quietness of
conscience to the herers / but rather I should have said / to the doers and the
folowers. More over Hugh of saint Victore says thus. The first time, when god
did make marriage, he did forbydde us only to contracte matrimony with.ij.
persons, that is the father and the mother. afterward when he ordined marriage
/ the second time / which was done by the law, he did except certain other
persons / both because nature showed us / that it was comely so to be / and
also for the increase of shamefacidnes and chastity. Therefore I think / that
except these foresaid marriages / where in needs regard of shamefacidnes and
chastity to be had, because of the horriblenes and foulenes of the same: that
in all other if any man by ignorance and unwittingly by chance offend in any
woman / as long as he does not know it, no man can deny, but hit shall be
called a lefull marriage, if that it be lefully done after the determination of
the church: so that I except evermore all such maryages, in the which we
must needs have regard of shamefacidnes and chastity. Therefore let no man
obiecte unto me the marriages bitwene brethren and systerne, or any such
other, with whom if any person do mary ignorantly and vnwittyngly / this
ignorance can not excuse them, in that thing that they do. These be horrible
and terrible, and no reasonable nor excusable deeds / in the which though there
be any thing done by ignorance, yet for all that shamefastnes and chastity is
disteyned and lost. Beside all this saint Hildebart, sometime the bishop
Cenomanense / in a certain epistle to the Archebisshoppe of Roan writes under
this manner. As your letter shows, waters daughter of Meduan / which is
married to the cou^tie of Moriton, men say that she is very nygh of bloudde
unto him, and before that the forsayde persons were married to gethers, water
secretly came and told me of the kynred between them / and craftly did ask
me counsel / what I thought in it. He thought it very good, he said / if
love and charity, that should come by this marriage might cease the war, that
the Earl had cruelly made against him of long contynuaunce. He said more over
/ that you and other prelates of your province / had a certayned him by
writynge / that this abomination of kynred might be suffered / for this intent,
that he, the Earl, which had been long at war might come to peace and
quietness / whereupon he desired also the consent of our church Cenomanense /
unto the marriage that was then to come, that by the auctorite of that church
also / he might stablysshe and make sure his daughters marriage / if that at
any time it should fortune a divorce to be sued against her: but he could in no
meanis make me to agree to it, nor I could in no wise perfectly believe, that
your wisdom had fallen into the symplenes or vndiscretenes of them, whom the
apostoll does rebuke / by cause they sey / Let us do noughtly, that thereof may
come good. And therefore, as for my part / I was ware and circumspecte. He
required my consent: and I sent him word / that I would never agree unto it,
nor would not suffer / for regard or consyderation of any cause of
dyspensation that could be, persons of kynred or affinity to contracte
unlawful and forbidden marriage. And it shall be long to his cure and charge into
whose parisshe or diocese it is known, that this woman is departed / to
withsto^d and be against this marriage / even until it be divorced.

Again the same Hildebart was ones asked of the bisshoppe Sagie^se / and of an
other certain Archidiacon / if two were spousyd and hand fast to gether, and
the one of them dyed, whether the person alive may enter matrymony with the
sister or brother of the dead? he answered on this wise: If crede^ce be to be
given to me^ of auctorite / marriage is made by consent, not by myngynge of
bodies. wherefore saint Ambrose says / She that is despoused / or has made
promise unto the man / has taken the name of a yoked or married woman. For
as soon as she does yoke her self by promise unto the man / and he to her
again: then this promys of both sides takes the name of yokinge or marriage,
not when the man knows her, by having to do with her. For it is not the
taking a weye of the flower or beutie of the womans virginite, that makes the
yocke, but the bargayne, agreement, and consent to be yoked. For when the woman
is yoked by her promise or is handfast, then is the yokynge or marriage, not
when the man does know her by having to do with her. Furthermore Isodore
writes: They be called more truly yoked to gether / for the first faith and
promise of spousage, all though they be ignorant of medlynge to gether. Also
Nicolas writing to the bisshoppe Higmare. The only consent, says he, between
them / of whose marriage thou doutest / is sufficient by the law. The which
consent alonely if it lack in marriage / than all that ever is done besides
forth, is of none effect, yea though they have had to do to gether / as John^
Chrysostom / the great doctor / does witness, which says, VVIL, makes
marriage / and not medlynge to gether. And therefore it is written in the Civil
law in the book of the constitutions. If a man upon affection and mind to
marye lead a woman home to his house before there be any wrytynges made of the
dowery / that he shall have with her, let him not be so bold to divorce her
from him / tylle he has showed a laufull cause of divorce. These things,
says Hildebert / if thou had diligently considered / forsooth this maiden
should not have entered marriage with that man, unto whose brother she was
coupled before by solenne marriage, and was joined unto him by consent, all
though death, not looked for, did let the secresis of marriage. For who so ever
do contracte such matrymonie / in no case can be suffered by any dispensation /
but must be punisshed by the rule of justice and right. And of such marriages
as these be, thou shalt find in the counsel Triburiense. A man was handfast
to a woman, with whom he could not have the secrets of marriage: that same
woman / his brother did privily defyle and get with child. It was decreed
and determined / that how be it she could not be married to the brother, that
was her leful husband / yet for all that the other brother, that had got her
with child, can not have her / because she had made promise before to his
brother: but both he and she / that have committed adultery / let them have the
punysshement of their fornication / and let them not be denied to use lauful
marriage / the man to mary laufully to whom he will / and the woman also. For
our fore fathers / by cause that marriage should be done with honesty / and the
marriage bed without spotte and uncleanness, they have very diligently provided
here before / that a woman / which had made promysse, and was spoused unto the
one brother / could not be married to the other brother: and he that was
confederate, or be trouthed, to one sister / should not mary the the other sister.
For by such liberty and license through the craft and disceite of the devil
/ there might come many dishonest and beastly or incestuous marriages / which be
ceased / all the while that the forbiddinge of the law is observed.

And to the self same purpose, saint Iuo sometime bishop Carnotense, wrote
unto Lesiarde bishop Swessionense. you know well enough, says he, that I never
allowed the marriage between Peter / the son of Geruase / and of Galeranes
daughter of Brutule / and that I never gave counsel / nor did never consent
/ that it should be done. Yea when that Galeran, the maids father cou^sayled
me in this matter / I gave him counsel, by Drogon clerk / utterly to the
contrary, that it should in no wise be done, because that such marriages might
not stand / if there were any / that would break it. I added also the saying
of the law, that one man can not be married to.ij. sisters, likewise as one
woman can not laufully be married to.ij. brothers. For Sinegund / the sister of
this maiden / whom this foresaid Peter has now married, was the same self
Peter's wife, not only made sure and handfaste unto him by promysse / but also
yoked and conjoined by the priests beneson and prayer. And if you lay against
me / that there was no yoking or marriages / where it is well known, there
followed no carnal medlinge between the man and the woman: I answer by the
auctorite of the fathers, that the yocke and marriage can never be undone /
saying there was ones a steadfast conuenant and promise of yoking or marriage
between them. wherefore, as saint Augustine says, the angel said true to
good Joseph: Fear not to take Marye thy wife to the. for he did truly call
her Joseph's wife, whom he had not known by secresye of marriage / nor never
should know. And when he had brought many auctorities of the fathers / to this
purpose, the which were cited before of Hildebarte, It is, says he, a
canonical law, that no man can marie that woman, which has made promise of
marriage to an other man. Nor contrary / if the man that has made promysse,
would be married to an other woman. For both the laws of god and man forbydde
these promysses to be broken. This same saint Iuo also writes to Odon, the
archidiacon. Even from the beginning of the world, said he, the sacrament of
marriage remaynethe still / as of the law of Nature / and in no point broken
nor changed / so that another original sin, or Adams trespass took that away /
nor the judgment of drownyng the world / whereby sins and naughty things
were washed away / did take away or change marriage. Therefore that thing that
is ordyned by the commandment of god / and that god would have to be
unchangeable / ought not be broken by no man's commandment / except the
marriage were made without consent of the parties / or else dampnable of it
self, that is: falsely forged and untrue / or else incestuouse and against
Nature and kind. That if any of those things do chance / there must be no
delay / but such marriages must be healed out of hand by departing and
divorce. Therefore though the king do promise, that he will forgive many
displesures / done unto him, and leave many displeasures / that he intended,
and that he woll do many good things and many plesures, if he may keep still
for a time this woman / which he unlawfully has / and the seat apostolyke to
be content withal, and he to be still in the company of christian men: yet for
all that I say and answer unto you thus / by the auctorite of god and divine
scripture, that it is not possible for him to have forgiveness of his sin /
give he never so much / or do he never so many good deeds in reco^ / pence, as
long as he has will and mind to abide in the same sin, acordynge to the
saying of the appostel: There is none host, sacrifyce / nor amends / nor
forgyuenesse / for the sin of them, that sin wylfully. which in other
words is as much to say / that no person / having will and mind to
continue in his sin / can have forgyuenes of his sin by any manner of alms
/ or by any manner of good deeds, or by any manner of offrynge, or bestowyng of
his goods. wherefore we read that our lord also did answer Cain / wha^ he
offered up his goods, and for all that did intend murder: If thou, said god,
doste offer a right, and doste not divide a right, thou have sinned / Cease
and leave of? as though he had said, thou do sin / by cause thou do not
depart and divide well / which do bring me thy goods, and thi^king upon
murder / do take from me thine own self which art better to me tha^ thy
goods. Her fore also that good Pope Gelasius says. It is not read, syns
Christ's relygion began, nor there can none example begeuen in the church of
god / that this thing was ever done or ever commanded to be done, other of
any bysshoppes, or by the apostels them self, or else by our lord and savior
him self: that any man should be assoiled from his syn / that intended to
co^tynue in the same, and did not fully purpose for ever to forsake and utterly
to renounce / both that and al other sin / or thing that should displese
god. More over the same saint Iuo did write unto Henry king of England / that
would have married his daughter to one Hugh, a kinsma^ of his, answeri^g i^ this
wise. Because it is not comeli, that so noble blood should be steined with so
open i^cest, and that the will and mind of carnal persons should through this
bestly example be encoragid to commit like incest and marriage again nature and
kind: for the reverence, that we have unto you / and true love, that we bear
you, we desire to admonisshe your majesty before / that while you may do it
with your honesty, you suffer no such marriage to be made: lest that such
marriage / saying it is presumed to be against the law, be worthily and of
right broken and undone again by the law. And doubtless it becomes not a
kings majesty to commit any such fault in his own person / the which
ought to be punysshed in other with the rygor and extremite of the law. For
sothe we can in no case swerve from the course and order of the law. If we se
our parisshon / or one of our diocese commit any abomination / specially in
marriage / because of the decree of the seat apostolic: WE reserve no manner
of forgyuenes / no manner of perdon or dispensation for incest marriages / and
such as be against nature and kind, until they have healed their adultery by
departing and divorce. For seeing that we do reverence and fear the power of
temporal kings: much more we are bound to reverence and dred the almighty
power of the ever lasting king. And by this means we may give Caesar / that
is Cesars, and god that is goddis.

And the same saint Iuo answered one Geffrey the earl Vindocinense / desiring
to have to wife Matylde vycountesse of Blois / which was married before to one
Robert / kynsman to the said Geffrey: I command, says he, and by the law
of Christ I forbid the to contract this bestly unkind or unchaste marriages /
which thou can another defend by the law / nor yet be get by them laufull
heirs, that by the law can succeed the.

And he again writes to Damberte / the Archebysshop of Senon / of a knight /
which before laufull marriage with his wife / lay with her sister, and did
confess his fault openly / whereupon saint Iuos words be these. I answer
unto your fatherheed / that thing, which you know well enough / that if he
had brought up an open infamy and sklander / and that against an honest
person / that has deserved no such thing / hereafter he can another accuse
nor yet be witness. But because no man, that is gilty, can make no confession,
except it be of some naughty thing / we can not deny, but we ought to
receive and take such confessions, as they that be penitent or sorye for that
they have myssedone, do make against their own self / for the fear and dread
of god / and for the health of their own souls. nor we deny not also, but that
we ought to i^ioyne them lauful penance / the which if we should deny them /
we should cast them even to the mouth of the invisible wolves to be devoured.
And if we suffer such accusors of them self lightly to pass / and to skape
without punysshement, the goodness and honesty of marriage / which from the
beginning was commanded to be kept holyly / both by nature, and also by
law, we put it perillously in danger to be steined and distroyed. Because
therefore that the end of all strife and controversy / that belongs to the
determinacion of the Church, is an Oath, after the saying of the apostel /
this confession must be confirmed / and proved by several oaths of every
person / and by vi. sufficient and honest persons: the which either were
present, and knew the thing done, or else may by proof of that / that they
believe and think lykely / affirm and uphold the truth. Because that new
kinds of diseases compelle us to seek experience of new medicines. Therefore
wha^ this confession shall be thus confyrmedde and prouedde / than it shall be
open and plain, that this marriage is unchaste, and unkind. And we reserve no
manner of forgyuenesse for unchaste marriages / after the canons, until they
have healed such sinful marriages by departinge and divorce. And he that did
contrary to the laws of matrimony, and did accuse him self, let him abide
unmarried, either for evermore, or at the least til the time that he has
fulfilled his penance. This alweys understand, that the woman, which shall be
divorced from him, lose not her dowere, which is the price of her chastity.
And by this means we shall do al, that his confession requires: and shall make
a profitable and a sufficient provision for the honesty of marriages for the
time to come.

Finally walter of Constance, Archidiacon of Oxforthe, wrote unto the bishop
of Exceter word for word, as here after folowethe. Saying that both great
learning, and also use and experience of matters, has made you wise and
circumspect in judgment and decision of causes, we maruayle, and other also,
which be very well learned in both the laws maruayle / wherefore you have so
long time differred to make a divorce between Roberte and Ismen his kynswoman,
specially seeing that you have express commandment of the Pope for the same,
and seeing that holy Canons do repute and compte it for a damnable and
abominable sin / to suffer such persons to dwell to gether. Trewely there
were brought forth laufull witness, and such as no exception / nor refuse or
challenge can be laid against them: which if they have not made full proof
unto you in this matter / than (as well according to the clause of the Popes
letters / where as he says, you may prove the matter by many other / as also
by authority of Fabian and Celestine / and other holy fathers) you must
admytte them, which after these forsayde men, be most nigh unto you / and of
most sage counsel / that such diligent inquisition and searching out of the
truth may be a lantern to your feate, that you may turn justice into
judgment. For the more abominable and beastly sin that incest is, so much
the more scrupulouse and curious you must be / to find out the certeinte of
this kynrede: so that in making the divorce, the iuges sentence do not waver
or hang doutfull. It is not leful for a judge in this matter to dissemble or to
use any cloak or color / and to make as he did not know that thing, that he
knows in such a matter / wherein stondethe the peril of men's souls. More
over there is one thing in this matter / that troubles us above al. For where
as the said Robert is mine eldest brothers eldest son / and because that all the
progeny of our stock does hang upon him, as of the heed / by reason of his
father: we fear least this sin of inceste or unchaste marriage should pass
from him into his posterite / and to all that ever should come of him. For all
the holle succession and generation shall receive and take corruption and
infection / if the members come not laufully and without corruption from the
heed: if the rivers come not pure from the spryng / and the branches without
corruption from the body of the tree / as holy scripture also does witness,
saying: The childerne of inceste persons be abominable before god. And as
saint Gregorye does plainly say, There comes no laufull nor good issue of
unchaste or inceste and unkind medlinge to getheer.

Now for to come also to the scole doctors / which do uphold and maintain
both with great nombre / and great consent / this judgment of these forsaid
fathers, upon the Leuiticall prohibitio^s. Forsothe saint Thomas says. In
co^uersacion of persons, that be of kynrede or of affinite, we find that there
should be no venereous medlyng, for.iii. resons. And first because that
naturally a man owes a certain honor and reverence / and fear to his
parents, and therefore also unto other of his kyn, which come very nigh of the
same parents. In so much that in old time, as Valerius Maximus shows, hit
was not leful for the son to baath in one place with his fader / lest they
should se each other naked. And it is manifest, that in venereous dedis / there
is a certain foul use of meddling and homelynes / which is contrary to
honor and reverence. wherefore men do blusshe and be asshamed of such deeds.
And therefore it is uncomely, that there should be any such wantonne medlynge
between such persons. And this reason semethe to be expressed in the xviij.
chapitre of the Leuiticall / where it is said: She is thy mother / thou shalt
not uncover her foulenes or priueties. And the same self thing is said there
also afterward on other persons. The second reason is, bybause persons
that be of one bloudde / must needs be conversant and in company to gether.
wherefore if such persons should not be forbidden to use such wanton pastimes
/ one with an other / men should have to much oportunite and occasion to use
such lustful intermedlyng. And so the stomakes of men should be out of
courage, and their hearts cowardelike, and as it were womans hearts, by the
means of lechery and beastly pleasure of the body. And therefore in the old
Leuitical law, those persons seem specially to be forbidden marriage, which
must needs dwell to gether. The third reason is / because that by such
marriages / should be lettedde the multyplyenge and increace of friendship. For
when a man does take a wife / that is a stranger to him / all the kynsfolke
of his wife be knytte unto him by certain frendeshyppe and love / as if they
were his own kynsfolke. wherefore Augustine says, There was very great regard
taken of love and charity / and that according to right and reason, to the
intent that men, unto whom love and concord is both profitable and also
honest / should be knytte to gether by sundry degrees of kynred. And that one
man should not have many / but sundry to be disseuered in sundry persons. And
Aristotell, an heathen man / in the.ij. book of the politikes, puts to,
the.iiij. reason / because that where a man does love his kinswoman by Nature /
if there should be put to the love that comethe of bodily medlynge / there
should be to much heat and feruentnes of love / and to great a provocation of
flesshly lust, which is contrary to the chastity of marriage / where such
pastime is to be used for necessity, and not for pleasure. Thus says saint
Thomas here. And in an other place he says thus, That thing in marriage / is
clean contrary to the law of nature, whereby matrimony comes not unto the
end / which it was ordyned for / by convenient means. And the chief and
first end of marriage of it self, is the good or benyfite of issue / the
which doubtless by some certain degrees of kynrede is let / as between the
father and the daughter, the mother and the son, not because that issue here
is utterly taken a way, (for the daughter may have issue of her fathers sede,
and nourysshe it up with the father / and teach and instruct it, in the
which thing stondeth the benifite of issue) but by cause that this end of
marriage, that is to have issue and children, can not be brought to pass in
this case by any lefull and honest manner. For it is against all good order and
reason / that the daughter should be coupled by marriage with her own fader / to
be his companion to bring him forth children / and to bring them up, saying
that she ought to be subject to her father in all things, as that does come
of him, and has her being of him / and therefore by the law of nature hit is
forbidden, that any person should marie father or mother / and yet more with
the mother, than with the father, by cause that hit is more contrary to the
honor and reverence / that is due unto the parents, if the son take his
mother to wife / than if the father should take his daughter to his wife, because
that the wife is bound by the commandment of god / to be subject and
obedient unto her husband.

But the second end of marriage is repressynge and quenchinge of bodily lust,
and concupiscence / which restraint of carnal lust / though it be not the
first and chief end of marriage / but the second / yet of it self it is an
end of marriage. And this end also should perysshe and be lost / if a man
might marye which of his kynswomen he would. For there should be opened a
great wycket unto lusts of the body / except there were some restraint / and
flesshly meddling forbidden among those persons, which must needs be
conuersaunt to gether in one house. And therefore the law of god has not only
forbidden marriage with the father and the mother, but also with other persons /
that be of our kynred, which must needs company to gethers / and are bound
to conserve / the one the others chastity and honesty. And the law of god
does assygne this cause / saying: Vnheale not the foulenes of such and such
persons / because it is foulenes. But an other end of matrimony not properly
and of it self, but joined unto it / is byndynge and knyttynge to gether of
men, and multiplyenge and increasse of frendshyppe, love, and charity, while a
man is in like manner to his wynes kynsfolke / as he is to his own kynsfolke*
therefore this increase of love and charity should wrongfully take harm / if
any man should mary her / that is knytte unto him all ready by bloudde. For by
this marriage there should be none increasse of any new frendeship love and
charity. And therefore by the laws of man / and also by the estatutes of the
church / there be many degres / in the which folk are forbidden to mary. Ande
saint Thomas says in an other place on this wise. According to diverse times
it is found, that kynrede has let marriage in diverse degres. for in the
beginnynge of mankind father and mother were only forbidden to marye with, by
cause there were few men / and of necessite men were bound to do al their
labor and diligence that they could / for the increase of mankind. and
therefore there were no more persons to be except, but those / which were not
fit to be married withal, and I say fit, as concerning the principal end and
cause of marriage, which is the good or benifit to have issue and children, as I
said before. But afterward / when mankind was increased and multiplied /
there were many mo persons except by Moses law / which began euin at that
time to restrain and refrain man's concupiscence and lust. wherefore (as says
Rabbi Moses) al those persons be except from marriage / which be wont to
dwell to gether in one house. For saying it must needs be, that they / which
come of one pare^tes, or of one father and mother, both men and women
indifferently, company to gether of long time in one house, plainly they should
have great prouocacio^ and stirringe to flesshly lust / if it were not
forbidden, that there should be no such medley between those persons. And now,
when that they think sureli and believe, that there can in no means marriage be
contracte and made between them laufully, straight ways that filthy lust and
pleasure is quenched and ceased / nor does not provoke nor stir their minds
any longer / to desire tho things, that be impossible, and can not be done.
whereby they instruct and taught to tame and refrain their fylthy desire, as
it were by a certain former exercise and practice, and assayenge of them
self: no doubt but by this custom they shall the better absteyne afterward
from other women. for (as saint Augustine says) custom to a thing may do
very much / either to provoke man's appetite / and to make him have a lust or
desire to it, or to turn away his appetite from it, and to make him to abhor
it. And therefore saying that custom does keep in and restrayn our vnmoderate
lust and concupiscence in this matter: men do well to judge / that it is a
shamfull thing to break and corrupt it. For if hit be against right, for
desire of possession, to pass or break the buttels of lands: how much more
unrightful is it, for the lustnes of bodily pleasure, to pass or break the
buttayles of good manners and customs? Furthermore saint Thomas says again /
in an other place. Affinite, that is between persons before marriage, does let
the marriage / that is to be contracted, and does break the marriage / that is
contracted al ready / even like wise as does consanguinitie. And in an other
place. Infidels or vnfaythfuls, that be not baptized / be not bound to the
laws of the church / but yet they be bound to the ordinance of the law of
god. And therefore if any infidels should co^tracte within the degrees forbidden
in the.xviij. chaptre of the Leuiticall / contrary to the law of god, whether
both.ii. or one of them be converted to the feythe / they may not bide still to
gether in such marriage. but if they have contracte with in the degres
prohibit by the ordinance of the church, they may abide still to gether / if
both of them be converted and turned to the faith: or if the one be turned
/ and there is hope, that the other also will be converted.

More over and beside all these things, the same saint Thomas / where as he
goth about to show what is the Popes authority / and what things be in the
Popes power / and what things be not: The Pope, says he, has full power in
the church / that is to be understood, that the Pope may dispense with all
manner of things / that be institute and ordained by the church, or by the
prelates of the church, for these be tho things, which are said to be of
the law of man, or of the law positive, which be no such matters / that they
bind of them self / but only by cause they be commanded. But in such
ordinances, which be of the law of god / or of the law of nature / the Pope
has no power to dispense: because these laws have strength and virtue by the
ordinance of god / and they be upon such matters / that be necessary of
their own selves unto the health of man's soul. And under this manner these
laws must be obseruid and kept in all cases / and every man is bound to
keep them without dispensation. For like wise as in the comune law of man, no
man can dispense / but he / of whom the law has auctorite and strength / and
that is the maker of the law / or else he / to who^ the maker of the law has
given such power: so in the statutes of gods law / which be of god / and
have their auctorite and strength of god, no man has power to dispe^se / but
only god, or he / unto who^ god has specially given such power and auctorite.
For every man, of what so ever auctorite or power he be / is in comparison to
the law of god / even as a private person, having no power nor auctorite / is
in comparison to a comun law of the people. Now the law of god is what so
ever belongs to the new law of the gospel, orels to the old law of Moses,
but this is the difference bitwen the two laws, for the old law did appoint
and set fourth many things / and gave many preceptis, about ceremonies and
outward things, perteyning unto the honor of god, and also diverse precepts
of iugementes, that do serve for to keep justice among men: but the new law
of Christ / and the law of the gospel, the which is the law of liberty and
fredome, has no such determinations, appoyntmentes, or bounds / but is
content with precepts and instructions of good manners of the law of nature /
and with the articles of the faith, and with sacraments of grace. And for
this cause it is called the law of faith / and the law of grace / because it
does determine, which be the articles of the faith, and what is the virtue
of the sacraments. As for all other things, which perteyne to the
determinacion and certain orderinge of suites and judgments between man and
man, orels to the orderinge of the service of god: Christ / the maker of the
new law, did leave them freely to be determined and ordered by the prelates of
the church / and by the princes and kings, that have the rewle of Christ's
people. wherefore all such manner determinations and ordinances do perteyne to
the law of man, wherein the pope has power to dispense: but those things,
that be only of the law of nature, and in the articles of the faith, and in
the sacraments of the new law, he has no power to dispe^se. for that should
not be to have power for to meynteine the truth, but to have power to distroye
the truth. And a littell after he says, that the apostel in his doctrine gave
instructions two manner of ways. for some things he taught, not as his own,
but as publisshing unto them the law of god, as is this: If you be
circumcised, Christ shall help you nothing at all / and many such other
things: and in these the pope has no power to dispense. And certain things
he techeth, as making ordinances by his own auctorite and power. For he
says: wha^ I come, I shall set an order upon the other things. Also he
commanded / that the getheringes of money for pore people should be done on one
of their holy days, or days of rest: the which perteyneth not to the law of
god. And like wise also where he writes, that he, which is bigamus or twice
married, should not be promoted to presthod: that is not of the law of god /
but an ordinance by the auctorite of man / given unto him by god. And hitherto
we have rehersedde the words of Thomas. Now beside him Altissiodorense says
thus. Every person is laufull to contracte marriage with any other person, by
the law of nature, a few except, as the father and the daughter / the mother
and the son: which were except at the beginning. And except those persons
also / which be except by the Leuitical. For those precepts / that be there /
be no judicial precepts / but moral / and perteininge to virtue and good
manners. ye and we call them moral precepts, or rules of virtue, not of man's
teaching, but even of nature. And we say more over / that al precepts of
moralite natural can not be changed, nor dispensed withal, as touching the
substance of virtues. But by the law positive / or the law of man /
matrimony in times passed has been forbidden, unto the.vii. degree of
consanguinitie or kynrede: but now a days only unto the.iiii. degree. Ageyn
Peter of Palude resoninge, whether the pope has auctorite and power, for to
releasse and dispense with these Leuitical prohibicio^s. The pope, says he,
has no power to dispense in the first degree of affinite / no more than he
has in the first degree of consanguinitie: because that it is contrary to the
law of Nature and of god also. For we do reverence unto our fathers wives / as
we do to our own mothers. Marriage also is forbidden by the law of god between
these persons / which be in the first degree of consanguinite or affinite /
not the one straight above the the other / but the one of side half to the
the other, as brother and sister. and therefore in this degree also the pope has
non auctorite to dispe^se / because that this dispensation also is some wise
against nature. And therefore the love and bond, that is between such persons
naturally / does not suffer us to suspect or surmyse / that there should be any
heavy crime committed between such persons. And for this men believe, that even
before the laws of Moses, wha^ that mankind was ones increased / other before
the fludde, or after, they did absteyne from their own systers / and from
their brothers wives, but if it were to stir up sede to the brother / that
was dead, as it is manifest in Thamar, and in Judas children. Nor it is
nothing against this / that we say / that is written of the wives of Abraham
and Isaac / whom their husbondes called systers / by cause doubtless they were
of their bloudde or kinrede / even like wise as Loath was called Abraham's
brother, which was i^ deed Abraham's brother son, and not his brother. No
more the Pope has no power to dispense, that a man should marie the wife of
his brother / although he died with out children. For how be it men were
suffered to do thus in time passed: yet that was not but by dispensation / yea
and that dispensation was by the law of god, and not by no man. For co^munly
by the law of god they did abstain from their brothers wife / as from their
own sister: but it was suffered in that case. wherefore like wise as the Pope
has no power nor auctorite to disspense for a pluralite of wives, al though it
was suffered in time passed / because it was suffered by a certain dispensation
and privilege granted by god, and was forbidden by the co^mun law: no more
auctorite nor power has the pope to dispe^se in the matter / that we speak of
/ that a man may mary the wife of his brother / departed without children / for
to stir up the sede to his brother: because that where that thing was suffered
before times, it was suffered only by dispensation of god / for a certain time,
like as it was to have many wives, and was forbidden generally by the commune
law. Nor ageyn he can not dispense with them that be in the second degree,
the tone above the the other: but on the side half, as to marie with the father
or mothers sister. for this is forbidden by the law of god. And with this
does agree in this matter Antonine, archebisshop of Florence / Ihon^ de Turre
cremata / some time Cardinal of saint Syxt. for John^ partly upon the
auctorite of Pope Innocent, and Peter of Palude / and of Alexander de Hales,
and partly of.iii. other fou^dations / or resons at the last / after that he
had co^fou^ded his adversaries sayenges and opinions, he concluded / that all the degres of consanguinite and affinite, which be forbidden by the law of
god, proceed and come by the showing and instruction of natural reason. and
that therefore these precepts were not taken away in the time of grace, that is
to say, when the law of grace / and of the godspell began, and that the Pope
can not dispense with them. And the self same John^ writes / how that
Eugenius and Pius, being Popes and rulers of the church of Rome, when that
the king some time of France and the Earl of Arminache did instantly desire
the forsayde two Popes, that they would do them so much pleasure, as to
dispense with them / that the Earl might marye his natural sister, and that
the king might mary the sister of his wife, that was departedde: these
forsayde Popes did commit these.ij. matters unto the preside^tes of the
audience of the Rote of the court of Rome, among whom was this forsaide John^
of no small reputation / and to all the other great learned men / which at that
time chanced to be at Rome / that this matter should be examined by their
learning and discrecion / that is to wit, whether it was lefull for the Popes
to dispense in these cases. And after that they had disputed long time upon
this matter, and had taken as much deliberation in it, as the thing required,
all those learned and wise men / with one consent and agreement / came to this
point / gave this sentence, and made answer on this manner / that the Popes
had no power nor auctorite to dispense in these degrees. Their reasone was
this, because that these degres were forbidden by the law of god. The which
verdit and sentence was of so great auctorite and strength, that afterward /
when a certain bishop had forgid a false bull / by the color and pretense of
the which the Earl was married unto his own sister: the bishop was both
deprived from his dignity, and was condemned to perpetual prisone. That if so
be (quod John^) that ever any Pope had dispensed in these degres, because that
either he was ignorant in the scripture of god, or else all to blinded with
covetous of money / which customably be wont to be offered for such
unreasonable and shamfull dispensacions, contrary to all gods law / and
man's: or by cause he would please men rather then god: it follows not for all
that / that he might do it justly and ryghtfully. For the church of god must
be ruled by right and law, not by such deeds or by (...) sone, that is over
us side wise.

And thus also Astexan says / that the Pope can not dispense in the degrees /
that be forbidden by the law of god, in the.xviij. chapter of the Leuiticall:
and yet in degres forbidden by the law of man he may. Again / he says. If
vnfaithfuls have co^tracte in any degree forbidden by the law of nature, or by
the law of god: the marriage between them is no marriage, nor yet never was. For
all be bound to obey the law of god / and the law of Nature, be they
faithful or other. And therefore after that they be converted to the faith /
they must be departed. But if they have contracte in any degree, that is
forbidden only by the church / saying that the laws of the church made for
christian men be not extended unto the vnfaithfuls or hethens, that were never
baptisid / the marriage that was contracte between them was laufull / and
therefore after that they be converted unto the faith, they ought not to be
divorced. And the same man says furthermore, that if mankind should fail and
decay, as hit did in the time of Noe: yet hit should not be lefull for the
brotherne, by their own authority / to mary their sisters, because it is
forbidden by the law of god / but it might be leful for them by the
dispe^satio^ of god. Beside all this John^ Bacon / an englissheman / was in
time passid clapped and whistled out at Rome, because a while he held the
co^trari opinion, that is, that the Pope might dispe^se with degres / forbidden
by the law of god. But at the last he knowleged his error, and said, that the
Pope had no power to dispense in the degrees forbidden by the law of god / in
the.xviij. chaptre of the Leuitical. And afterward, when he had asked this
question / whether we keeping the Leuiticall law of the Iues, be our self
Iues also or no, in so doing / did make answer him self. That the law of the
gospel does admyt the law of nature. But natural reason, does abhor /
that a woman should be subject unto a man / which is her kinsman in the first
degree. Also walden / widforde / and Cotton, very christian and catholic authors
/ reprove diverse other cursed heresies of wyclefe / and that stoutely, and with
great profette of Christ's church: and among al other they do damme also this
heretical and more than phrenetical and mad opinion, where he did hold, as
some would now a days / that these Leuitical prohibitions be only judicial
precepts / and that it is ordined at this time by man / without foundation or
ground / that consanguinite between persons of side half: yea and more over
that affinite in the first degree is an impediment and let of marriage: and they
do clearly and plainly prove / that those Leuitical forboddes, which there do
prohibit to uncover the foulness of our kynne or affinite, that they be not
only no ceremones of the Iues / as wiclefe would / but that eueri one of them
euin at this day, do bind all christian folk by the law of god: and that by all right and reason they ought to be nombred among the moral precepts of
the.x. commandments. For walden says / that the Leuitical laws do bind us
as well as they did the Iues, as concerning the very substance and pithe of
the law, but not as concerning the penalties put unto them. For consideringe
the laws in them self only, they be moral / and of the precepts of the.x.
commandeme^tes / and that euin to so many degrees, as be rekened up there, al
though they be mere and utterly judicial, as concerning the penalty
adjoined. This law from the first beginning of Christ's faith, by all the
fathers, that have been hitherto one after an other / was iuged to bind, by
cause it was the commandment of god. And how it is expired and vanyssed awey
now at wiclefes coming / that it should be no more of the making or
ordinance of god, but the handy work and ordinance of man: this thing let
wiclefe and his scholars try out. Certainly he does offend and break the
honesty and shamefacidnes natural / who so ever discouerethe the priuey
parts of his own flesh and blood / as it were the priueties of a strange
person. And the same opinion of walden Pope Martine the first did approve and
confirm it / and that not without discrecion and sufficient deliberation. For
first of al he took it to the best learned men he could find, that they should
with all diligence they might examine the said opinion. and when it was
examined / allowed, and commended by agreement of all them, to whom the
examination of it was committed: than the Pope, by his auctorite and power did
confirm it.

with these men does agree / among the divines Peter of Tarantase / Dura^de /
Stephan Brulifer, Richard de Media villa, Guy Brianson / Gerson / Paul Rice /
and al most all the schole doctors / which with one assent, do steadfastly
hold / that Infydels or vnfaithfulles / al though they be not under neathe the
laws of the church, yet they be bound to keep the law of nature, and of
god. And therefore such marriages, as they have contract in any degree of
consanguinite / that is forbidden by the law of god / be no marriages: and that
they must needs be dyuorsed. And they think that the contrary custom of
certain barbarous and bestly people do nothing make to the contrary. For /
say they, the heat and feruentnes of carnal lust and concupiscence / has
over cast and blinded in them the precepts and reules of the law of nature.

And among the glosers and doctors of the law canon, John^ Andre, and John^
of Imola do gather and conclude, both by the words of the very text of the
chaptre / Literas, and also by the words of the gloses there / that the degres
written in the Leuitycall / be the same self degres / in the which Pope
Innocent him self does say, that the Pope has no power to dispense. And they
hold utterly / that these words THE POPE CAN NOT, be put there in their own
propre signification / and that this taking and understanding / to say / the
Pope can not / and to understand it / for, he will not / or that it is not
expedient / that this glosinge does distroye the text. And master Abbate
also does hold the same opinion, saying / that the precepts Leuiticall be
moral / and denyenge precepts / which do bind for evermore, that is to say
/ at al times: and that the Pope is never a boue this law of god. Ye more over
that he is bound to defend it / and maintain it with all that ever he can
make and do, and to lease therefore / not only all his goods and lands
temporal, but also his bloudde and his life. And the same Abbate says also in
a another place: I say, says he, that the very words of gods law must be
pondered and wayed: and if this second degree be forbidden by the law of god /
doubtless the church can not dispense therein / and in like manner / seeing that
by the very words of the law of god, wayed and ponderd / the brother is forbid
by the law of god, to take his brothers wife / it folowith / that the church
can not dispense in that case / that a man should mary his brothers wife* The
which thing says he, is worthy to be noted in practisynge of the law / by
cause of these great princes / the which do many times desire dispensations of
the Pope. And likewise / says the gloss in the Chapter, Pitatium, And Mathewe
Nerew of saint Gemin / in his last question / of his tree of consanguinite
and affinite, does also follow the same opinion, as the universal opinion of
all the doctors of Canon. And Vincent, and Innocent, and Ostiense, and Abbate
follow the same opinion. But here had need to be some measure in citynge and
reckoning up of Auctors / for this work should increase and grow to an
infynit thing, if we should reken up here all the names and sayenges of all
doctors, which with hand and foot, do approve and follow this opinion of
ours.

And by the witness and sayenges of those auctors, that we have cited, thou
may well and sufficiently know and perceive, gentle indifferent reder,
first that in those persons / which the law of god does call nyghest of
bloudde / there can be no good and just cause or excuse / for the which it
might be suffered or dispensed with, that one of them should discover the
foulenes of an other / nor there can not be alleged any thing so honest, that
is able to cover the dishonestie of this thing.

Second, that all such foul medles does so defyle and corrupt us, not
only outwardely / but also inwardelye / and in our soul, even after the
truth and teaching of the gospel, that we shall have no rest or quietness
of conscience here / and afterward shall be sure to have everlasting
damnacion / except we forbear such marriages. Thyrdly / that these marriages /
which be made contrary to these Leuiticall prohibitions, be so full of
horrible abomination and foulenes, so openly contrary unto the acts and
deeds of virtue moral, as be reverence and honor to our pare^tes and kynne /
chastity / love / and charity: yea and more over, they be plain against the
ends and causes for the which matrimonye was ordyned / that they be not to be
excused for none ignorance / nor to be suffered, would a man give never so
much / or do never so many good deeds in recompense: nor that they be not to
be let stand for regard of no manner of dispensation, no not though it were to
make peace between great princes / but that they ought and must be punysshed
by the streyte order of justice.

Finally that every one of those prohibitions of marriages, which be commanded
in the Leuitical / be commanded for a plain and a clear reason of justice and
honesty, that is in them / and that is appare^t, and evident at the eye
without any mistical meaning or understanding. Ye and more over that it is
utterly a point of heresye / to say / and hold that they be not but judicial
ordinances of Moses, and that they be at this day abrogate and taken away /
as wyclefe did hold, and that they ought to be observed and kept with all
reverence among all christian people, as moral precepts of natures teaching
/ and that man in no case can dispense with them.

And among al / there is one thing, that I would have the / gentyl indifferent
reder / specially to mark / which diverse of these holy and approved doctors
do hold also / that the brother can not marye a woman / that is but only
handefaste unto his brother / and if he do / the marriage can not stand by
help of any dispensation, and that all such marriages must needs be utterly
broken, lest carnal persons should apply their minds, and be encouraged by
such bestly exemples to do likewise.

And in this opinion both Lire him self is, which says that Adonias, king
David's son / did sin, and did against the health of his own soul, and
contrary to the law of god, written in the Leuiticall, and that therefore he
had well deserved to be slain of Solomon his brother / being king / because
that he desired to have Abisaac, one of the spouses of David his father: and
yet David never touched her, but left her a clean virgin.

Agein that noble divine Hugh of saint Victore is also in the same opinion. For
all though, says he, that the woman, with whom it is known / that the man
had no carnal medlinge / does not perteine to that sacrement or holy mystery,
which Paul calls a great sacrament / that is between Christ and his
church, or company or faithful christian people / yet verily it perteyneth to
an other sacrament or holy mystery / the which is much greatter that is
between god and man's soul. For what? if it be a great mystery / that is in
the flesh / is hit not as great a mysterye / yea and much greatter, that is
in the spirit? for the flesh does nothing help, it is the sprite, that
quickens and gives life. Therefore it is true marriage / and the very
sacrament of marriage, all though there never followed no flesshly a do / ye to
speak better / both the marriage and the sacrament is so much the trewer, and
the holyer, in so much as there is nothing in it / whereof chastity should be
asshamed / but whereof love may rejoice and glory. For if god by scripture be
well called spouse of man's soul / and the soul ageyn the spouse of god,
forsothe there is some thing between the soul and god, where of this thing,
that stondeth in marriage between man and woman, is the sacrament and image /
and likelihode and holy sign or token. And perauenture, for to speak more
plainly in this matter / the very company / which is kept outwardly in
marriage, according to the promys, that each made to other, is the sacrament,
and sign or token. And the thing self of this sacrament, is the love of
minds of one to the other / which is kept between them in this bond of
company, and leage of marriage. And again the same love and favor in their
minds, the tone to the the other, is the sacrament and token of that love and
charity, by the which god joins him self unto man's soul inwardly / by
putting in to the soul, of his grace and by sendinge into the soul part of
his godly spirit, by the which the soul is made one spirit with god.
Therefore the flesshly couplyng, which before the sin of Adam / was in marriage
an office or virtuous deed, and after the sin / it was granted in the same
marriage for a remedy: so both times it is put unto marriage, but so that it is
with marriage / but marriage hangs not of it. For true marriage is before any
flesshely medlynge / and marriage may be holy without any such thing / it
should doubtless not be so fructefull, if such medlinge were not, but marriage
is much cleaner, if no such thing be in it. For that after sin, flesshely
medlynge is suffered in marriage / it is rather of great sufferaunce and
compassion / lest the vice of concupiscence and lustines / which after that
sin was roted in man's flesh / should contrary to all honesty, and without
measure / break forth and flow abroode in every place without any regard, if
there had been no certain place provided by the law, where hit may be
laufullye received. wherefore the very true perfect, and full marriage / is the
same company, conversation, and living to gether / the which is consecrate by
the leage or bond of spousage or promysse, that one does make to the the other,
when both of them by their free and wyllinge promysse / do make them self
detters / the tone to the the other: and do wyllyngly bind them self by
conuenant, that fro hense forth the tone will never depart from the the other to
the company of none other person, while the other is alive / nor that they will
never divorce them self, nor break of from this company / that now is
between them. And if so be it / that unto this conuenant and agreement of
conversation and company to gether, there be put to also in the first metynge a
conuenant and bargayne of carnal medlynge / than the man and the woman be
afterward bound / the tone to the the other / of duty to this flesshely
meddling. And if perauenture at the making of the marriage this carnal couplynge
be remytted on both parties / by the vow and consent or promysse of them
both, afterward they be no more detters the tone to the the other for this
thing. For that thing / which by equale consent and agreement was remytted of
both parties / and confirmed by their vow and promis / it can not be justly
required afterward of other of them, and yet for all that / the sacrament of
marriage stondethe even in this case steadfast and sure / whereof the carnal
couplynge is another cause of the virtue and goodness of it, when it is there /
nor can not take away the virtue and perfectnes of marriage, if it be not there.
And therefore this only consent and agreement of their minds is thought to
uphold and contynewe this vnpartable conversation and living to gether. And
this consent was ordyned for this cause, that this company of the tone with the
the other / the which was begone between them by this consent and agreement,
should not be suffered to be broken at any time, as long as they were both
alive. So that now, reder, as thou have seen by these two auctours, it is
plain and open, that not only the first degree of consanguinitie and
affinite / but also the first degree / wherein marriage is forbidden, for a
Justice grounded only upon acertayne commune honesty and comelynes, is
forbidden by the law of god / in the Leuiticall, and can not be dispensed
withal by men.

And that this thing is very certain and true / thou may take this for a
good proof / that Alexander in time passed / the third Pope of that name,
had leauer to suffer Henry / a citizin of Papi, to be perjured / than that he
would take upon him the authority to dispense with him for his oath / by the
which he had bound him self to marye a maydden to his yongeste son,
which had been made sure before to his eldest son / now being departed.
For he answered the bishop of Papi on this manner: Because, says he, that
it is written in the Leuiticall, that the brother can not have the brothers
spouse, we command the, that thou suffer not this fore said Henry to fulfill
his purpose / and that thou compelle him by the order of the church to do
penance for his vnleafull oath.

wherefore seeing that these things be thought true to so many and so discrete
auctours / that it is not laufull for a man to marye his brothers spouse: how
much more unlawful ought we to think this thing, that a man should marie
his brothers wydowe, with whom his brother had carnally a do, and that he
should uncover the priuities of her / which before is one flesh with his
brother / not only by the bond of marriage self, with the other brother / but
also by reason of carnal commixion and medlynge with the same? And therefore
doubtless every man ought greatly to approve and commend this determination of
these universities / which do hold and conclude / that to marye her, whom the
brother, departed without children, has left, is so forbidden by the law of
god, and also by the law of Nature / that the Pope has none auctorite nor
power to dispense with such marriages, whether they be contracte all redye, or
for to be contracte: except perauenture there be any man, which has a
pleasure to call again into light / old reproved errors and heresies, that
of many years have been condemned.

The fyfte Chaptre.
THus now we have rehearsed and showed before, faithfully and truly / what the
sacre holy auctorite of the old testament and the new / what the use and
custom / consent or agreement of the hole christian church, what the Popes /
what the doctors, interpreters and declarers of holy scripture / finally /
what the assent of wise and well learned men / both in man's law and in goddis
law / do think and judge of these Leuitical prohibitions, and specially that a
man should not mary his brothers wife. And we doubt not / but that these
auctorities and judgments be of such strength / that there is no reasonable
nor indifferent man, but they ought so to satisfy his judgment and conscience,
that he should desire no further proves upon these conclusions of the
universities, and upon this sentence, that they have determined and decreed:
but that these foresaid things be sufficient and able to defend them utterly
from all manner of cauillation. How be it for as much as there be some, that
love well reasons, and there be many, and that strong and invincible reasons,
the which may seem to lyghten and declare this sentence of the universities /
and also greatelye to confirm and prove the same: the next thing that we
must do now / is to use the help of them also in this matter / and to bring
forth and show some of them, as we took upon us and promised before to do.
All the doubt and question of this our matter is dissolved and undone, rather
by definitions and by showing plainly / what every thing is, than by
arguments and reasons. For this question is grown and spronge up, by the
error and false opinion of men / that were ignorant / and did not know the
very true and natural property or propre nature, of the law of god / the
law of nature and of the law moral. And for this cause first of all it
shall be very well done and necessari / to define and to show proprely and
certainly / as a man would say by a certain portrature / what goddis law is /
what the law moral / and the law of Nature is. And to set these
definitions, as ye would say for certain principalles and chief points of our
disputation: of the which we may take all our reasons and proves. And we will
not follow here the scrupulose and curious labor and diligence of some men,
which divide and draw into over many gobettes and peaces / the true
signification / meaning / and nature of these words. Surely we will not meddle
with no such things, which all though they seem at other times / quick or
sharp, and may give and show to thorny, crabbed, and comberous wits
stertyng holes to skape out by / if at any time their armi be brought into a
streyte: yet doutles, as for this matter, they do nothing but make it darker /
and incombre men's judgment. And if this treatise that hereafter follows,
gentyl indifferent reder, shall seem unto the somewhat strange and hard / yet
hardely take the pain to read it / and I doubt not, but thy labor shall not
be so great, but the profet hereof shall be much more / not only for the
understanding of this matter, but of many other / which be very necessary
for christian men to know. Therefore to come to our purpose / the definition of
goddis law is this. The law of god is the word or mind of god, co^ma^ding
things / that be honest, or forbidding things / that be contrary to honesty
/ which law the sacre holy universal church has of long time, by her
auctorite, received and confirmed as other being sowed and planted in the
reasonable creature of god, by the mouth and spirit of almighty god, orels
showed to him by revelation. Here if we chance to mete with a froward and to
curious a reder, we fear, lest that we shall not obtain of him, that he will be
content with this definition. He will streicht condemn it, as falsely forged
and cou^terfet / and shall reason, and say / that it is not made formally,
clarkly, maisterly / nor after schole learning. And again he will find
cauillations / and say, that it is not large and general enough: For that it
does not conteyn the laws other co^sultori or permissiue / that is to say /
laws that give counsel / and laws that do suffer and permit / and this he
will obiecte, because we have defined / that only to be the law of god / which
does bid or forbid. Moreover he shall cry out / and say / that there lacks the
final cause or end, that is / getting of the eternal blis. so that by this
note or mark gods law might be distinct and known a sondre from the
judicial, ceremonial, and man's laws, the which / he will say / be not the
laws of god / by cause that the next and streicht intent of them is not to
order and lead man to that end / which is last of al / and above or beyond
nature / and how that he shall live with god in heaven / but only to an end
natural, how he may live in a common welthe / and in company of men, which is
called a politic or a civil end. Finally he will find cauillations, and
say, that it is a new or a strange definition / and made of our own heed / and
far unlike the definitions, which have been so long used and received in the
scoles. Of the which this is one, that goddis law is a true sign or toke^
notificatiue / which shows to a reasonable creture the richt and true reason
and mind of god / willi^g the same creature to be bo^de to do somewhat or not
to do, and to such like definitio^s as this is. These and such other resons he
will perauenture forge and imagine, who so ever he shall be, that will be curious in
weying and examininge this matter / more than richt and reason requires. But we
do appele from such iugementes to a reasonable indifferent / and a learned reder
/ to whom we doubt not / but that we shall lyghtely persuade and prove / that
it was never our mind to pluck down or break tho things, that have been
received and approved. and that we have expressed and declared, not
indiscreetly and without consideration / but perfectly enough, by this
definition the substance or nature of the law of god. For first saying that
al laws either be the laws of god or man, and the laws of man be all those,
that be ordyned and made, not by the mouth and spirit of god, but immediately
of man / and by the will, tradicion, and auctorite of man / and that command
things, that be honest / or forbid things that be dishonest / for some cause
agreeable to reason: whether this cause be everlasting, or during for a time:
Furthermore saying that all that ever god did speak in approved scriptures,
thou canste not conveniently call them laws or co^mandementes / but them only
/ which do command or forbid any thing, and the which of necessity bind
us / to do as they bid and command us: Finally saying that all men do surely
believe / and so ought to believe, that the universal church alone has that key
of knowledge / and also of power, whereby she may discern and judge, by her
auctorite / the words of god / from the words of men: By these foresaid.iii.
reasons / we know / that a gentle and an equal reder can require nothing
more in this our definition. And we trust / that he will openly grant / that it
is not unlike or disagreynge from those definitions, that be received and
approved, for as much as is perteynynge to this purpose / ye and that it is
also somewhat more fytte, and convenient, tha^ these other be. This chiefly was
our intent and purpose, that we might declare and set forth the law of god
/ after such manner, that it should not alonely be evident and plain, whereby it
differs from man's law: but also that we should ascertayne you, what it is /
as it does comprehend the laws / moral, judicial / and ceremonialles / as
many as be rehearsed in holy scripture to have been ordined and made of god, and
as do bydde or command any thing to be done, or not done: which all alyke
we compte to be the laws of god. For as for the streyt or streytest taking or
definition of the law of god, we did not so much regard it / and of purpose /
and for the nonse, we did leave out the laws consultory and permissiue. For
when the scripture does counsel, or suffer us to do / or not to do any
thing, this is gentylnesse, goodness, and perfectnes of laws, rather tha^ the
laws self, because it is a point of a good and a perfect law / to counsel
and suffer those things / which be another to be bidden nor forbydde^. And yet
if any body will examine and try out this definition of ours / by the rules of
logike, perchance he shall find / that it is absolute and perfet in all
points. But it is no time here to play the logition / and to bring proves
not necessary nor requisite / in a matter plain and evident enough.

For we have declared, as we think, sufficiently enough / what gods law is
/ and also, what laws be worthy to be referred and counted in the order and
noumbre of gods laws / and what laws again ought to be banysshed out
among the sort and route of man's laws. Morouer of goddis laws the divines
make three kinds / that is to sey moralles / which also be called naturals:
and judicials: and ceremonials. The difference of these, the Divines find out
on this manner.

They call morals, which teach and give precepts of the acts, offices or
duties of moral virtue, that is to say / they show how a man shall do
virtuously and after good manners / and what deeds be good and what be not.
Judicials they call those laws / which give precepts of particular acts of
Justice betwixt man and man, and precepts of punishementes and rewards, as
every man deserves.

And ceremonials they call / which command us to do certain outward deeds
to the worshipping of god / from whe^s the name of ceremonies seem to have
spro^ge and come up. we will speak nothing here of ceremonials / which
pertayne nothing to our purpose, by cause that our matter is no cerimonie. As
for the difference or diversity of the moralles and judicials / how they ought
to be taken and understand, we must needs declare more plainly. For herebi we
have seen men / and that well learned, oftentimes blinded and deceived, while
they thought that this word, Justice, which is large and conteyneth many
kinds underneath it / to be single, and conteyne but one kind / nor to be
taken but one weyes only, where as in deed there be diverse kinds of Justice.
One kind of justice is called Legal, universal or general / an other is
called particular.

Legal or general Justice is, which generally conteyneth all virtues
underneath it / and it by it self alone, is all hole virtue / that is: even,
as scripture does call a just man for a good and a virtuous man, and justice
for goodness and virtue / as contrary wise / injustice general is not part or a
kind of vice / but it has in it holly all vice and sin that is.

And now of particular justice there be ij. kinds Distributive / and
Co^mutatiue. Justice particular distributive stands in distribution or
partynge of honor / promotion, or of money / or of other things / which may
be distribute among them / that be fellows of one city or co^munalte. For
these things may be divided among us equally and unequally, and so justly or
iniustly. Particular justice co^mutatiue is ordined to mende and correct such
bargaynes, as we make one with an other. Therefore when there is any doubt or
question of this point of justice / we go to a judge, whose office and deutie
is to make them euin / which be not euin: as when he does condemn a man in a
sum of money, and so takes awey the winning from him / which had more than
right before by deceyte and wrong. Than when the hurt is ones measured and
esteemed / one part is called loss / the other wynnyng: and he is called the
wynner, that puts the other to loss / and he the loser, that has loss.

These things we have spoken for this purpose / that we should understand,
that the Divines, while they say / that the judicial laws do treat upon
particular acts of Justice, between man and manne / they will and mean / that
the Judicials only command and teach / by what means and punisshementes
those thingis may be correct, amended / and brought to a just and an even
point / which belong to particular justice to order / likewise as moral
precepts belong to general justice / to order. And plainly if any man will
search and seche out the exact meaning and definition of the judicial
precepts, specially that be spoken of / in the old testament / he shall
find, that they only be judicial, and so ought to be called, which be
statutes of peynes, or at the leest, those / which god in time passed did
answer unto Moses, when that he asked him counsel of the suits and
controversies of the Iues. For seeing the beginning of wisdom is the fear
of our lord, that same people so stubbourne and intractable, ought for fear
of punysshement to have been moved and prouokedde to virtue / and to be drawn
back from their wont and accustomed sin, lest that they, as men vnreuly
and intractable, should by their sin so greatly have moved and provoked god,
that they should rightfully, and of their deserving, have gone down quick to
hell. Therefore afterward that the moral precepts were given / in the mount
called Syna / with incredible fear and horror or quakynge of the herers: anon
after were given them also the judicial precepts, in the which god did
nothing else, but teach and show what vengeance ought to be taken upon them
/ that do trespass / and tra^sgresse those foresaid moral precepts. For the
judicials, as Thomas says, have their name of this word judgment. And as
for this word, judgment, betokens exercysynge of justice / which is done
by reason, applienge the laws or rules of justice certainly to such special
cases, as belong only to the ordryng of some certain people among them
selfs, and that considering the state of that people only. for, says he,
seeing the moral precepts be common to al people, and that many of them,
specially of the affirmatiues / do apoint neither time / place, nor manner, how
to keep them: it is necessary / that these circumstances be specified and
determined by some law, either of god, or man. And therefore as that general
commandment / that god must be honored and worshypped, is specified and
declared outwardely by ceremonial precepts: so like wise that same
co^mandme^t of keeping justice among men / called the lauful or general
justice / is determined by the judicial precepts / that is done by a judge,
applyenge the universal and first rule of general justice, to some
particular matter / and to the private state of some one co^mun wealth / and to
the profet and benifyt of the same only. By these foresaid things we think,
that it is evident and plain, what laws ought of rycht to be called judicial
laws of god. Truly those which have be^ made and ordined of god him self i^
holy scripture, to the gouernynge, not of all people / but of the Iues to
gether among them self, and that in such things as perteyne to particular
justice / and have no moral reason in them selfs, nor should be of no
strength nor authority, if there were nothing but reasone to move thereto:
but the cause of their making was the state of that people, and other
authority and strength have they none / but only by cause they were made. for
their auctorite stands rather in that they be decreed and commanded, tha^ in
any reason of general justice of god / as which stand more in decrees and
penalties / then by reule or by reason of commune justice. For there is no
commune nor general justice in them, but they be only just for them that
they were made for. And thus we have showed the, what is the judicial law of
god. Now i^ the definition or certeintie of the moral and natural law, is
great derkenes and doubtfulnes / because it is co^munly unknown, nor has not
ben written nor declared clearly and diligently of any divine (as far as we
have read) by what short and substanciall way / we might find out by a sure
facion of reasonynge, what is the law of nature, how many kinds there be of
it, and also which be the things, that natural reasone should show and
teach us. These things doutles be very dark and over rolled and wrapped in
most deep and thick derkenes, by cause that all people on al sides / in manner
by a commune consent and agreement, follow vice and sin / and of so long time
has fallen away and clean forsake their very propre nature, so that partly by
cause there be so many vicious customs, partly by cause there be so many vain
opinions, and misordered iugementes, so many crooked errors / and ignorance /
so many froward manners / finally because there is so great diversity, both
of men's wits / and of men's appetites and disposytions / the holy light of
nature is in manner utterly extincte and put out, and skante appears or shows
it self at all any where, and the sharp or quick sight and true judgment of
man's reason, by the which he should know / what is good / what is ill / what
is true, and what is false, destitute of his light and rightnesse / and
lacking the holy ghost or spyrite of god / which is the ruler and governor
of reasone / is utterly become obscure and dark. Therefore here we must rest
and tarry a little while / that as far as our wit and capacite will serve us
/ and this our matter will suffer / we may give light to these dark things /
and undo the knottes of the doubts so as it may be. There is in man / all
though it be meruailously blinded and darkenedd, a certain prudence, or
commune wit engendered in him, graven in him by god his maker at his first
creation / and this wit or reason they call natural light / and light of
understanding / and the light of the visage of god, the image of god / the eye
of the reasonable mind, a parceiuinge of good and evil, right and wrong,
finally they call it natural reason. Beside this there be written in the heart of
man with the finger of god certain rulis or lawis of general justice virtue and
honesty, which they call the first principils to live by, according to virtue
/ the first rules to do justly, which were to man as exe^plars or patrons for
to follow / and to show him how he should do justly / the first truths / seeds
of vtues / sparcles of nature, imperfecte vnderstondinges / general knowleges,
co^mun sense or perceuera^ce, co^mun wisdom / finalli beginninges to al moral
justice and virtue. Now the office of the forsaid natural reason and prudence
is to show, that we ought to do / or leave those things, what so ever these
rules of common justice or virtue does show us. And because that the same
rules of general justice co^teine the perfect and true nature of vtue / they
teach / that those thingis only, which in the manners of al men universally,
be good or evil, right or wrong, ought to be followed, or avoided / euin for
the things them self / and for obteining of everlasting blis. For this rule
is no other thing in deed, then a certain line leading us to honesty and
virtue, and from disonestie and vice. So that what so ever is done, according
to this reule / it must needs have the name of virtue, by the which virtue
man is called good / what so ever is done contrary to this rule, it must have
the name of vice. This reule therefore joined with that commune prudence or
wisdom, we call the law of nature. If thou will defyne it: it is a general
knowledge and judgment, which god did grave in the mind of every man, to
help him / for to form and facion his manners and living. And it needs not
us to go far to seche the proof of these things / that we have spoken /
seeing that there is no man, but that he has in him sometime an examynation and
remembrance of him self, and remorse or conscience / that does judge and
co^de^ne him. and where so ever these be / there must needs also be some law /
from whose techynge the misdoer may perceive, that he has swarued, and that
he has not performed tho things / which the law commanded him. And as for
this law both Paul him self / and almost all the divines and the
philosophers / call the law of nature, and sey, that it is a certain commune
sentence or judgment / condemnynge or allowinge the deeds of men, the which
god did grave in the heart of man with his finger. In so much that unto us
truly the law of nature / to speak of it generally, seems to be no other
thing / but these first reules, and first judgments, that man had /
which were made with man / or rather borne with him / and graven in him of
god. But to speak of it specially and properly / and to show how it
differethe from all other things / these two things following, seem to us to
have been added to the definition very conveniently and to the purpose, that is
to say / which god did grave in every man's mind / and again which is fytte
and convenient to form and facion the manners and living of men. The first is
added because we should understand, that they only be natural laws, which
have been written with the finger of god / or rather borne in the heart of man /
stablysshed and confyrmed by agreement of all nations / and not made by the
ordinance of men / or by their lawis / their counnynge / opinion, or reasonynge
/ nor finally by no usage or custom of men. The second is added because, that
where there be many knowleges and iugementes in us, all alyke can not be called
laws of nature. But to open this thing some what plainly / you shall consider,
that in ma^s reason there be.ij. parts, the one is occupied about study of
sciencis / that is called Speculatiue, the other about the ordring of his life
/ which is called Active. And as this part, that longs to study / has his
natural principils / and them most true / and so plain of them selves / that
they need nor can not be proved by none other means but only by them self,
of whose trewthe and knowelege hangs the truth and knowledge of all other
things, that be treated in any of the speculatiue sciences: So truly god, that
is most good, most wisest, and most of power / after that he had made man
unto his own image and lykenes, richt and without any crokednes / without any
vice / streicht ways he put in him his spirit and holy ghost, which should
inflame and kyndle him to goodness and virtue: and did by and by grave in his
mind / in the other part of his reasone / that served to the ordering of his
life / certain general knoweleges / and general reules / upon virtue, and
upon all things / that he should do, which should be as you would say /
certain principilles, grounds / and chief conclusions / and that as it were
certain, most sure, and most true reules to judge by, with richt, and
according to reason upon all the manners and deeds / that belong to man. And
truly these general rules of common justice or virtue, we call laws of
nature.

Now to show you, what is the moralle law of god: what so ever is commanded
of god in holy scripture, and is showed unto us inwardly in our hearts by these
fore said general rules / or that in a good and formal reason folowith of
them / or else that agrees with them / though it does not follow of them:
all these the Divines call the laws moral / which law they defyne and
determyne on this manner.

The moral law of god / is the word or mind of god / co^maundynge those
honest things / and forbyddynge those unhonest things, which the natural
reasone of man lychtened with the lychte of the word of god, does, according
to the rules and teaching of commune justice or virtue, teach us to do / or
to leave: and which the same naturalle reasone self so lightened, does show
us / that we be bound to keep them / al though they were never commanded by
none other law. These things well known and understand, it shall be easy and
plain to know the difference between the laws moralles and judicials. For
the laws morals were graffed and planted in man by nature / or at the least
came of natural reason / and this natural reason ever and at all times before
any law was written / or any city made, god him self did plant in man: but
the Judicial laws were showed to man afterward / nor stand not by nature,
but by ordinance, and making. Again, moral laws serve to order, according
to the rule or prescript of general justice, all virtuous deeds / by the which
a man is made good. And as for those judicial laws / served not but only to
the ordering of the Iues among them self, and in those things only that
belonged to particular Justice. The laws moral have of them self a natural
and moral cause generally to all nations why they were made: but there was no
cause, why the judicial laws of god were made / but only the state or
condition of the Iues. The laws moral be perpetual and unchangeable, by the
consent of al nations / and so remain and endure, by cause they have their
strength and power by the teaching of natural reason, so illightened,
although they were never commanded by none other law. These judicial laws be
used and accustomed only by ordinance.

The syxte Chaptre.
But of the licht and troth of our two worthy grounds and principilles /
that is / the definicion of the law moral, and the law judicial, of the
which two we will make a sylogisme or perfect reason, we have spoken
sufficientely. Therefore now we will go forth with other things, that pertein
to our purpose, and shall endeavor our self, to show and declare / that tho
Leuiticall prohibitions / whereby we are forbidden to marye our brothers wife,
and to show his filthiness, is a law moral, coming of nature. And this
thing we shall bring to pass / perauenture / if we make you a reason out of
the definitions after this manner.

Every saying of god / that commaundethe honest things / and forbyddethe
unhonest things, which the natural reason of man / clered by the lychte of
the word of god / commands to be done, or to be eschewed / according to
the rule and teaching of general Justice or virtue, and that has authority
and strength even by natural reason only, all though it had never ben
ordyned by none other law: is a law divine, moral / and natural. But these
Leuitical prohibitions, be sayenges of god / that do forbydde dishonest things,
which the natural reason of man, lychtened by the word of god, commands to
be eschewed, after the rule of general justice and virtue / and have their
authority and strength, even by natural reason only, all though they had
never ben forbidden by none other law. Therefore they be godly, moral, and
naturalle laws.

But if that any man here by chance will / by his crafty wit, reason, and
bold stubbournely, that some of those things / which we have taken to prove
our co^clusyon with all, be not true: the text and the order of the history
/ and of the place, that we have before rehearsed, out of the Leuiticall / shall
sone overcome him. For truly first of all, that those laws be sayenges,
commanded to the reasonable creature, not by the will of man / but by the
authority or teaching of god him self: the manner / the time, and causes of
their institution, or first ordinance do plainly declare. yea and this thing
also, that is so often rehearsed there / declares and shows the same / that
is, I your lord god. So that we need no more to doubt of the auctor or maker
of these laws.

Second the universal catholyke and apostolyke church has showed / that
those laws were taught us by the spirit of god, and by god / by cause that
the church has put the.v. books of Moses / and among them the holle book
Leuiticall in the noumbre of these works / which by undoubted vsaunce and
consent of long time / the church has approuedde and confyrmedde / to have been written by the spirit of god. This same thing truly the sacre holy
cou^sayles, the honorable Seanis have decreed / the holy fathers privately every
man in his works has judged / the same thing till this day has been believed
and received of all christian men. And forsothe / seeing that the catholic
church has approuid this thing as strongly as can be / and has publisshed and
wytnessed the same openly to all the world, that those prohibitio^s / the
which we now speak of, be expressly and plainly written in the book Leuitical
/ and that the book Leuiticall / which can not err nor lie / does plainly
show and declare / that these laws were showed and spoken by the spirit of
god, through the mouth of Moses to the people of the Iues: truly no man can
say nay, but that these Leuiticall laws be oracles or sayenges / that came
out of the mind of god / nor were not made by the ordinance of any man.
Third, and that these Leuitical prohibitions be sayings / which do forbydde
such thing / that of it self is naught and again honesty / and such a
thing truly as the natural reasone of man / lychtened with the licht of the
word of god, does show / should be avoided / that is to say / the fylthy,
foul / and shameful couplynge with our brothers wife, the pith and strength of
this word MAN shows and declares: by the which word it is signified, that
they, which so come to their broders wife / be no longer men, but brute bestes
/ in so much that god calls it fylthines / a mischeuous and acursed deed /
abomination and infamy / and a thing unlawful / that any man should mary his
brothers wife. And this thing is plain / also by cause that god does threten
to punysshe grievously and sharply the breakers of these laws / that is to
say / that they shall be blotted and clean wyped out of the mids of his
people / and that they should be spued out of their land / and they shall dye
without chylderne / and yet we will not speak one whit of the more greuouse
and sorer punisshementes. For mark well / god threteneth.iij. manner
punysshementes to the breakers of these laws: first temporal punisshmente,
that they shall be cast and banysshed out of their country. Second, that
they shall be without children / which punisshment comes only of god. And
thyrdly everlasting punysshement, that is the banisshment of the soul out of
the company of god for evermore. For as this seyinge / to be put out of the
mids of his people / means not that we should be punysshed by any bodily
death, but that we shall not be reckened nor compted in the nombre of saints
or of chosen people. And not only they were thus punysshed / but also their
bastardes / that came of such forbidden marriages, which in Hebrewe be called
Manzer, were forbidden the temple. for the Iues call him Manzer, which is
begotten by any of these forsaid fylthy couplinges / and reken him as a
bastard / and borne of an harlot. All these trewely were thought unworthy
and unmeet to come in company of the people / which was gathered to keep and
celebrate the feasts and holy days / or unworthy to have any thing a do /
or any office in the church of our lord / whereof this thing seems to have
come up, that now under the gospel, bastardes can not be promoted to holy
orders. Therefore seeing that god him self here does plainly pronounce and give
sentence, that the Chananes and the Egyptions did defile their land, and
spotted it with filthiness / while that they did contracte marriage with their
brothers wives, and that he for that cause did greatly abhor them, and did
most richtefully take vengeance upon them / and punysshed them most sharply
/ it can be none other wise, but it must needs follow / that god has judged
this thing to be shamfully unhonest and of them self / as they sey / morally
evil and naught / and also against the richtnes of natural law and reasone,
yea to be abominable and abhorred. For wherefore else would god have punysshed
so greatly and so grievously the Chananeis and the Egyptions for these sins
and mischeuous deeds? For truly it was never hard, that the transgression of
the iuditiall or ceremonialle precepts, which only were given to the
children of Israel / did at any time so greatly displease god, that he would
vtterli distroy them therefore. For seeing the judicial and ceremonial laws,
have no power nor strength to bind us but only after they were made, truly
the same prohibition / breakinge of the which god even among the heathens,
yea and that before the law was made / did so greatly abhor and turn his
face from it / can not be judicial, but plainly moral, as that is agreinge
with the very teaching of nature / and that should be written in every man's
heart / al though in some men it be blotted out with wickedde and noughty
manners, and ungracious custom. For else what reason should that be / and what
richt or conscience / to punisshe for doing that thing / that is not
forbidden by any law? For as god is not wont to punisshe iniustly, and
against right, so he is not wont to punisshe but for transgression of some
law. And as for the Egyptions and the Chananeis / at that time had no law of
god written / but the law of nature, which ought to have been written in their
hertes.

But if any body will say here / that these words, where he calls them
mischeuous and abominations, and also these punisshementes and thretes /
which he puttethe there / belong not to the first prohibitio^s / whereby we
are commanded to avoid marriage with them / that be of our blood / but that
they ought to be referred to the latter prohibitions: here let him diligently
mark and consider the order and process of the xviii. Chapter of the
Leuiticall / and what the law maker intended to do in it, and after what manner
he has divided and parted the order of his holle matter / and at the last let
him compare and set to gether the forsaide.xviii. Chapter, with the.xx. of the
same book / and there truly he shall perceive / that the said.xviii. Chapter
of the Leuitical / even throw out / partly does move us, partly does teach
us. He moves his people of the Jews to absteyne from the most cursed and
ungracious manners and customs / and from such things / as among them were
taken for laufull, and this his intent / he sets forth in the beginnynge of
the chaptre. And afterward, lest the people / as yet rude and unlearned / by
cause they knew not the law, should have been ignorant, and not have known /
from what manners and laws they should refrain them self, he took upon him
the office of a master: and when he had reckened up their most ungracious
facions of manners, he teaches them, from which manners they should abstain /
and streycht after, when he had made an end and performed the office of a
teacher, he tourneth him back again to the craft and policy of dissuading,
and moves them to abstein from the forsaide crimes / partly for fear of
punisshemente, partly by the examples of the Chananees and the Egiptiens / of
whom he shows / that he took great vengeance and punisshementes, by cause
they had spotted and defiled them self / their land and country, with these
ungracious vices. Now if the lawmaker had understand this last end of the
chapter, on the latter prohibitions only / by and by he should have fallen
out of his purpose, as though he had forgotten in the last end of the
Chapter, what he intended in the beginning. And trewely thus he should have
done in a manner as uncomely, as if any sorry orator or preacher in the beginning
of his oration or sermon would promysse / that he would dissuade men to absteyn
from all vices, and afterward when he had dehorted and moved the people from
one or two vices / would go his ways leaving the rest / and so mock and
deceive the expectation of the herers.

And also he shall perceive this / that here, where as the lawemaker gothe
about to dehorte the people of the Jews to absteyne from tho things, that
were laufull among the hethens, he does call them cursed abominations / and
so augmenteth and increasseth the greuousnes and greatness of them, so that he
judges every one of the crimes to be sufficient / to thruste out the Chananeis
from their seats and natural country. For as for adultery, or the sin
against nature, was never laufull among them, but these inceste and beastely
marriages. why than should we not think, that the lawemaker did mean on the
first prohybitions? and why should not the words of abhominacion and
execration, and likewise the peynes and punyssheme^tes there put, belong as
well to them / as to the latter prohibicions? Certaynely in the.xx. Chapter /
this is the last prohibition of all / that we shall not marye our brothers
wife. And streyghte after that follows: all these things the gentyls and
hethe^s have done / and therefore I did abhor them, so that it is reasonable
and fyt for us to believe / that the lawemaker did myngle and confou^de to
gether these things a purpose and for the nonste / doubtless to thentent that
we should perceive and understand / that they were al to gether acursed and
all worthy of punisshement* Furthermore it seemed to the holy fathers, which
were chief heedes in the counsel Tolletan, and Agathense / that these peynes
and punissheme^tes should be referred to these, inceste, beastely, and unkind
marriages.

Finally Isichius / Rabanus, Rupert / and william of Parris, following the said
Isichius, plainly does refer and apply those words / and those penalties
to the breaking of this commandment, that a man should not mary his brothers
wife. And truly we have brought forth hereto fore / for witness and
confyrmation of this sentence, many other proves / both of holy counsayles /
and also of learned men of great auctorite and crede^ce / so that it shall be
void and superfluous to tarry in this. Moreover that natural reason does show
and prove, that it is sin and unhonest, to couple our self to our brothers
wife / even this thing does easily confirm and prove / by cause that there was
never nation so beastly / none so without all humanite / but that they
perceived and knew / that they ought this honor / duty / and reverence to
their brethren and brothers wives, that they should refrain from their
marriages. Many did violate and break this law. For this thing truly is
wont to be done, by the fauty and vicious custom of men / that folk do
sacrifice every where to idolles / and slay, and steal / and commytte adultry,
and finally wicked sinners tread under their feate all gods laws, and
man's, yet for all that / all these do think surely / that these things
ought not to be done, and thus they think, not taught by man's laws, but by a
certain virtue and licht of natural reason, planted and grounded in them. For
else how should this be / that these hethen Poetis, hethen hystory writers /
and heathen lawemakers, should almost in all their works speak so much of
this kind of Incest, and of the peynes and punisshementes / with the which
all nations were wont to revenge this not to be spoken vice? And who is he /
which has seen any thing in the writing of the old histories and laws /
but he knows, that this manner of inceste has been had in great infamy,
reprofe, and sclander / and that not in one city or country / but almost in
every place, and among all men, has been condemped as a certain wickedness
against nature.

Abimelech, a good and a just man, after the manner of the law of Nature / and
also greatly lauded and commended of god, did he not think and judge / that it
could not be possible / that Sara might be both sister and also wife to
Abraham? the which Abraham / when he went about by all means / that he could,
to keep it close / that Sara was his wife / he had no stronger reason for him /
than for to say / that she was his sister. The which answer of Abraham,
should in no wise have pleased and contented the Egiptions and Gerarites, if
those nations had thought, that the said Sara could have been both his sister
and his wife. As if a greek would ask me / whether I were a married man / and I
should folysshely answer him again, and say, that I am a priest / where the
greek knows well enough / that one and the same self man may be both a
priest and a married man, and all at ones. So Aristotell a great philosopher, it
is an unreasonable thing, says he, that Socrates did forbid the marriage of
them that be of one blood / for none other cause, but that there should have
come to much pleasure of it / and that it makes no matter, whether he marye
his mother, his daughter / or his sister.

And a man may here of the hystoryes and the Poets, what infamye and shame is
spoken of Macareus, Caunus, Cydon, Pub. Clodius, whom Cicero accused of incest
/ Marcus Antonius the emperor, Ptolomeus Euergetes, Caesar Caligula, Co^modus the
emperor, Ptolomeus Philadelphus / brother to Hypermestra, Cambises king of
Perse, and all because they defiled their sisters, by the not to be spoken
pleasure and lust of the flesh. Nor truly it is no small infami / nor can not
be lichtly washed out / wherewith these persons, here following, be noted in
the histories. Thereus king of the Thraciens / because he had to do with his
wives sister. Thiestes by cause he had to do with Europa his brothers wife, and
also with his daughter Pelopeia / and Aufilena / by cause she had a do with her
fathers brother, Hypermestra / because she did by deceyte obtain her pleasure
of her husbands brother / and also Flauius Domitian / Theodorycke the French
king. Leucon, and Philippe, brother to Alpho^s the king of Hyspayne / those
truly because they did corrupt their brothers daughters, and these because
they coupled them self with their brothers wives.

And more over the prudence and wisdom of the Emperors has thought, that
the natural bond or leage will not suffer, that we should suspecte or presume
any such heavy crime between these persons / yea and it is provided for also
by the sacre laws of the same emperors / and openly commanded, that no man
should marie his brothers wife, or.ij. systers / no not al though the marriage
be by any means broken and undone / but that they should al absteyne from
incest marriages. And lest this ungracious license and leude liberty / should
be strengthed by any damnable color or cloak, it pleased themperours also that
al such rescriptes and writtes and licenses granted by the emperor and that
with the advice of his counsel / and also all manner of other laws and
co^stitutio^s, should utterly be anulled and taken a way, which has given
license to certain persons in the time / when tyranny reigned, that such
ungracious mynglinge should have the name of matrimoni / and that it should be
lefull to couple our self by most foulest medlynge or couplynge that can be,
to our broders daughter, or our sisters daughter / or her / which had dwelled
with our brother in time passed under the rycht and title of marriage. And that
the lawemakers have evermore taught and judged to be most shameful and
abominable, that any man should marie him self to his brothers wife / it is
evident and plain by this reason, because all heathens / every one after the
custom and manner / did with diverse and sore punisshementes execute the law
of these incest and filthi marriages / sometime buryenge such unchaste women
quick, sometime gyuynge them liberty to chose their death / and as for the
corrupters of them, some al their goods were confyscate and escheted / and
they banysshed / nor could not be suffered to make any testament / nor to have
their children / their heirs / and some commanded to be beaten to death with
rods in the comen place, and in the sight of all the people / And some that
their sheldes and arms should be plucked down, and their titylles, and feats
to be scraped out / And did also decree / that all mention, remembrance / and
memorial of them / should be fordone. But truly it should be infinite and an
endless labor, to reken up all the incest persons / or the peynes given them
by the law, the infamy, commune hatrede, and sclaunder, which they were in /
not in one or two cities or nations, but every where, as far as the world is
wide / which did not refrain them self from this kind of incest.

Furthermore that to marie our systerne / is forbidden by the law of nature,
appears plainly by this, that all the most approved doctors of the Church do
excuse such marriages by necessite. and what should it have been need to excuse
them / under color and prete^se of necessite / if it had not ben of it self*
unlawful and evil.

But let us harken, what Chrysostomus sath, vvilt thou know, says he, by what
means it was lefull sometime / to have our sisters to our wives? How had
Cain and Abel, Rasan and Edodam their sisters / and did not sin? because the
scarsenes of men and women / and the necessity / excused that sin.
Afterward when the nombre of men and women was increased, the said evil came
into his own nature / and began to be sin. And at that time it was in use
and custom / that one man mycht laufully have many wives, but afterward the
world ones increased and multiplied / than this iuell also came to his own
nature, and began to be sin.

Also saint Hierome does plainly mean by those words, that were rehearsed
before out of him / that nature does so greatly abhor such marriage, that it
ought not to be named or spoken / lest that the devout earys be sore offended
with so abominable a word.

Also saint Augustyne agrees to the same. For he says, when mankind after
the first marriage of Adam, which was made of duste / and Eve his wife, made
out his side, could not be increassed without coming to gether of man and
woman / and there was tha^ another man nor woman / but that came of them two:
the brethren took their systers to wife. The which thing the more older that
it is / in so much that it was done at that time only, when necessity drove
them to it / so much the more it was afterward damnable / when that shame
drew them from it. For they had consideration / as it was most richt and
convenient, of love and charity, that men / to whom it was profitable and
honest to be in unite and concord: should be knit and joined to gether by
sundry degrees of kynred, and that one man or woman to an other should not have
many degrees, but with sundry and diverse degrees should be departed among
sundry and diverse persons: and every person to have but one degree to an
other person: but at that time there was not wherewith these things micht be
brought to pass, seeing that of these twain, Adam and Eve / there were no men
nor women, but all brethren and systerne. Therefore at that time, that thing
ought to be done, when it was possible to be done: that when there was plentye
of women / men should take such wives, as were not their systers. At which
time there was not only no necessity to do it / but also if it were done / it
should be a sin not to be spoken. The which thing we se was so well
observed, even among hethens and idolaters and wicked worshippers of many and
false gods / after that mankind was ones increased and multiplied / that al
though it was suffered by noughty and corrupt laws / to marye with our brothers
wives, yet for all that, the custom among them was much better / whereby they
were brought to this, that they would in no wise use this license, but utterly
did abhor the dispensacion of the law, and so held against it, as though
it could never have been laufull.

Therefore seeing that these so holy and devout men do call those laws
corrupt and noughty, which suffer, that brethren and systerne should marie to
gether, and syenge they affirm, that these / which worship false gods /
did never use such marriages, bud did abhor the same license and dispensation
of the law, finally / seeing that they sey / that it was not leful for the
first men and women / but only because of necessity / truly it is plain,
that such manner of marriages were not of their own nature laufulle / even at
that time / when they were not yet forbidden by Moses law.

The which thing also in an other place saint Augustine does witness: For,
says he, Abraham did live in the world at that time / in the which self
same time it was not laufull for brethren and systerne to mari to gether,
whether they had both one father and mother or diverse.

Also Isichius upon the Leuitical says, It was thought tolerable of many,
that brothers and systers mycht marye to gether / by cause Abraham said of
Sara / she is my sister by my fathers side / and not of my mothers side. The
which utterly is not, as men think the history is. For Moses rekennynge up
all those / that were begotte of Their, Abraham's father, makes no mention at
all of Sara. And it so were / that Abraham did marye his own sister: yet it
was before he knew god. Therefore it is sin to couple our self to our sister
by bond of marriage. wherefore it is clear by this auctour Isichius, that
maryages between brethren and sisterne were not leful before the law, that is
to say, in Abraham's time / which was before the law of Moses more than.
CCCC.xxx. year.

So Methodius and Berosus, which reckoning up the causes of Noes floudde,
tell both one cause. The one of them says, it was by cause brotherne
shamefully had a do with their systers. The the other, because Cains chylderne
began to abuse their brothers wives by abominable fornicacion.

But we need not to tarry in rehersynge up the auctours, which make to our
purpose in this behalf. Truly if they, which were wrapped in so greatte
darkness / that they did not perceive / that they should worship one god,
did yet perceive / that they should not marie their systers / but did
naturally abhor such marriage / ever more hated and condemned them / as
cursed, and inceste, and not only they / but also the most holy and most true
interpreters of the holy scripture do witness the self same thing to us in
their wrytinges, it is as clear as can be / that these prohibitions were
brought in by the law of nature, and that the law of nature and reasone, moved
by the law and the word of god, does command and teach us, that such
conjunction must be utterly abhorred / as a wicked sin against nature.

If any man here will say, be it, that we grant, that these things be true
/ as touching the marriages of brethren and systerne, yet it is far a another
manner of reckoning / as touching our brothers wives. Let him understand /
that he is greatly blinded and deceived. For if it be against the law of
nature, that any man should mary his own natural sister, because it is not
lefull by the law of nature to discover her foulenes, and he, which marieth
his brothers wife / discovers the foulenes of his brother / he also shall
break the law of nature / which coupleth unto him by marriage his brothers
wife. Although we have made it plain and evident enough before, yet we shall
put to these.ij. reasones, that follow, which shall prove the same as openly
as can be, that a man can not mary his brothers wife. First / because
affinity does as well let marriage / as does consanguinite. Second, by cause
he that so marieth, does shame and dishonestie to his father by the means. Of
the first if any man do doubt / he may well understand / that this thing is
very true, and it were but by this reason only, that not all only by the law
of god, so many persons be excluded from marriage in the line of affinity /
as be excluded and forbid in the line of consanguinitie: but that also the law
of the church is compelled to set the bonds of marriage in the lines both
of affinity and consanguinitie / in a like distaunce or degree. And this thing
is plain by the authority not only of July and Gregory Popes / and also of
saint Augustyne, and Isodore, whose sayenges be received and approved in the
law of the church, but also of Abbate / and of all those that write upon the
chapter PITATIVM, And the chapter CVM AD MONASTERIVM DE STA. MONA. And the
Chapter NON DEBET. DE CONSANG. ET AFFIN. That if there had not ben as great
cause, why they / that be of affinite should have been as well forbidden to mary,
as they that be of consanguinite, but there had been a greatter cause, why
they that be of consanguinite should be forbidden / then they that be of
affinite / truly so wise law makers would have bound these persons of
consanguinite, unto a streiter bond of marriage, then persons that be only of
affinite / and not both utterly of like and in one degree. But now / seeing
one self same prohibicion of the law of god does conteyne all persons /
as well of consanguinite, as of affinite in the first degree, and of the first
kind / and that both by the law of god / and the law Canon / we ought to
absteyne as well from these persons / that be of our wives bloudde, as from them
that be of our own bloudde / by cause that man and wife be both one flesh
and blood / as witnesses this saying of god: They shall be.ij. in one flesh:
And because that the kynred of both sides / that is to say, of the man's side /
and the woman's side / ought to be compted common to them both, truly we
should take our brothers wife even as our own natural sister, as touching the
prohibition of marriage / like as our daughter in law ought to be taken of us,
even as our own daughter, as saint Augustine says. And that the second also
is very true / it is very evident and plain. For he that marieth his broders
wife / takes his fathers flesh and bloudde to marriage. The which thing
plainly is against the law of nature. For saying the husband and the wife be
one flesh and blood: truly he / that takes his brothers wife, takethe also
the flesh and blood of his brother / and as for our brother is the flessh and
blood of our fader and mother, and that more nerer unto them, than any of both
their sisters / because he is their own son. Therefore if it be forbidden by
the law of god / and also by the law of nature to marie our fathers sister,
or our mothers sister / or else the wife of our fathers brother / or mothers
brother / whose wives be but of affinite to us, and that only in the second
degree: truly much more it should be against nature, to mary our brothers widow.
For the nerer that they come to the stock, and to be one flesh and blood,
the more they ought to be forbid. But our brother is more nerer unto our fader,
as it is above said, then is either of our uncles or auntes.

And here be proves enough / by the which we have showed, as it becommed us,
that these Leuiticall prohibitions / that we should not marye our brothers
wife. etc. come of natural reason.

Now there remains, to show / how the same be touched us by the said
natural reasone / according to the reules and teaching of general justice
or virtue, for to form and order the manners of men. And this we did prove
partly before / and now we shall speak of this same matter more largely. For
the reule of commune Justice or virtue does teache us tho things only, which
in the manners of all men universally be good / evil, rychte, crooked, just,
unjust / and such as ought to be followed or avoided / even of them self and
for the obteynynge of everlasting bliss. And truly there is no man, but
says, that tho things / which be forbid in the Leuitical laws / be such
things. For first they perteine and serve to facion and order men's manners.
For here truly we call the MANNERS of men, the outward deeds of men, and also
the inward affections and disposytions of the mind / what so ever they be,
that come of moral virtue / the which who so ever does keep and perform /
it shall be said / that he lives well / and does well / and he shall be called
verily and truly a good man. Now as for these Leuyticall laws / do not only
belong to chastity / but also to PIETY, by the which, as Cicero defines /
we be taught to do our duty and dyligente honor and service to our
country, to our parents / and to them of our bloudde / and utterly to all
men, all that right and reasone will we shall do. This thing the first law
of marriage declarethe plainly inoughe, which is this, THIS BONE now is of my
bones / and this flesh and bloudde of my flesh and bloudde: For the which
thing a man shall leave his father and his mother / and shall stycke to his
wife. The which saying all be it other men draw it to the dwelling to
gether of man and wife, and other to the love that ought to be between them /
to us it seems / that these two things were chieffly commanded us in this
law. First that the housbande should evermore / with out any departing,
stick to his wife, Second, that no son should mary with his mother, nor no
daughter with her father. But for this thing, that is to say, because the
strength and power of marriage is such, that it gleweth fast to gether with
streite and most holy bond the man and the woman, and does make of them /
that be.ij. several and distinct persons / one body and one flesh? therefore
shall man leave his father and his mother, and shall stick to his wife / that
is to say / man shall absteyne from the marriages of father and mother / nor
shall not disclose their foulenes, nor shame them, against the holiness and
chastity of marriage, and against natural honest and shamefacidnesse, and
against reverence, which by nature is due unto them. For seeing that those
persons be joined most nigh unto us / long syns / by the bond of bloudde and
co^sanguinite / to whom also nature teaches us, that we should owe other love
/ shamfacydnes, and reverence / be side the love and reverence of marriage,
truly if they should join them self to us by marriage / both the cause / why
marriage was ordined / should lack the chiefeste and best end / nor should not
take effect, and shamefacydnes, honor, and reverence natural should be
vyolate and broken, contrary to all comelynes and goodly behauour.

And that this was the very reasone, and intent of the Leuiticall prohibitions
/ this thing plainly declares. For god / did put to the cause of the
forbyddyngis after the^ / which is this. For it is the foulenes or shame of the
father, and it is the foulenes and shame of the brother / and so forth: so
that if one would ask, why it is not lauful for us to mary our stepmother, to
discover her foulness / there it is answered, For her foulenes is the fathers
foulenes, which is one body and one flesh with the father. And if a man
would demand again / why it is not laufull to discover the foulness of thy
father, the answer is by cause he is nieste of blood to the, to whom thou
must before al other do honor and reverence / and contrary to do him sham and
villainy / it is an vnlouinge and not to be spoken deed. And plainly so did Sem
and Iaphet judge / which tought by the prescriptes of nature / before any law
was written / covered them self with a cloak, and going backewarde did hide
and cover their fathers priuities / by cause they would not se their faders
privy members. And so doing they had their fathers blessing, and Came had
his curse. On this manner ought tho prohibitions, that we should not marie our
brothers wife. etc. to be weyed and examined. For seeing our brothers wife is
one flesh and bloudde with her husband, and he likewise one flesh and
bloudde with his brother, it follows well / that the brother and the brothers
wife, be not.ij. but one flesh and blood, and so consequently, that they can
not be joined to gether by marriage, saying that it is necessary before they
mary, that they be diverse flesh and bloudde, and so by marriage / be no
longer.ij. bodies / but be made one flesh and blood.

For matrimony is forbidden between persons of consanguinite and affinite /
because that between these persons there is a certain natural amity and
friendship / made by the institution of nature, which does not need the help
of marriage to strength it, but those persons ought to be coupled to strangers
and nothing of bloudde to them / to increasse amity / love / and charity,
which is increassed by marienge of strangers to gether. By cause that these
persons, which before were not bound to gether one to the other, by any
special bond, should now be made friends and lovers by the richtes and laws
of marriage / in the which frendeshyppe and love stands the fast knyttynge
to gether of hartis and minds / and unity of wylles. And likewise as there
needs no marriage between them that be of consanguinitie and affinity to make
love and charity, and to be of one will and mind / no more there nedethe no
marriage for to make them of one flesh and bloudde. But those persons must be
coupled by marriage to them, that be strangers and nothing of their blood to
make mo persons of one flesh and one blood, that by this mean they / which
before were not bound one to an other naturally by any bond of carnal
conjunction, now by marriage should be made one flesh and one blood / by the
which marriage diverse persons be joined to gether and made one body. For by
carnal copulation the man and the woman be made one body, and by marriage they,
the which were twain before, be now no more tweyne but one flesh and
bloudde. The which reason also our savior Christ in his godspell / does not
abrogate nor take a way / but renueth it / saying: Therefore now they be no
more tweyn / but one flesh and bloudde. By the which words it is euidente
and plain enough, that the law in the book of Genesis / wherein it is said,
THAT a man should leave his father and mother and stick to his wife, does not
seem to be put as a rule of grant and license to mary in all other degrees /
only the father and mother except, but that it should rather teach us / that
the unite of flesh and bloudde / between man and wife ought to be
indissoluble and never to be broken. And that the same unite of flesh and
bloudde / seeing that it is among the parents and the children, between whom
also is naturally unite of persons, and that they be naturally as it were one
self same person, it does let marriage between them specially and generally
be twene all other, that be forbidden.

And this forbyddynge of marriage / by the means of UNITY of the flesh and
bloudde / if we will know how far it extendith / we must look for it in the
Leuiticall law. For all though / as Dunse wrytethe, even after the
multiplication or increasse of mankind, if they had perseuered and abydden in
their innocence and goodness / god would have forbidden other degrees beside
the first, (For truly there is nothing almost so necessary to men / as to
know the natural laws of marieng) yet for all that god has in no place, in
the old Testament / expressed those degrees so plainly / and showed how
far their bonds do exte^de, and what persons nature abhors to be married
to gether, as he has done in the Leuiticall.

And now to return back to our purpose / where as we left. Truly if it be
a point of chastity, and a point of natural love, not to discover the
dishonestie of thy brothers wife, and if these Leuitical laws command the to
do them this duty, this honor / and this reverence / and to restreyne thy
lust and desire of incest pleasure, from them / and to absteyne and keep back
thy hands from so filthy and abominable a deed: Finally if the same
prohibitions be greatly profitable to increasse and enlarge love and charity
between christian men, which love and charity by this thing chiefly does
increasse, if there be made fre^deshipe among them, which be not coupled
before by none other natural bond of love: plainly we must needs confess
and grant / that those Leuitical laws be fit and convenient to form and
order men's manners / and that they do agree with the teachinge of commune
Justice, or honesty and virtue / and that they belong to the deeds and duties
of the moral virtues. For they truly forbydde the / that thou discover not the
foulnes and dishonestie of thy brothers wife / for the which thing our lord
reproves and dampneth both the Chananeis / and also the Egyptions. wherefore
if thou discover it / streicht thou haste broken the rule and the order of
virtue. And the law of nature, and natural reasone, as soon as they be
illychtenedde with the law of god / they shall cry out against the / and
thou must needs be called plainly an euel an and vnreuerent man to thy kyn /
and an inceste person. For who will deny, but that piete and chastity, and
holy keeping of marriage / cleannes, shamfacidnes of nature, shame / reverence
toward our kynsfolke / and spreddynge abroad of love and charity / be
contained under the rule of common Justice or virtue? The which virtues all /
no doubt, were the cause, why these prohibitions were ordyned, and they be the
things / that of them self be honest / and are to be beloved and desired for
them self, and do promote and help a man to the obteynynge of the eternal
bliss. Al be it truly there be many other moral resons or virtuous and
honest causes / which a man may gether / partly of the very nature and
qualities of the dignity or worthynes of marriage, of subduynge or repressynge
of bodyly pleasure / and partly of comlynesse / and partly of other
circumstances / which were the cause / without doubt / why these prohibitions
were ordyned. And seeing the causes / why these things should be forbidden, be
so honest and necessary: truly the forboddes and laws them self must
needs also be honest and necessary.

But it passes man's capacity to enter over far i^ to the cou^sailes of god,
beginner (...) For saying love and charity is the mark / perfection, and end
of all the hole law of the gospel / and the law of the gospel is the law
of love and charity: and seeing that Christ took most thought and care for
this thing / to encreasse among us love and charity: and ageine seeing that he
him self did command us / that our justice and goodness should pass the
Justice of the Scribes and Phariseis, And be such justice as a pure just man
ought to have / and our chastity likewise: Plainly if Christ would have
except us from the bonds of these most holy laws / so that they should have
no power in these days upon christian men, where as we can not deny, but
they have had power and strength among the Jews in time passed: forsothe
beside many other absurd and unreasonable things, these.ij. chieffly should
follow. The one / that the old law, and Moses, the auctour thereof, should be
far more perfect than Christ / and his new law. The the other / that Christ
him self should seem to have given more large and fre liberty to fylthy lust
and pleasure even unto us / which be christian men and spiritual people / and
that live by the spirit of Christ / and by the holy ghost, than he did give
before time to the carnal Iues. The which.ij. things, it is evident and
plain, that they be most absurd, and as much against all reason as can be.
For Moses never ordined nothing / that does lead a man immediately and
streicht to any virtue or moral perfection, but the same thing is also
commanded orels confirmed in the law of the gospel, by Christ him self,
other by express words, orels so, that it might be understand. And all that
ever do expoune this place of Matthewe, where he says, I am not come to break
the law / but to fulfill it, do show this thing as evidently as can be: For all they, with one voice / and with one spirit or mind / do agree to this
thing / that as Christ did take awei none of those laws / that were but
signs or tokens / or shadows of things to come, but rather did fulfill them,
and that by.iii. means: First because he did finysshe and end the fygures of
the old law: Second / because he did perform them in deed: Third because
he declared, what they meaned: Eue^ likewise he did fulfill all the moral
precepts / both as touching the perfect knowledge and understanding of
virtue and goodness, which he had and also taught it us: and ageine as
touching the execution and doing according to the same knowledge: and more
over as touching the relyfe and remedy, whereby he saved mankind from
everlasting damnation after the fall of Adam, or else, as Duns says, in other
words / Christ did not take a wey the moral law of Moses, but only did
declare it more plainly then the Iues did understand it / and did make and
add to more perfect reamedies for our salvation then Moses. For thus says
saint Augustine, By cause, says he, the Iues understood manslaughter / to be
nothing, but only the sleinge of a man's body, whereby he should lose his life,
and because they thought and understood, that adultery or fornication was only
the unlawful bodily copulation with a woman / Christ opened and taught / that
all and every ill motion, purpose / will, or consent to do our brother harm,
is compted for a kind of manslaughter, and that every unlawful desire to
bodily pleasure is fornication and adultery. Again / THESE PROUD folk /
which justify them self / and in their own conceit think them self good,
the law has got them in her bonds and danger / by their gylte and fault of
transgression or breakyng the law, and so the law increasseth their syn / in
that it byddeth them to do that / which they be not of power to fulfill / and
therefore the justice or goodness, that the law does teache us / is fulfilled and
performed by the spirit of Christ. And because truly it is hard even for
them, that be under the grace of god / and be ruled by the grace of god to
fulfill and utterly to keep this, that is written in the law: Thou shalt not
desire: Christ became the sacre pressed / and by the sacrifice or offering up
his body does get us perdon / remission / and forgyuenesse of our sins / and
so he does fulfylle the law in this point for us / so that that thing /
which we be not able to do our selfs, because of our infirmite and weakness,
is recovered and made up by the perfect goodness of him, which is our heed /
and al we christian folk members to the same heed. For the hole church of
Christ or al christian people make one body, whereof Christ is heed. To the
which sentence agreethe also saint Ireneus / Our lord, says he, did not
fordo the natural precepts of the law / by the which a man is justified and
made good / the which law even syns it was given / all they keep, that were
justified by their faith / and pleased god. Our lord, I say, did not adnull
them, but he did extend and enlarge them, ye and fulfilled them / or made them
perfect, as is plain by his own words / which be these. It was said to the
Iues in the old laws / thou shalt not commytte adulterye / but I say unto
you, that who so ever does look upon an other man's wife / with mind and will
to meddle with her, has committed adultery now al ready euin in his heart. All
these words truly, says Ireneus, do not contrary nor anull these things,
that were written before in the old law, as they which follow Marcion say /
but fulfill and make them perfect / as Christ him self says, Except your
iustenes and goodness pass the justice and virtue of the scribes and Phariseis
/ you shall not have the king dome of heaven. And wherein, says Ireneus, should we
pass and excelle the Scribes and the Phariseis? First truly that we should
believe, not only in the father / but also in his son, which is now
manifestly known among us. Moreover that we should not only speak well /
and after the learning of Christ, but also do according to the same, which the
scribes and Phariseis did not: which sometime spoke well / and did not
thereafter. Last of all, that we must abstain, not only from ill deeds, but
also from the thoughts, wylles / and desires of all evil. And as for these
things he taught not as contrary to the law, but put them unto it to fulfill
and make it up / and to root in us the iustifications and perfectnes of the
law. For where as Christ did co^mande us to abstein / not only from those
things / that were forbidden by the old law, but also from the noughty lusts
/ desires / and will of the same: this thing is not contrari to the law / as
we said before / nor breketh not the law / but fulfilleth and increasseth the
law.

Therefore by cause all the natural precepts be commune to us and to them /
and we be as well bound unto them / as they were among them, trewly they had
their beginning and first springynge up / in us they took their full perfectnes.
For truly to submit our self unto god, to follow his word and commandment,
and above all things to love him / and to absteyne from all evil doing / and
all other like things, which be common both to them and to us / show and
witness, that both they and we have one self same god, which as he did
first begin such laws, so he did never after adnull them / but did fulfill
and make them more perfect / and did increase, and enlarge them among us
christians and faithfuls. And to this purpose writes saint Augustyne also.
Certeynly, says he, no man should doubt / but that the old law of god /
which has touched us such things, as belong to virtue and to good manners,
is as necessary for us now to lead and instruct our life withal / as it
was at that time to the people of the Iues. For who will say, that that
commandment, which is written in the old law: That who so ever has found
any thing / he must restore it unto him / which has lost it, and many
other like, by the which we learn to live louyngely and virtuously, do not
belong unto us, that be christian men, and specially the.x. commandmentes,
which are contained in the two tables of stone. For who is so wicked / to say,
that he ne will keep the commandments of the old law, because he is a
christian man / and therefore is not under the law, but fre and under grace?

To the which thing agrees Marcus Marulus Euangelistarius, seyenge, That
what so ever is in the law, that belongs to the instruction and ordrynge of
our life and of our manners, ought as well to be observed among us, that be
now new men in Christ, as it was among the Iues and the old men, that were
in time passed, and that we ought to make it commune with the godspel / and to
take it as a part of the godspell / and that of the moral precepts, both of
the new testament and the old / we ought to say as David says: The words
of god be tried and pure words.

Nor truly it is not with out maruailous great reason, why that moral
precepts of the old law should still yet endure, and should bind christian
men to keep them. For as saint Thomas says, Every man / as soon as he is
lyghtened by the law of god / has a certain natural motion or inclination
planted in him, for this purpose / that he may do according to virtue. for
every thing naturally is inclined to do that work / which is agreeable with
the propre nature of it: as fire to heat. Now man's soul / folowinge reason /
is the chief part of the nature of man / which lichtened with the word of
god, teaches, that we should do tho things only / which of their own selves
be good and vertuos. For truly every man's own reasone, lichtned by the word of
god, does naturally teach him / that he should live vertuosly and honestly: And
plainly / seeing that all moral precepts in the old testament do nothing,
but command vertuos deeds / by the which the soul of man may order it self
well, as it ought to do, not only to god, but to his neihgbour alhso: terfore
Christ did not adnulle any of these precepts by his coming. For even as the
grace and favor of god / does presuppose our nature, yea makes it full and
perfet / so truly the godspel did never break and adnulle the natural laws /
but did stablisshe and make them perfect / and brocht them again to their
first perfectness of nature, in so much that what so ever moral precepts
of the old law, do agree with the law of nature, which Paul says, is
written in our hertes, do evermore endure and remain in their power and
authority, nor no christian man is fre and lose from them, but all persons /
as concerning the plain understanding of them, of necessite be subject and
bound unto them / although they had never be ordined by no man's law. For all
the laws of the old testament / which so ever agree with the law of Nature
and with virtue, nor do not only withdraw the hand and body / but also the
mind and will of man / why should they not be received among christian men?

For god forbid / that any christian man should contracte such marriages /
which, as saint Augustyne writes before / even the cruel hethens and
barbarous people, without all ciuilite has for very honesties sake, evermore
abhorred. The which unlawful marriage Christ did so greatly abhor, that he
seemed rather to go about to draw back the bonds of marriages to the old and
first state of nature when it was create. And for this cause he brought
marriage home again to his first beginning / that one man should have but one
wife, and that he should be bound to keep her evermore / and never to put her
away: For because, says Christ, it was so at the beginning. and he would have
made and brought to pass, if the present miserable wretched state of our exile
and banysshing would have suffered it, that there should have been no foulenes
nor fylthynes in the works of marriage, and that it should be even so / as
saint Augustine says, it was in the beginning of the world / THAT all our
marriages should be so clean / that they micht well become them, that should live
in the felicite of Paradise / both having childerne, that they should love /
and no fylthy pleasure / that they should be ashamed of.

Furthermore whereto should Christ have antiquate and annulled the Leuitical
laws / the which streicht after he would inspire in to the fathers of his
first and primitive church / and would command them to make those laws of
new? would Christ have exempte us from the law of god / and that in tho
things / which have so evident and plain token of virtue in them, unto the
which he would streichte after that we should be bound / by the decrees of
the Church?

And finally / why did the sacre holy church forbid us to do those things,
but because it judged them / to be maruaylous foul / unhonest, and unclean*
But how or whereby may that / that is clean or honest be discerned and known
a sonder from that, that is foul and dishonest / but by the co^mandmentes of
god? For if the church had forbidden such maryages / and had judged them
foul and unclean, for none other thing / but by cause they were forbidden in
the old testament under the name of ceremonies / as diuersyte of meats / of
days / and of places / and such like things / as be forbidden in the old
testamente, it mycht be lefull to make an objection / and to lay against the
church that thing, which is said by god unto Peter in the acts of the
apostols / which would not eat of al manner of meats, but did forbere certain
meats / that were forbidden in the old law / unto whom god says thus: That
thing, which god has puryfied and made clean / call not thou it foul or
unclean.

But saying that the end, the intent / the pythe / the strength, the reasone
of these Leuiticall prohibitions do yet remain among christian men / and be
written in heaven / and evermore endure: truly a christian man / which does
take upon him more perfect faith, hope, and charity / than the Iue / must be
moved to keep these forbiddynges only by his feith / and by the holy ghost,
more tha^ the Iues by the letter and law. For god forbid / that the holy bond
of love and charity between kinsfolk / that the fast knotte of marriage which
in no wise oucht to be undone / and the working of the lively truth and of
reasone / which naturally move a man to goodness, should not be judged as
holy, as clean / as vnfilthy, as pure, as chaste, and as well to be observed
among christian men / as they were in time passed among the heathens / and
the Iues. And god forbydde / that christian men should change the liberty of
the spirit, in to the fylthines of the body. for if they that flee the foul
pleasures of the world / for the knowledge of our savior Jesus Christ / be
again entangled and overcome with the same / they be in worse case now than
they were before at the beginning. For it were better for them never to have
known the wey of justice and virtue / then after that they know it, to turn
away ageyn from that thing / that was given to them by a great and a holy
commandment. Certes if Noes son did not escape unpunished, for
discoueringe the foulenes of his father, nor the Egiptions / nor the Chananeis,
for the discoueringe of their own kynsfolke / and of them that were nigh of
their bloudde / for the which deed god, by his godly judgment and sentence /
did spue them out of their land, which were heathens: How shall a
christian man avoid the displeasure and vengeance of god, if he commit the
same things, that they were punisshed for. For know you this well / and take
good head of it, that no fornicator, nor lecher, nor fylthy person / shall
have heritage in the kyngedome of Christ and god.

Nor truly it needs not, that our adversaries should dema^de of us / why
Christ did not make express mention of the Leuiticall laws in the godspell,
if he would have had them lived and endured among us still after the Synagoge
or old law was deed. For truly he did not make express mention of them, by
cause he had commanded long before, that they should ever to come continue /
and never fail / saying that he does abhor such fylthy marriages / and
curses them not only among the Iues, but also among the heathins / meaning
/ that he will much more abhor them, if they be a monge chrystyan men.

And because he did command plainly in the gospel / that the justice and
goodness of us, that be christians / should pass the justice of the Scribes and
the Pharyseis / where in a general rule that we / which be called christian
men, should not be wors in any thing then the carnal people, but that we
should be better then they in all points.

Nor we must not think / that no thing is forbid by the law of god / but that
/ which is expresli and plainly set out in the gospel. For the apostols write
and publisshe many things, which they took of the very mouth of Christ / and
yet they be not written in the book of the new testament. And the catholic
and universal church has approved many things for gods laws / of the which
there is never a word spoken in the new testament, as is this / That
confession in no case ought not to be disclosed, and such other things. For
so does Dunse also prove / that the secret confession in the ear is of the
law of god, not by cause it is written in the new testament / but by cause it
can not be showed / when it was first begone. Plainly it is heresye to
affirm, that there is nothing gods law, but that, which a man may point
unto with his finger in the new testament. For by this means the sacraments
should be taken a wey, and should be received only by the constitution of man.
Nor truly there is no mention made in the new testament of the forbidding of
marriage between the father in law and the daughter in law, which thing
nevertheless to be forbidden by the law of god / saint Hierome does testifye.

And also if our adversaries will stycke and hold them to this, than let us
occupy vsurye / and let us give money by exchange / and require it ageyn
with usury, let us also have many wives / and let us couple our self with all manner of bestes / nor let us not pay the tithes of all our fruits to the
prestes / nor let us not confess our sins to them / nor let us not go to
them / when so ever there is any doubt between bloudde and bloudde / between
lepri and no lepri. For there is none of these expressly commanded or
forbidden in the godspel, or in the writing of the apostols / but for to bind
us to the keeping of them, be cyted and alleged the wrytynges of the Prophettes.

But this thing did lychtly deceive them / that be against the liberty and
fredome / which we have by the gospel, because they did not know the
difference between the new testament and the old / the gospel and the law,
Christ and Moses: which if they had known very well, they should not have been
so foul deceived and blinded in this matter. And contrary because they did not
discuss them, and seek them out to the vttermoste / nor did ponder and way
them so diligently as they should have don / we se / that by this means they
were brought in to this error / that they thought / that every thing, which
is not expressly forbidden in the new testament, is laufull for christian men
to do. By the which error, we do think / that the same man of Corynthe was
deceived / which married his stepmother. For seeing that he hard the liberty
of the godspell / by the which we were made free from the law of Moses /
greatly commended and preysed of the apostols / and knew that it was
forbidden by no law of the godspell / to marye whom so ever he would,
streychte he, abusing the said liberty, did against the Leuiticall law /
marie his fathers wife. But he was most rychtfully condemned of Paul / not
only because he had broken Moses law / which forbids it, but because he
was disobedient to the honesty of nature / which natural honesty the
godspell has ever approved. and it should be such a pestilent exemple of a
most leude liberty among christian men / as even among the hethins /
because of the reverence of nature, could in no wise be suffered to be don.

AND TRVELY HITHERTO, most gentle reder, we have serched out the holy secresy
of the scripture of god, devoutly and reverently, for this intent only, with
peyn and labor to seek out and to mayntein the truth, and such arguments
and reasons / as seemed after our judgment to make most for this matter, we
have soucht them out of the definition and very substance and nature of those
things, that we treat upon, whereby thou may plainly perceive / most gentil
reder / that these Leuiticall laws / which forbydde / that we should marie
our brothers wife / be the laws of god. And more over laws moral / longing
to virtue and good manners / and not judicial. And this is no doubt / seeing
that they have in them natural reasone / fetched from the beginning of the
world, even out of the secret ordinances of nature. For we have proved by
the auctorite of god / or of holy scripture, that as it was ordyned of the
most best mind, which is god / even so it was ordined upon the most best
reason and consyderation: that is / only for a zele of chastity / of natural
shamfacidnes / and other virtues / that no man should marye his brothers wife.
we have showed how against nature / how fylthy and abominable it is / and
utterly unmeet for a christian man / to contracte marriages in that degree. we
have showed how greatly contrary it is to the order of love / and of the
reverence, that should be between kynsfolke / and what a confusion it should
cause of names of kynrede, and how much it is ageyn the increase of love and
charity: we have showed / that holy and devout christian ears / do abhor
it / and can not suffer to here it spoken: we have showed / that beside the
great punisshmentes and vengeance, that god takes on men in this life, that
also the punisshement of the everlasting fire of hell abides them / which
be not afraid to commit this syn. By the which reasons without doubt it is
evident and plain, that these Leuiticall prohibitions be the laws of god /
and moral / because they co^mande those things to be don / that be honest /
and forbydde tho things, that be foul and inhoneste, and such things, as
the natural reasone of man clered by the lychte and bryghtnes of the word of
god / shows / that they ought to be done / or not done, according to the
rule of general justice / otherwise calledde virtue and honesty, and so they
be of strength and auctorite to bind man to keep them, even by the
instruction of reasone / so illychtned and restored / and that, though they
were never commanded by none other law.

The seventh Chapter.
Now seeing that the commun consent of all writers / and expouners of man's
law and gods law, specially those that be approved by the judgment of the
church / has steadfastly holden and obtained, as a thing to be taken for a
treuthe, that all the moral precepts of gods law, do yet endure sacre and
holy / and by the law of god do bind us so streytely / and of such
necessite, that they be not under the power of the church / and that no
person, under god him self, can release the streite bond of them / and lose
from them / whom it pleseth him: Truly it is evident, that no pope can by any
dispensation give license / that a man should mary her / that was his brothers
wife: the which, as we have showed you before, is forbidden / and that the
prohibicion is both the law of god / and the law moral grounded upon
honesty and virtue. But because that this our conclusion may stand yet the
more steadfastly against al cauillacions / false accusations, and vnrichtfull
out cries and sclaunders of all persons / we will assaye to declare and
stablysshe these things more largely / both by other reasons / and by other
sayenges of auctours. In the which thing we be all most overcome with the
multitude and great noumbre of them / so that scante we can tell, where we
shall first begin.

But let this be the first / That all precepts / which be commanded by the
law of god / and the law moral / do bind us to do them / so that without
remedy we must needs keep them, if we will be saved. For such co^mandeme^tes
do so express and declare the mind of god, our lawmaker, and be so grounded
upon the precise rule and teachinge of common justice (which rule of common
Justice or virtue came of the will of god / that is most just / and most
best, to form and order universally the manners and life of man) and finally
have so much of the nature of very true virtue in them, that there can chance
no case, nor no reasonable cause be imagened, but that if we do contrary to them
/ streicht way we do contrary to the will and pleasure of god / which
specially regards the commun health and salvation of all / and do peruerte and
turn up set down the order of very richt and honesti, destrue all the
nature and course of virtue / and finally it can not be chosen, but that we
must fall foulye and wretchedly into shamefulll vice and sin. In so much
that what so ever pope will go about to dyspense with the bond of them, he
truly shall do nothing else / but peruerte the order of justice, or virtue /
and break the course of virtue, and give leude liberte to sin / that is, to
abuse his authority and power to destruction / not to building and setting
up / contrari to the saying and mind of thapostol. For thus using his power,
he should destroy virtue / and set up vice. For what license can be given? or
what recompense can there be, for this, that a man might have liberty to sin
/ and not to keep him self from vice? what perdon or dispensation can there
be, that god should not be worshypped / and it to be no sin? what cloak or
color can be found, that a man mychte commytte adulterye, but that the self
same color should turn up so down all virtue / and publyke justice? what
power may make it laufull for us to murdre and steal, these things keeping
their names / and their natures of murdering and stealing? Now then seeing
that nothing can perteine more to the.x. commandmentes, nor more strongly move
the judgment of the richt reason, then can natural reverence / the holiness of
chastity, the increase of love and charity / the holy keeping of marriage /
shamefacydnes and love toward them, that be of our blood and our affinite /
and finally al other vtues, which as we showed sufficiently before / were the
cause / that these prohibitio^s were made / we ought to believe, that with them
truly the pope can in no wise dispense. And this thing is easy to se /
because that the reason of these Leuitical laws is such / that in no case it
can not be disseuered from them, by cause the reasone is grounded upon such
natural virtue and honesty / which must never be left undone. yea and seeing
that now there is such multitude both of mankind and womankynde / there can
be no case imagyned for the breaking of those prohibitions, which for any
profet or need / should do so much good, as is the goodness / that comes by
kepinge of the same.

yea and more over / many witnesses of scripture do evidently prove, that in
these things / which be commanded by the moral law of god, we should ever
do and teach that, that is commanded: having no regard of sclaunder or of
necessite. among the which be these places chiefly, HE that loses any of
these least commandments / shall be called the least in the kingdom of
heaven. Again this. IF thou haste brought thy offering up even unto the altar /
and there doste remember, that thy brother has any thing against the* leave
thy offering there, and go thy ways / and first reconcile thy self to thy
brother / and be at a grement and accord with him and then come and offer up
thyn offringe. Also this place, LET the dead bury the dead. Ageyn / IF you
knew what this is that god says, I VVIL have piete / mercy and compassion,
love and charity / and not sacrifice, you would never have condemned the
innoce^tes or the fautles. Ite^, VVHER fore do you break the commandment of
god / for your laws traditions and teachinges. Ite^, COME behind me Satanas.
for thou sauerest tho things, that be of man and not of god. Item, SCRIPTURE
may not be losed or dispe^sed with. Item, THE prophetical scripture belongs
not to the interpretation of man, and such like. Of the which placis it is
evident and plain, that no service or obedyence, no sacrifyce nor offering / no
work / be it never so good to our sight and fantasye / nor no tradition or
ordinance of man / is acceptable to god / if that it withdraw us by any manner
of thing / from the observation and kepinge of the commandments of god /
and the moral precepts / as these Leuiticall prohibitions be.

And these things saint Cyprian also / proves / and confirms / beside those
auctors, that we have rehearsed before. For he says, it is necessary, that in all our works we be subject and obedient to the co^mandeme^tes of god, nor no
man for favor or respect to any person in such things may grant any perdon
/ where as the law of god commands the contrary. Also Basilius proves the
same. Because, says he, that among all causes, that chance among us /
whether they be i^ words or in deeds, some be distinctely determined in holy
scripture, by the word of god, some be passed over and not spoken of at all:
As for those, which be written in scripture / there is no license at al
granted to any man, either to do that, that is forbidden, or to leave that
undone / which is commanded. For our lord him self has given this
commandment, and says under this wise / AND keep thou this word / which I
command the this day. Thou shall another put any thing to it / nor thou shalt
not take any thing from it. yea and moreover there shall be a terrible
expectation of the day of judgment / and of the fire / that shall come from
heaven, which shall consume all them / which have been so bold to do any such
thing. And the said Basilius in another place says, That he, which is a
p^sident / and a spiritual ruler oucht to be as a minister of Christ / and a
distributor and almosynar of the misteres of god / and to fere lest he should
other speak or command any thing beside the will of god / and beside that /
which is evidently commanded in holy scripture, lest he should be found as a
false witness of Christ / or a thief of sacre holy things, other bringyng in
any thing / which is strange unto the doctrine of god / orels leauinge out some
of those things / which be to the pleasure of god.

Also saint Ambrose makes to this purpose, for he, expouninge, in the.iij. of
Genesis / the answer of Eve, says thus. The process of all this present lesson
teachethe us / that we ought another to take away any thing from the
commandments of god, nor yet to put more unto them. For if saint John^
gave this judgment of his own writings, saying thus, IF any man shall add
unto them / god shall cast unto him those plages and vengeances, which be
written in his book of revelations: and who so ever shall take away any thing
from the words of this prophecy / god shall wype his part clean out of the
book of life: How much more must we be ware, that we take away nothing from
the commandments of god / nor put nothing to them?

Also saint Barnarde makes for this purpose. I understand, says he, that
thing to be so necessary / that it can not be broken, not that, which is
ordined by manne / but by god / and can not be changed in any case / except
it be by god / which made it.

And a litell after / in the same book / the said saint Barnard says, That he,
which is of less power, can not dispense in those things / which be ordyned
by him / that is of greatter power.

And also pope Fabian makes for this purpose. He truly, says Fabian, that
dredeth god, does not consent in any wise / to do any thing contrary to the
godspell, contrary to the apostols / contrary to the Prophettes, or contrary
to the ordynaunces of holy fathers.

Also in this thing agrees Isodore, and says: If that he, which has rule,
do him self, or command any other to do / any thing / that is forbidden of
god / orels if he do leave undone, or bid any man leave undone that, which god
has commanded: the saying of the holy apostoll saint Paul must be rehearsed
unto him, YEA if we our own self / says saint Paul / or an angel of heaven
do teach you any otherwise / tha^ we have touched / cursed be he: And if any
man do forbid you that, which (...) should do against god / obeieng the judge /
when he commands: much more then should he do against god, following only
the dispensation and license of the judge. Saint Thomas also is of the same
opinion. for he in many places of his works, which partli we have before
rehearsed, does plainly show / that the prohibition of marriage / as concerning
degres of consanguinite and affinite / which be expressed in the old law, do
belong to the natural and moral precepts. And that the pope can in no case
dispe^se with those things / which belong to the natural law / and to the
law of god.

with saint Thomas agrees Alexander de Hales, Dunse, Richard de Media villa,
Durandus, Albertus magnus, Franciscus Maro, Gerson, Gabriell Biel, Herueus,
Jacob Almain, Barnardus de Trilla, Antoninus Florentinus / and many other
beside these / which plainly do say, and hold stiffely / that it can not be
proved by no good richt / that the pope can in any case dispe^se with any of
those prohibicio^s / that be made by the law of god and by the law of nature.
For they say, that it is not reasonable, that they / which be of like power /
should have power one over the other / tha^ it should be much against reason /
that the inferior should lose or dispense with that the superior has bound:
or bind men to that thing, which the superior has not bound men unto.
FVRTHERMORE beside these reasons of natural honesty / shame, and reverence /
which we have showed before, an other cause of this Leuiticall prohibicion,
That a man should not marie his brothers wife / is the will of god, which is the
very and true Justice. For god will not this thing or any other, because it
is just and richt, but therefore it is just and richt / because god wylleth it
/ as saint Augustyne says. Therefore seeing that from this deed, another the
ylnes of it can be taken away / nor any goodness put unto it by any other manner
of means / but that the mind and will of the lawemaker must be changed:
truly there can none dispense with such law / but he that shall be able to
change also the will and mind of the lawemaker. For the dyspensation causes,
that he, with whom we dispense / is not bound to that thing / to the which
before it apered / that he was bound by the words of the law. But no pope of
Rome can change the will of god. For he / saying he is Christis vicar, oucht to
follow Christ / and to do as Christ did, and not to contrary him in any
thing, nor in any thing to swerve from his doing: and Christ another did
nothing, nor said nothing / but only that he had taken of his father / nor
brake nothing of the^ / which his father commanded and would have done. And
saying that the pope has taken of Christ / sheep and lambs to feed with the
learning of the church, or of the gospel, and is only made a minister and
Almoysnar or dispenser by Christ of the sacraments / which be ordined of god
and Christ, Finally seeing our lord did command him to teach all men to
keep all manner of things, what so ever he had commanded them: god forbid,
that the Pope of Rome should think it lefull for him to change the will of
god, and that he had power to couple those persons to gether by marriage,
whom the law of nature and of Moses / whereof god him self is the auctor, has
forbidden to be coupled to gether. For if he should do it, plainly he should
not be that blessed and faythefull almosynar and dispenser of the word of god,
gyuynge in time measure of corn / by the which men's spirits should be
refresshed, and their souls should live, but he should rather be a wretched
unhappy waster and a spender, that shall be cast out in to extreme darkness /
and should be the envious fellow, which sowed among the good corn / that is
to say / i^ the scripture of god plenty of Cockel or Darnel / and such other
wedes / whereby the souls should wax lene and perisshe for ever. For Christ
him self says, HE, that has my COMmandeme^tes / and keeps them, that is he,
that Loves me: and he that LOuith me not / does not keep my commandementes.
Upon the which saying Cyril writes thus. These things, says he, ha^ge
merucilously well to gether / so that the tone must needs follow of the the other.
For if to keep the co^mandme^tes of god, is to love god, it must needs be /
that to break the co^mandeme^tes of god / is to hate god. and seeing that no man
can love god, and break the co^mandementes of god: how then by any manner of
just and laufull cause may the Pope give license, that a man should discover
the foulness of his brother / the which deed nature and the laws of god do
abhor? except he will run into that most rychtefull condemnation / which
Paul threteneth them / which do evil things / that there may come some good
of them. Truly pope Zosimus says / That the auctorite of this seat of Rome
can change nothing ageynste the decrees of the holy fathers.

Also pope Leo writes to Anatholius and says, that the ordinance of the
Nicean counsel could in no case be dispensed withal at any time.

And so Isodor, in the book of the councels, cites / that pope Damase says:
Because that such persons may (and that not without reason, says he) be
thought to blaspheme and speak irreverently against the holy ghost / which
constreined by no necessite / but of their own pleasure / and of a frowardenes
/ do take upon them any thing, that is against the holy canons, or else consent
willyngly to other / that will do any such thing: Therefore the rule of the
holy canons / which be consecrate by the spirit of god / and by the reverence
and allowyng of all the world / we oucht faithfully to know, and we must
handle them diligentely, lest that we do break by any means (which god
forbid) the statutes and decrees of the holy fathers, without inevitable
necessity.

And the self same Pope Damas would not take upon him to determine the cause of
Bonosius the bishop, by cause that the Synod of Capua had committed it be
fore to be examined of other judges, plainly showing, that it was not his
part to meddle with those matters, in the which the Synod had meddled before.

And finally pope Hilarious would have his decrees confirmed by the counsel. By
all the which reasons it is evident and plain, that euin in those laws /
which be only the constitutions and ordinances of the holy fathers, the Pope
can not dispense without in euitable necessity / and such necessite as can
not be other wise avoided. Nor truly it is not convenient for a prince or a
reuler to desire to abrogate and adnull without consideration and cause / that
thing, that a another prince or governor has ordyned with great study and
pain, and for weighty causes: how much less than oucht that to be suffered /
that other the pope him self does against the law of god, or gives license
to other men to do it? Specially seeing it is not found in no place of gods
law, nor yet in the ordynances of the fathers / that any such power is
granted to the pope. For by these words, WHAT so ever he shall lose upon
earth, shall be loosed in heaven. And WHAT so ever he shall bind in earth,
shall be bound in heaven / he has doubtless power given him: not whereby he
micht revoke the law of god / or break and dispense with any part of it: but
he has power to bind men's sins / and that not generally and in all cases
/ but first it must be supposed / that he uses his Keye with such discrecion
and richt judgment, as he ouchte to do. Therefore Christ, before he spoke
these forsayde words / said thus as folowethe: I, SHALL give the, the keys /
that is to say / I shall give the power to discern and judge leprye / from no
leprie / and power to let in / and shut out from the kyngedome of heaven,
all such as thou haste so judged by rychte. And now, what discrecion / and
rychte judgment should this be / if the Pope would take upon him for to
coupul to gether in marriage, by his dispensacion those persons, whom the law
of god and of nature does forbid to come together, seeing, GOD has commanded,
that his commandments shulden be kept to the vttermoste point? Truly
though in the ordering of those acts / which of them self be indyfferent /
and another good nor badde / his Keye of power in a manner reuleth more thanne
his Keye of learning and science: yet for all that / in the determinacion and
ordering of thoo things / that perteyne to our believe / to honesty / to
virtue / and to good manners / it is contrary. For in these things his power
determines nothing, but that lerning has determined / and power here oucht in all cases to be ruled and ordered by lerning. For here if power in the least
thing that can be, be contrary to the keye of Learning, that is the cnowlege
of the law of god / the determination should be nothing worth. For if the Pope
would by any manner of power determyne any thing other wise than lernyng, that
is the cnowlege of goddis law / would have it be determined, other in our
faith, or in good manners: his determinacion should be utterly nothing worth
at al / yea it should be lefull for every christian man, that knows this / to
cry out against it / and all to be spyt and be spue it / and to reprove and
damn it as heretical. For if any power do command the to do any thing,
that thou ought not to do / then doubtless contemn and dispice that power,
as saint Austine says. For, says he, take heed of the degrees / that be in
worldly things. For if the Marshall of the host bid us do any thing /
shall we do it / if it be against the grande captain? Again, if the graunde
Captain bid us do any thing, and the king or Emperor commands us to do
a another / do thou doubt / but that we must obey the commandment of the
king or the emperor / and contemn the commandment of the grande Captain?
Therefore if the king or the emperor bydde one thing / and god an other, we
must obey god, and conte^ne and not regard another king nor emperor. Therefore
we may not think / that the Popes license in the degrees forbidden by goddis
law, is just and a richtfull dispensation? but rather an vnrichtfull and an
unreasonable dissipation / and mysorderynge of the laws of god. For truli god
does not allow such maryages, which be ageynste his own law / nor yet such
ouchte not to be called true marriages. For that oucht not to be judged
marriage, which is made ageynste the law of god. But when it is ones known /
it must needs be amended, as saint Ambrose says.

YEA AND beside all this, though we would even grant never so much, that the
popes have been wont of custom to put to, or to take awey from the law of god
/ and so to make expositions and restreyntes upon goddis law: yet for all that
the doctors of the law do think / that it is lefull for them / but only
in.ij. cases.

One case, when that one law of god is expouned and restreyned by an other
law of god / as this commandment, THOU shall not slay / is lymytted and
expouned thus / that it is lefull to slay mysdoers. An other case / when the
pope of a just and a leful cause, and such as is without sin / does put to /
or take away some part / from the law of god, as to this commandment: IN
the mouth or witness of.ij. or.iij. stands all the proof, the pope for a
just cause, uses sometime to put more witness than.ij. or.iij.

But the pope can by none of these.ij. weyes expoune or restreyne this
Leuiticall commandment, That a man should not marie his brothers wife. For
all though that it was limited and restreyned before times of god in the
Deuteronomi, yet for all that because afterward the said restreint was taken
awey of god him self by the coming of Christ: truly the pope can not bring
up again now in these days the same restreynt. For if the pope now of days
could by dispensation cause / that a man micht mary after the law of the
Deuronomi, his brothers wife, which does dye having no issue, for to reyse
up sede to his brother: without doubt he should make christian me^ at this day
to follow the Iues cerimones and supersticiousnes / which the pope can not do,
no more then he can cause that we should keep their sabbat dai / or that there
should be circumcisyon, as saint Gregory says. After that the grace and favor
of almichtie god appeared, the co^mandme^tes of the law / which were spoken by
figure and mystically / can not be kept, as we have showed you before of the
sabbat day / and of circu^cisio^ / and other figural or mystical laws, as is
also that co^ma^dme^t of the Deuteronomi, That we should marie our brothers
wife. wherefore if the pope would bring up this now among us christian men /
he could not. For he can by no mean bring up ageyn the customs and
ceremonies of the Iues / which were abrogate and clean taken awey by the
coming of Christ. This saint Paul proves, saying, IF you be circumcised /
Christ shall profet you nothing at al / which did speak against Peter to his
face / because he co^streined the ge^tils to follow the Iues ceremonies. And
also saint Thomas says / that when thapostol does publisshe the law of god, it
is not leful for the pope to dispense / as for an exemple, where the apostoll
says, IF you be circumcised / Christ shall profette you nothing, whose
saying also Ioannes de Turre cremata does follow. Therefore the pope can not
restreyne this Leuitical law in the first case, that is, by cause it is
restreyned by the Deuteronomi law / which is but a mystery and a ceremony.

And again in the second case, that is to say, for a cause or consideration
the pope can much less dispense in this Leuiticall law / seeing there can be
no cause found lefull enough, and that should be without sin / for the
which he may dispense. For to discover the foulenes of our brother / is in the
manners of men foul and shameful / and such couplynge is called inceste: and
incest is as grievous a sin as can be. And therefore plainly euin as the pope
can not dispense, that a man may commytte adultery / or to keep a concubyne or
le^man / or to have many wives at ones, and in such other like, by cause they
be of them self, and by their own nature, evermore ill and nouchty: so another
in this kind of inceste marriage, where as is deadely sin after the law of
god / there can be no cause found / which can excuse that sin. For seeing
that honesty is cause of this prohibition / which is the contynuall companyon
of marriage, this kind of marriage plainly is to be thoucht so evil in the
manners of me^, and also so myscheuous in example / that it can not be
maintained in no case, another by man / nor by angel / nor by apostoll, nor by
any apostollyke man.

Nor let not the Pope here lay ageynste us his full power. For we grant / that
the Pope has in deed a fulle power, and not yet all thing so full as the
word souneth: so that this full power should be able to do any deed that is
possible to be done, or any thing that him lustethe to do / as though there
were no superior. For such power is only mete for Christ, according to that
sainge of Christ, UNTO me is given all power both in heaven and in earth / but
this power of the Pope is restreyned and drawn in / to tho things / which
belong to the pastoral or sheperdly cure of souls. And for ordering of this
power / because the pope is not such one / that can not sin, nor is not
confyrmed in grace / Christ has made his rule of the godspel / after the
which the pope should order all his doings: from the which rule of the
gospel if the pope would vary and swerve, and would grant any thing, that
should be contrary to the precepts of the same godspell / he does not follow
that power, that god has given him / nor god does not approve that, that he
does. And as for that, which Pope Innocent, and Pope Nicolas do say, That it
is not lefull for any man to judge of the judgment of the seat of Rome / nor
lefull for any man to revoke or reuerse the sentence or judgment of that seat
/ for because of the preemynence of the church of Rome: This saying of them
ought not greatly to move us. For we think / that tho words must be
understand thus: That it is not lefull for any inferior power to reason
indiscreetly on the judgment and determination of that seat / nor to affirm
and hold openly any thing contrary to that determination: except that it be
evident and plain / that the judgment of that seat be erroneous and wrong
(As master Gerson writith) And that it is not leful for any inferior person, to
judge as it were by auctorite upon the judgment and determinaitio^ made by the
pope, and as though he had jurisdiction and power over the pope, for by cause
of the preeminence of the seat of Rome. But if that any pope do decre any
thing against the law of nature and gods law: there if any man do judge and
reason of his determination and judgment wisely / discretly / and clarkely, and
not as it ware by auctorite / and does labor with all his might / that his
sentence and determination may be revoked and called again: This thing is
(as we think) so far of from sacrilege / pride / and presumption / or any
other vice / that we believe / there can be nothing more godly or more nere
unto the religyon of Christ. For does not the Church often times by recht and
good law / revoke correct and reprove the deeds and determinations of the
Popes / which have not been very well and conuenyently done of them, or does
it let to change them and make them better? yea furthermore, has not al so
mean bisshopes resisted and withsto^de the wrong and unreasonable sentencis
and co^mandeme^tes of the popes / not regardinge their cursings /
exco^municaotins, and al punissheme^tes / that the church does use? And
because we will not seek far in histories for an exemple in this matter / we
shall show you a thing or.ij. that was done here in England / and in France
here by.

Laurentius, successor to Austine in the archebysshopprike of Canturburye,
after that he had cursed Edbalde the king, for marienge of his stepmother /
could not be moved by no prayenge nor request of the Pope, nor by dread of
cursynge / to absoile the said king / till he had renounced, and forsaken
that fylthy and incest marriage. And Dunstan, archebesshop of the said seat /
folowinge the forsayde Laurence / after that he had excommunicat and cursed the
earl Edwyn / because he had married his brothers wife, could not be moved by no
means to obei the pope, that desired him / charged and commanded him most
sharply and streitely to assoyle the said Edwyn: until he had forsaken his
unlawful wife.

And more over it is written, that he was ever wo^t to have this saying in his
mouth: GOD forbid / that I should, for any mortal man, not regard the law of
my god.

And thus also Sampson / some time archebisshoppe of Rein / had leauer have
suffered the most extreme punisshementes, that could be / and al ieopardies of
excommunicacion and cursynge: then he would anoynte Alam, douchter to the earl
Theobald / for queen, whom at that time Jews the french king had married /
because he had divorced before / Alams sister from Philip, brother to the
said king Jews, by reason of consanguinite.

And no less worthy to be remembered is that / which Grosseheed / sometime
bishop of Lincoln did. For when Pope Innocent would have constreyned him to
make the Popes neueu a canon / which was an ungracious fellow, and utterly
unworthy and unmeet / he wrote ageyn these words. There can no man, says he,
being subject and feythfull to the seat of Rome / with clean and pure
obedience / and not cut of by division from the body of Christ / and from the
same holy seat, obey such commandments or any other manner enterprises /
from whense so ever they came, yea and though it were from the highest order of
angels, but he must and is bound of necessity both to speak against them /
and to fight and rebel against them to the vttermoste of his power. Therefore
reverend sir, for the duty of obedience and fidelite / that I owe to both my
parents and to the holy seat of Rome, and again because we both be joined
to gether / as members in one body of Christ: I, like a catholyke man / and as
one of the body of Christ / and like a good child, do not obey / but gaynsay
and rebel against those things, that be contained in your letter, because
they swerve as plainly as can be in to that forsayde sin / which is to our
lord Jesus Christ most abominable / and of it self most myscheuous and
pestilent, and utterly contrary to the holiness of the seat apostolye. Nor your
wisdom and discretion can not decree any sharp punisshment against me for
this cause / if you will do nothing / but that, which is rycht and reasonable.
Both by cause all my saying and doing in this behalf / is another geinsaieng /
nor geynstriuinge, or rebellion / but honor and reverence / such as a good
child owes to his father and his mother: and again because the holiness of
the seat apostolye can do nothing but that, which should be to edyfienge /
and not to destruction. O the great co^stancy / and the saying most comely,
for a christian bishop. For how perverse a thing / and what a confusion
should it be (as saint Barnarde says) by obeyeng to evil and nauchtie
co^mandeme^tes / wherein thou semest to be obedient to man / to show thy self
inobedie^t to god / which has forbidden all that is ill done? For if god
forbids that, which man commands, shall I here man, and be deaf and not
here god? Therefore (that we may come to our matt^ agein where as we left).
Truly if the pope do suffer / by his auctorite and power / incest marriages to
be made, or will not break them, when they be made, which (as Gregory says)
be abominable to god and to all good men / it shall be the duty of a loving
and a devout bishop / not only to withstand the pope openly to his face, as
Paul did resist Peter / because the pope verili is to be reprehended and
rebuked: but also with all fair means and gentylnesse, and learning, in time
and out of time / oucht to cry upon him / to rebuke / reprove / beseech /
exhort him / that the persons, so coupled to gether / may forsake such
maryages. And if they will not take the good learning and counsel of their
bishop, but will follow their own voluptuous pleasure / than at the last the
bishop ouchte to pluck forth his spiritual sword of excommunication and
cursyng, and to shake it upon such persons, and to be take them to the diuol,
to the punisshement of their flesh, so that their spirit or soul be saved
in the day of our lord Jesus / according to the co^maundment of Christ, and
the exemple of Paul. For else how shall these prelates do the duty of
bysshoppes and overseers, as they oucht to do, if that for the cruelte, and
thretes of the popes, they shall not dare call back their sheep in to the
way of truth, that be out of the wey and lost, for whom they shall give a
compte in the terrible and dredefull judgment of god? Or how shall they escape
the greuos and sharp punysshementes of god / with the which god thretneth
them, that will not show the wicked sinner his fautes, nor will not cry and
give warning, when they se the sword coming, that the sinner may be
converted from the wrong wey to the richt wey / and to the troth? I, AM
alive, says our lord, because that my flock is rauysshed / and my sheep
devoured of al beasts of the field / because they had no herdeman nor
ouerseer. For trewely the sheperdes soucht not for their flock, that, that was
weak and feeble they did not strength, that was sick / they did not heal,
that was broken / they did not bind to gether, and that, that was lost they
did not seek for it, BEHOLD says our lord, I shall ask a count of my
shepeherdes for the death of my flock / and I will cause them to cease and to
feade my flock no longer. And now euin as bisshops, for because of their
office and duty, oucht not to here or obey the popes co^mandmentes in those
things, that we have rehearsed before, euin so truly al other christian men /
be they never so mean or of low degree, as many as being touched by the holy
ghost, do ones plainly perceive, that they do keep such marriages, as be
incest: they may / yea and are bound for the love and religion that they owe
to god / not only to break streicht wey such marriages / but also with a stable
and steadfast stomac / and such as a christian man oucht to have / be bond to
with stand and resyste valiantly the Pope / all though he would threten them
by a.M. cursings and exco^munications, that they should do the contrary.

For there be two laws says pope Urban, one public / an other private. And
the public law is that, which has been confirmed by writynge of the holy
fathers. The private law is the law / that is written in men's hearts / by
the inspiration of the holy ghost / as thapostoll speaks of certain,
WHICH have the law of god written in their hearts. And in an other place he
says, WHEN the heathens / which have no law / do NATurally / that is to say
/ by the inspiration of the holy ghost only / without any law written / tho
things that the law commands, they be the law to them self. Therefore if
any of these, says Vrbane, has people in his governance under the bishop /
in his church, and does live secularly, and if that he, inspired with the
holy ghost, will save him self in some monasteri / or among regular chanons:
because this man is moved by the private law of his conscience / that is, by
the motion of the holy ghost, there is no reason, that he should be bond to
the public law. For the private law is of more dignity than the public
law. FOR doubtless the spirit of god is the law, and, THEY that be led by
the spirit of god, be led by the law of god / and, WHAT person is it /
that can of richt withstand the spirit or holy ghost? Therefore who so ever is
led with this spirit / let him go his ways free, even by our authority /
yea although his bishop say nay. FOR there is no law nor bond made for a
richtwyse and a good man / but where as is the spirit of god, there is
liberty and fredome / and, IF ye be led with the spirit of god, ye be not
under the law, that is to say / if we follow the motion of the holy spirit
and of our conscience / we be not under the commune law / which ever ouchte
to give place to the pryuate law. For in tho things / that be forbidden by the
law of god / we must obey our conscience: and in other things the church.
Now first the church can not bind any person to sin by her commandment.
Second, it can not be avoided / but that such persons, which by the law of
god and nature be unlawful to marie / and yet be coupled by marriage, or at the least / that is presumed to be marriage / do live in sin / only except that
they be married by ignorance, and that by such ignorance, as could not be
avoided. Finally Paul says, HE that puts difference between meat and
meat, if he eat / then he is condemned / by cause that / that he does is not
done with faith, and good conscience. For all that is not done with faith is
sin.

Of these.iij. reasons / it follows / that al christian men / if their private
conscience, lichtned with the holy ghost / and knowledge of holy scripture, as it
ought to be, has moved them unto it / they may without any ieopardie / yea and
are bond to make a divorce with her, whom both nature and the law of god
does forbid them to have to their wife: and to deliver them self from that
untrue and only presumed and prete^sed marriage: the common law / what so
ever it be / notwithstanding and co^mandynge the contrary. Likewise as a
secular priest / moved by his own conscience / and not by any lichtenes or
inconstancye may laufully go to an other bysshoppryke ageynste his own
Bysshoppes will, no manner of decree of the fathers to the contrary
withstanding: and as a regular professed, or the bishop of a church /
thouch his prelate and the pope be against it / may laufullye go to a streyter
manner of living the co^mun law notwithstanding and bidding the contrary. For
such a one, as Innocente said, after that he has asked license of his
prelate to go his way, upon his private law, which is to be preferred before
the commun law he is absoyled and losed, and may freely fulfill his purpose of
a more holier living / the saying nay and froward forbiddyng of his
indiscrete prelate not withstandinge. For who so ever abuses the power, that
is given him / deserves to lose his privilege. And even so it is in the
marriage / that if a man's conscience move him to divorce / that he divorce him
self, though the church say contrary. For truly al though the church does
not declare such manner of diuorsis, yet the church is bond of deute to
declare them, and to bid openly such diuorsis to be made. And all though the
Pope by his prepensed and express act, does not agree to this divorce / yet
for all that by his secret act and of duty he utterly agrees unto it. AND
HITHERTO we have showed well and sufficiently / by very many reasons, as far as
it perteyneth to this purpose / that the prohibition / THAT we should not mary
our brothers wife / which is dead without issue / is not such a prohibition,
as stondith by constitution of man / but as nature first did plant in man's
mind / and afterward chastity and reverent sham facidnesse has kept it
before the law: and our lord showed it unto his chosen people by Moses, and
such as the custom of christian men, with great consent and agreement of them
that uses it, has from the beginnynge of the christian faith many years
followed and observed / which has so often ben renewed by counsayles, received
and confyrmed by latter laws. And finally we have proved, that the Popes
authority can not stretche so far / that he may dyspense with such maryages /
whether they be made all redye, or be yet to be made. The which things /
most gentle reder / because we trust they will so satisfye and content the,
that we thiinke it but labor utterly lost to seek for aid any farther in
this matter / either of holy scripture / or of the decrees of the church, or
of the determinatio^s of the universities, that be in Italye, France, and
England, or of the suffragis and voycis of the greatteste learned men that be /
as yet there be a great many behind, it seems to us best here, to conclude
and make an end of our work, and not to tarry the any longer in rekenninge
them up. And this one thing / most indifferent reder / we beseech the for the
love that thou haste to god, to virtue and goodness / that as thou see the
consent and agreement of so many universities / the favor and studies of so
great learned men, to bend and enforce them self so lovingly and religiously,
only to maintain and defend the auctorytie of the law of god: that thou
again, both with thy lerninge and authority, will farther and set forward
their enterprises, wylles, and desires, by all meanis that thou canste /
remembrynge how fearful and grievous that punisshement is, which Christ
threatenith them withal, that usurp and wrongfully take upon them the key of
godly cnowlege and lerninge, and another they them self do enter in to it / and
yet do let and stop out other / which do all that they can to break in to it.
