AN ANSWER To certain seditious and Jesuitical Queres, Heretofore purposely and
maliciously cast out, to retard and hinder the English forces in their going
over into Ireland.

Whereby is fully proved that the British were the first, and most ancient
Proprietors and Inhabitants of that Land (which was at the first called Britain
the Less) before the accession of the Irish thither, and that the Irish came in
but by the sufferance of the British; Of what Country the Irish at the first
were; their often rebellions and defections; the subduing and reducing all of
them to obedience, as well long before the Conquest of England, by William the
Norman, as since; together also with the names of the new Kings, which the
Irish have lately elected and made amongst themselves, with many other
necessary discoveries of great concernment, fully manifesting the English
interest to that Land, and the miserable sufferings of the English there, in
all ages, by the barbarous and bloody actions of the Irish.

LONDON, Printed by WILLIAM Du-GARD, Printer

To the Right Honorable The Lord PRESIDENT, and COUNCIL of STATE.
Right Honorable!
It Is not my ability, but the force of the Cause, and necessity of this task
(others of better parts being silent) that prompt me to challenge an interest
in your honor's patronage of my weak endeavors in asserting the English
interest in Ireland, against a more dangerous then known stickler for the
Irish, and their gangrened Cause, discovering himself in some pernicious Queres,
cunningly dispersed at such a season, wherein they might have a full influence
upon the common genius of the Army, then designed for Ireland: And finding
light sufficient in my self from such experimental truths, as lodge in my own
bosom, to discover the Querist's Prestigies; I have adventured a little to draw
the curtain, and make way for some more fit and able, to vindicate the just
interest of England, against their causless and implacable enemies, the
barbarous Irish Rebels. This piece being only intended as an incitement
thereunto. And such it will surely prove, if it find your honor's favorable
aspect, and the like approbation from those other wise steers-men, whom the
Lord has placed at the helm of this Nation's Government: And for those
adherents to the Irish, whose minds are fore-stalled, and carried away with
the stream of their falls asseverations, and lose the reputation of their
modesty in the Irish impudency, (although I wish they may be in their
Judgments rectified, and manners reformed,) yet I value not their carpings nor
vain exceptions; Quia Momus nunquam gnarus est. I only beg your honor's
acceptance of these lines from my poor hand, so as my joies may be continued
in the memory of your good Acts; my affection owe's a duty to the performance
of this work, which will at last toll in better Ringers, prostrateing my
endeavors at the feet of your honors, as those of a sublime understanding.

I am Your Honor's most humble and engaged Servant THO. WARING.

TO HIS EXCELLENCY Oliver Cromwell, Lord GENERAL of the Armies of England,
Scotland, and Ireland.
And also to the Right Honorable HENRY IRETON, Lord Deputy of IRELAND.
THe present seed of the ancient Scythians, and other barbarous Easterlings
(the now Irish, assisted with some collapsed and degenerate English Papists,
striking at the very root of the tree of Protestanism, do not content
themselves with their barbarous torturing, and murdering of vast numbers of our
Religion, and blood, every days fiery malice (as I may say) producing a new
way of the most exsecrable and amarulent tortures of those most innocent
people in coolness of blood, wherein they glutted themselves. But of late,
finding the sword of God drawn out, and prosecuted by your Excellency, and
seeing the noble English spirits impatient, until God by his and their swords
should avenge their brethren's bloods by the destruction of that inhumane
generation; Some of them, as far as possible, to take off the resolute
intentions of the Protestant souldierie from retaliating upon the Irish such
destruction, as they had generally vowed to exercise upon us all, have cast out
certain cavelling and seditious Queres; whereby they would amaze and blind some
inadvertent men, excuse or at least extenuate their own high offenses, make the
English interest to Ireland seem dubious, and themselves to be the ancient
proprietors of that Land, thereby also, with a sublime disdain, inveighing
against Conquerors and Conquests, (the greatest persons and most common
interests of all the whole world) which is a boldness without parallel.

Now, others of better talent, and more versed in the antiquities of Ireland,
sparing their pens, I have taken up the boldness (out of small ability) to
contrive the following Answers to those Queres, by which, if any (formerly
seduced by the vain pretenses of the Irish) be untwined from them, and brought
within the sight of the truth, I have my desires. And as your excellencie's
valor against these Monsters of men, has by God's assistance quelled their
furies, and your wisdom infatuated their Counsels: so I doubt not, but the eye
of your Judgment has discerned their bloody and subtle intentions, in part
declared by their actions: I am yet a stranger to your Excellencie's persons,
but not to your heroic, noble and pious deeds: My lines (though not
satisfactorie) I beseech you yet take in such worth, as when perused, you will
vouchsafe to call upon more able pens to perform that duty wherein
(unwillingly) I am yet deficient; the great God of truth so order all your
Councils, and Actions, that they maybee crowned with a glorious and your most
desired success, so praye's

Your Excellencie's most humble Servant THO. WARING.

THE PREFACE.
THere has bin lately published a certain seditious Pamphlet, entitled
Queres, propounded to the consideration of such as were intended for the
service of Ireland, which as it seems was brought in by one Gawre (of an Irish
name) and one, who as (I have been informed since) is a Jesuit of that
Country: This man in formalitie, smoothly pretends to righteousness, but in
realitie (discernable to the dullest apprehension) hatcheth and harbors
horrible, hellish and most bloody thoughts; and inflamed with a fiery malice,
thirsts after the destruction of the Protestant Religion, the exstirpation of
all the Religious English in that Land, both root and branch, together with
their interest there, and would by his subtle and numerous questions,
dishearten the conscientious noble English Spirits, from engaging that way
either in person or expense, to reduce that Island from mere barbarism and
Idolatry, to the true worship of God, and obedience to the Laws, established
by the ancient proprietors of that Nation (the English) and both anciently and
lately submitted unto by all Inhabitants of the same.

But if you mark this Querist, he persueth the sophistry and subtlety,
anciently practiced by the Jesuits; and so far as he would have all his
Questions believed and grounded upon undoubted truths, and to be admitted as
verities: And although these Queres (being so uncertainely and falsely grounded)
are worthy of no answer at all, having all along the plain marks of
insoliditie and sedition upon them: yet to satisfy the doubts of such
judicious and upright men, as only desire to know the truth, and com not with
a mind pre-occupate, and suborned by injurious principles.

I shall endeavor to lay open the Querist's errors and delirements, resolve the
Queres he makes, and discover the truth in the things he most harp's upon,
for his advantage; and because I conceiv the Jesuit's first Quere (though not in
plain words) yet implicitly, by insinuation, intend's principally Ireland and
the pretended interest of the Irish (as he in some of them after expresses)
And although also my short and weak wings are far deficient to soar so high a
pitch, as to cite all, or near the sum of all authentic Authors and Records,
manifesting the propriety, right, and interest of the Land of Ireland, to be
originally in the British, yet because those of the Nation of England (already
led away with the aerie, and vain pretenses of the Irish, and who never yet
scrutinized the English interest) may be undeceived, made sensible of their
former errors, possessed with the English right, be acquainted with the
iterated rebellions of the Irish in many ages, the often reducing, and
bringing them to subjection, by the British or English, and with other things
by these Queres made disputable, I shall freely contribute my Talent to this so
necessary work, and first set down the Queres in order, and then answer them
severally.

AN ANSWER TO THE Irish Queres.
The first Quere.
WHether the Land or inheritance that a Nation has for some hundreds or
thousands of years enjoyed, and possessed without any others laying claim to
have a more special right to the same, be not their special right which God
and nature has given them?

The first Answer.
IN this first Quere, the Querist desire's to have it inferred, and also
granted, that the Irish Inhabitants, as they now stand in opposition to
England, are an entire Nation, and that they were the first and sole
Proprietors of Ireland, as given unto them by God and nature, whereas in truth
they are a people composed partly of the old Britains, the first Inhabitants
thereof, partly of Scythians and Goths, sent thither out of Biscaie in Spain,
partly of Danes and other Easterlings, some sent in by the Kings of Britain, and
others intruding themselves, and principallly of English sent thither, by the
Kings of England in several ages, as in the ensuing discourse shall appear, so
as the fraud and fallacy of this first Quere being clearly laid open, strike's
far to the answering of all the rest.

And first to say something of the soil and Island, now called Ireland, which by
several ancient writers has been rendered by several other names, signifying
(for the most part) that it is a Western part of Britain, which the very name
now given unto it by the Irish, viz. Eirin, signifying a western Country, does
much demonstrate, and besides, at this day a part of Mounster in Ireland is
called Hiermoun, in English, West-Mounster, which show the name Eirin to be
derived from Hier, which is west, as appears plainly by Mr Cambden (a faithful
relater of the best antiquities extant:) the ancient Geographer writes in
these words, of Islands for greatness, the Indian Taprobane is prime and
principal, next after it, Britain, and in third degree, another British Island
called Hibernia, (that is Ireland) whereupon Ptolomie in his writings of
Geographie, call's it in plain words Britannia parva, the old Geographers
called it the Britains Island; Strabo called the Inhabitants Britains. Diodorus
Siculus termed Irin a part of Britain, and Aristotle in his book de mundo, Cap.
3. has these words as they stand translated, viz. Ibi sunt Insulae, quae
quantitate maximae habentur, numero vero duae sunt, Britanicae dicuntur, Albion
and Hibernia. By all which it falls clear that by the most ancient and
authentic writers, the Island of Ireland was ever taken and accounted a
British Island, only belonging to great Britain, neither is it found in any
approved Writer or Record, that ever any King or Potentate claimed right or
interest in the soil or Land of that Island, save only the Kings of great
Britain, in right of their Kingdom, now called England, which in several ages
they have not failed to do, by reducing and subduing the unjust rebellion, and
usurpation of those unrulie Inhabitants, and if you look into Monuments or
Records of later time, you shall never find it called a Kingdom or a Realm,
till in the reign of Henry the 8. when by Act of Parliament, it was made and
styled a Kingdom, and that King declared, and confessed King thereof,
unanimously agreed by all the Inhabitants of that Island. But that by all Acts
of Parliament in that Land, and other Records, it was always till then, for 400
years or thereabouts called the King's land of Ireland, and by several Acts of
Parliament, viz. one Act in the twenty eighth year of that King, Henry the 8
reign Cap. 2. That Land is declared to be appending and belonging to England;
And by another Act there made in that King's reign, the said Island is declared
to be a Member, appending and rightfully belonging to England, and united to
the same; and in several other Acts there the same in substance is asserted,
and ordained, and all this agreed and assented unto by the very Ancestors of
those now in Arms there against England, and the Governors thereof; and yet by
this Querist it is esteemed to be an Original, entire Nation, distinct from
any Conqueror, yea such, as he scruple's to have them called Rebels.

Thus having given you the opinion and report of the ancient and some modern
proofs of the denomination, and full relation of that Island to Great Britain,
it will be requisite, that by the like ancient and modern evidence the just
right and propriety of the English to that Land, and to the dominion thereof,
and to the natural subjection of all the Inhabitants thereof to England, be
also manifested and avowed, the better to let the world see the Querist's
fraud, and subtlety in this general vast Quere, and indeed throughout all the
rest of his abusive Queres and insinuations.

Mr Cambden, that faithful searcher into Antiquities, affirms that most of
the best approved and knowing Writers out of Antiquities, do determine that the
first known Inhabitants of Ireland, were Britains sent thither, by the Kings of
Great Britain, of which opinion he conclude's himself to be, but that they
could not send sufficient Inhabitants, to replenish such a Continent, and that
by a great mortality happening among them, they were much diminished; and you
may perceiv by a Statute made in Ireland, in the 11. year of Queen Elizabeth,
that Gormond (by some Writers called Gorgund) Son to Belin King of Great
Britain, was Lord of Biscaie in Spain, (as his posterity long after him
continued) and having occasion to com into Britain, his Father being dead he
voyaged into Denmak, and in his return a great multitude of his Subjects of
Biscaie met him at Sea, (being straightened for relief in their Country) and
humbly besought him to assign them some place for habitation, whereunto (by
advice of his Council, he assented, and directed them to his Island, now called
Ireland, which wanted people, and sent with them guides, to bring them thither,
where finding a fertile soil, they increased abundantly, bringing their
language with them, and being then the greater number of people, after the new
access, involved the British-tongue into theirs, (yet in some sort mixed) as may
appear by many new words and names of things, well understood by the Welsh. It
being of daily experience, that the Welsh do much more soon and easily learn
Irish then the English can do, and that much of the Irish is understood by them.

Giraldus Cambrensis called these Biscayners, Besclenses, and Cambden write's
very largely of their Ancestors coming into Spain, at the confluence of the
Northern Nations into those parts, alleging that part of them were Scythians,
and part Goths, and to add to the truth of this relation, their so coming
thither is specified in many of the rude, (yet ancient) Irish annals, both in
Irish and Latin.

The British Histories, and some of the English Chronicles do make mention of
Hiberus and Hermion, then Captains of those Besclenses, and their Bards (who to
this day keep, and at all feasts and public meetings, do chaunt and publish
the Pedidigrees and Acts of the Irish) do derive the most ancient Irish from
those that came out of Spain, rather choosing to glorify themselves in them,
then from the Britains, from whom so many of them are descended, and from whom
they had permission to dwell there: For, doubtless, there are many evident
demonstrations, that much of the East part of that Island, continued still
inhabited by Britains, and that those Besclenses, most inhabited the more
Western parts of Mounster, and Connaght, where their former neighbors and
friends might most easily eom to them, yet dispersed as they found cause; those
in the Western parts speaking more broad, do hardly understand much of the
language of the other: And to show further, that the Britains had a good share
in the Original ancestrie of the ancient Irish, the very Officers which the
Irish have from age to age used for their pedigrees, and Annals are to this
day called Bards, which were the same in office and denomination, employed by
the ancient Britains; And for their manner of holding Land, it was till the
first year of King James, by Gavelkind, as the ancient Britains held theirs,
though so corrupted in Ireland, as when the Laws came to be settled in the
beginning of King James his time, it was adjudged a barbarous and unreasonable
custom, and so abolished; Also their Irish Custom of Tainestrie, which they
called their Law, is derived from British, for, amongst them the word Taken, or
Thane signified an Elder, Governor, or Lord of a territory; And the same word
amongst the Irish had the same sense, and therefore the second person to the
Lord of the Country, who was to succeed (if a stronger force interposed not)
was called the Tanaist settled upon him, as Seniori and digniori, and he had
Lands and Impositions on the Country assigned to him in right of that Office;
The Lord also of the Country being put into Office by the same Law (where
force did not overbear it) all which, is now also abolished as unlawful. It
appears also by antiquity, that the Irish agreed with the Britains in the
custom of observing the time of Easter, both then, therein differing from the
Church of Rome.

The first known Inhabitants being thus sent into, and settled in Ireland by
the Britains, they so continued in subjection to the King of great Britain for
several ages, the contrary whereof has appeared in no memory; And to enter
into further Inquisition thereinto is not much material, no other King, Prince
or Potentate, having at any time made claim unto them, until the Romans
entered Britain, and held the same by conquest, after many and often
conflicts; In all which time, during their struggling against, and subjection to
the Romans, the British could not have that care and oversight of them, as
formerly they had, so as in that time they took head, and set up amongst them,
in a barbarous way, Rulers and petty Kings; which Rulers and Kings Giraldus
Cambrensis calls Tributaries, and what kind of Kings those then were, and
afterward continued to be, till King Henry the second's entry into Ireland,
may much appear in an ancient Manuscript, called the Book of Christ-Church in
Dublin, (then a priorie) lately a Cathedral Church; In which Manuscript are
these words concerning them, viz. Isti Reges non fuerunt ordinati solemnitate
alicujus ordinis nec unctionis Sacramento, nec jure hereditario, vel aliqua
proprietatis successione, sed vi and armis quilibet regnum suum obtinuit: In
all which time of the Roman's power in great Britain, neither the ancient
Britains in Ireland, nor those permitted new-com Besclenses, could extinguish
or alter the original right, which the Kings of great Britain undeniably had to
their dominion there, or to those Inhabitant's subjection.

It appears in Mr Cambden's and other Chronicles, and Histories, that during
the Roman's power in great Britain, the Norweyans and other Easterlings, by
way of piracie, and incursion infested those inhabitants of Ireland; and
though often beaten off, yet many got footing there, the Monuments of whom
remain to this day; and in after times when the Saxons warred in Britain, they
several times came over again, and so settled on many of the Seacoasts, as
they built of the walled Sea-Towns, excluding from amongst them the Irish, not
admitting them entrance, other then with great caution for Merchandise only;
And whereas the Querist would have it believed, that the Irish, as an entire
Nation, were originally impropriated in Ireland by God and nature, for many
hundreds, and some thousands of years, without any others laying claim to have
special right to the same, which (he seems to insinuate) did so continue to
these times; It does and will appear as well by what is formerly here remembered,
as what shall follow in this ensuing tract, that it is a ridiculous and
illusive surmise; for it must not be forgotten (especially appearing by good
History, that soon after the Roman's departure out of great Britain, the noble
Prince Arthur obtained that Land, who being a man of great action, as well at
home as abroad, passed into Ireland, and reduced those Inhabitants to their
ancient Subjection; In proof whereof, having some years after occasion for a
time to keep his Court at Carlion, in great Britain, he summoned the
Governors, and petty Kings of Ireland (of whom one, viz. Mr Gellomurroe, or Mr
Gillemurry is by name recorded, to appear before him at Carlion aforesaid)
there to do their homage to him; who thereupon came and performed the same
accordingly, which was don in the year after our Savior's nativitie, 579; and
this prove's a claim at least, made by the Kings of great Britain to the Island
of Ireland, as part of their dominions; Afterward, as is known to all men of
any reading, the Saxons and Angles out of Germany invaded great Britain, and
by many contests in Arms, and bloody Battles obtained the Dominion thereof,
dividing it into several Kingdoms amongst themselves, which continued for many
years; In all which times the Irish Inhabitants took more Liberty to root
themselves in their barbarous usurpation and tyranny: for we cannot find,
that then, before, or since they established any certain Government, either
regal or otherwise, neither are there extant any authentic memories, of any
certain or passable Laws ordained by them, for the regulating of any Christian
people; yet soon after, the Saxon's Heptarchie was reduced into an Entire
Monarchy; It is manifest by good History and Record, that Edgar King of great
Britain (then and now called England) not unmindful of that Kingdom's ancient
right and interest in Ireland, labored, and obtained another reducement, and
had the possession of most of that continent, as appears by the Books of that
excellent writer Judge Cook, extracted out of Records of the Tower; Afterward,
when the Danes obtained the Rule and power in great Britain, they so little
forgot the ancient and just challenge to Ireland, as that they sent thither
good numbers of men who gained large footing in several places of the best
parts of the Island, of whom there yet remain many visible Monuments, as their
intrenchments, and Fortifications to this day, called Danes Mounts, or Rathes,
in Irish Lisses, and round slender high Towers, yet called Danes Steeples, or
Danes Towers, yea, the best and largest Suburbs about Dublin is yet called
Ostmantown, which term the Saxons gave to the Danes as Easterlings, and
doubtless, it is their then access, and some former incursions made by them as
aforesaid, which left many of them there fixed, who were the ancestors to the
now pretended original Nation, as pretended to be given to them by God and
Nature; Afterward, the Norman William, the Conqueror, became possessed of the
Dominions of England, it is universally known what business he had, as well to
settle that so gained Land, as to content his Allies, and parties brought with
him, and to preserv what he left behind him in France, to which retrospect he
was enforced by many disturbances and attempts; neither is it unknown, how
unwarrantably his three next successors came to the Crown in England, and
against what counterworkings, and heart-burnings, they held Regencie there,
besides their distractions in their affairs, and from their neighbors of
France, being not free from encumbrances of Scots, and Welsh, whereby all
judicious men may conclude, that none of them could safely embrace the
restitution of Ireland, howsoever it concerned them. But as soon as one lineal
descent had settled the Crown of England upon King Henry the second, who was
great Granchilde of the said William, the Norman; and who is recorded to be
the most powerful English Monarch, both in England, and France, since the
Normans coming in; That King applied to the Pope for his consent, to regain his
said Land of Ireland, who consenting thereunto, to the end it might be brought
into orderly Government, as well Ecclesiastical as Civil, He yet suspended all
action thither for some years, being interrupted by his affairs in France, and
the disobedient combinations of his sons; But after, an occasion happening by the
invocation of one of the Irish petty Kings, he permitted many of his
Subjects of England and Wales to pass thither, who by their valor, possessed
themselves of a good part of that Island; Then in the year 1172 did that King
with a competent Army repair thither in person, and resumed into his hands his
ancient right of Dominion and interest there, without much bloodshed, and was
therein confirmed by the absolute and free submissions of all the petty Kings,
and other Rulers, as well Ecclesiastical as Temporal, and by all others then of
any value there, which they delivered unto him under their Seals; There did
he also receiv the Homage, Fealty, Allegiance, and subjection of all those
petty usurping Princes, and others as his Liege Subjects; There did he hold a
great Council, or general Assmblie of all the Prime inhabitants of that Island,
at Lismore, which they called a Parliament, and gave them the English Laws. Vbi
Leges Angliae ab omnibus sunt gratanter receptae and juratoria cautioone
praestita, confirmatae. There did he send his Mandats to the Archbishops,
Bishops and Clergy of Ireland, to assemble in a Synod at Cashel, wherein
Cbristianus Bishop of Lismore was President, in which Synod that King's
entrance, actions and atchievments there were declared to be lawful; and it
was there also concluded, that it was most meet, that as Ireland by God's
appointment had recovered a lawful Lord and King from England; so also they
should from thence receiv a better from of living; they also then established
that all Divine Offices of holy Church, should from thenceforth be handled in
all parts of Ireland, according as the Church of England did observe them: In
that Synod also, they made diverse other Canons, concerning the
Church Government there, which Acts were ratified by the Regal Authority of the
same Henry the second: To the same purposes, another general Synod was soon
after held at Armagh in Vlster, where the same things, and others for right
ordering of that Government were resolved and agreed upon: There was also
placed Hugh Lacie Justice of Ireland for the Government of that Land, wherein
that Land then seemed to be formally settled in a peaceable subject condition
to England, as it ought to be. Thus may the Querist, and all others see that
that Land, and supposed original Nation did not continue many hundreds or
thousands of years, nor was enjoied till these times, without any others
laying claim to have right to the same. It may be demanded (though standing
thus) how might King Henry the second seiz all that Land into his own hands,
and grant it to adventurers (as after he did) To this the answer is easy;
For, in a short time after, that King and the greatest part of his Army
withdrew into England; Then did all those petty Kings, Rulers, and men of
value, and the other Inhabitants falsely and traitorously join in a Confederacy
and action to extirpate, and expuls all the English and Welsh, then left there,
and did cast aside their duty and obedience to England, and the good order and
Laws, so freely and lately entertained by them, breaking all Faith and
Allegiance to him, to whom they had formerly sworn it; they murdered as many
as they could take at advantage, and at last besieged Dublin, and other Towns,
intending to destroy all the English; But the valor of those men left there,
and the vigilance of that King to reliev them did stoutly beat them off, and
frustrated their unchristian intention. Then that King finding them so embarked
in their former rudeness, and barbarism, as there was no faith or duty to be
exspected from them, and that they could not sit down in any civil society,
He, by advice of his Council confiscated all their Estates, and adjudged and
declared the Irish generally to be enemies and aliens, (in which condition
they continued long after) as is manifest by the Records, and Statute-Laws of
those times,) And then he set his Subjects of England and Wales at full
Liberty, to win what they could in that Land, toward the reducement thereof,
to his just Subjection: for better accomplishment whereof, he made chois of
ten special persons of quality and power in his other Dominions, to whom, by
grant of inheritance, he divided the Lands of that whole Island, who drawing
together their several Alies, friends, and other adventurers; they by that
King's countenance and assistance so bestirred themselves, as within few years
they became Masters, and possessors of the whole Island, and so continued
quietly, possessed for almost one hundred years, without any offense to
England, forcing the perfidious Irish (who were then few in number, after many
conflicts with them) into Mountains, Bogs, and boggie woods, there to wander up
and down, with the remain of their Cattle, not daring to be seen, or to graze
in any of the more habitable parts, where the English had footing; special
Statute-Laws prohibiting the same; Laws also were made, that upon pain of
fellonie, no Merchant, or, other liege person should trade with the Irish in
market, or otherwise; It was also made fellonie to succor any of the Irish
enemies; from the time of the foresaid division forward, was that Island only
called the King's Land of Ireland, till the reign of King Henry the eighth, as
appears by Acts of Parliament, and all Records mentioning the same; The
division he made was as follows, viz. To Richard Earl of Pembroke, of
Strigil, called Strongbow, he regranted the Kingdom, or Territories of Leimster
(surrendered to him by the said Earl Richard, whose it was pretended to be, in
right of his wife, sole daughter and heir of the last nominal, or tributarie
King thereof, except Dublin, and some lands thereunto lying, part whereof is yet
called the King's Land; and being divided into Manors, the Freeholders pay
chief rents into the Exchequer to this day, and except some maritim Towns,
Castles, and some lands about them which he reserved to himself; To Bobert
Fitz-Stephens and Miles Cogan, he granted the Territories called the Kingdom
of Cork, the City of Cork, and some lands thereunto lying reserved, as
aforesaid excepted (the heir of Cogan is yet possessor of some of those lands)
To Phillip le Bruce, the Territories called the Kingdom of Limerick, with
donation of Bishoprics, and Abbeies, except the City of Limerick, and a
Cantred of Land adjoining, reserved as aforesaid; To Sr Hugh de Lacie Justice,
or (as some write) Custos of Ireland, the territories called the Kingdom of
Mead, then of far greater extent, then the name Mead now import's; To Sr John
de Coursie all Vlster, which being a large continent, was quietly possessed by
him, and his English tenements many years; After his death (without heirs) it
was granted to Hugh Lacie, who held it, till forfeited; then was it granted by
King Edward the first, to Walter de Burgo from whom it descended to William de
Burgo; And after those Lands and Signories were by Edward the fourth adjoined
to the Demesne, and Crown Lands of England.

To William Fitz-Adelme de Burgo all Connaght, except a small part for life
given to Rotherick, formerly nominal King thereof, after whose death that Land
also was by King Henry the third, granted to Richard de Burgo, heir to
William, except the Cantreds of Roscomon, Randon, and two or three other
Cantreds near Athlon; All which were after granted by succeeding Kings to other
English, only Roscomon remained in the Crown, till Queen Elizabeth granted the
same to one Mr Malby; This whole Country came after to the Crown, by the
marriage of Lionel Duke of Clarence, son to King Edward the third, with the
Daughter and heir of de Burgo; To Sr Thomas Clare of the stock of the Earl of
Gloucester, all Ghomond, now the County of Clare which was confirmed to the
same Family, by grant from King Edward the first, to Robert le Poer, all the
County of Waterford (except the City and cantred about it) the chief of the
Family, of which Poers is now a Baron; to Otho de Grandison all Tipperarie.

Afterward King John having intelligence, that the English began to be at
variance amongst themselves, by reason that the Laws were not so spread, and
administered as they should be, made a voyage in person thither, with a
competent force for his honor and safety, and then did he divide the whole
Land into Counties, as they for the most part stand at this day, though
Connaght and Vlster since are much subdivided, he carried over with him diverse
learned men for civil and ecclesiastical Notion, he ordered and established
the Courts of Justice, as in England, viz. the Chancerie, the Kings Bench,
Common Pleas, and Exchequer, and other Ecclesiastical Judicatures, and settled
competent Judges in them; he appointed Justices Itinerant, and all other
Officers for Law and execution of Justice; and four terms in the year to be
kept as in England, by which the people became subject to Law (the Irish being
still held as enemies and Aliens) were better governed, lived in peace and
great prosperity many years, save what ruptures it endured by their own
dissentions, as hereafter appears. So as by what is above specified, it
appears the English were made lawfully inheritable, and became possessed of
the whole continent, wheresoever they could find places any way fit for
habitation; And to prove their possessions as well as their grants, besides
that in all the ancient Records, taking cognizance of all the habitable parts
of that Land, in which those English are named, you shall find no Juries upon
Inquiries, or trial of any causes whatsoever, Capital, Criminal, or common,
where is mentioned any Irish name, but all English: All their Officers and
Ministers of Justice being the same, and beside several Statute-Laws do assert
their universal possession. It is undeniably evident, that generally all the
now Freeholders of several great continents in that Island are English, either
descendents, or deriving from those first adventurers, or by ancient grants
from the Crown upon their forfeitures, though the truth is, many of their
laborers, underfarmers and tennants, which they call Churls, are and still were
Irish, the territories and Countries which those English, and some of late
settlement did, and do possess, are, viz. in the County of Down, the Countries
of little Ards, the Duffrey, Lecale, Mourn, the Newrie, and several other
places of lesser note; all the County of Lowth, the whole County of Dublin,
the entire County of Mead; the best and greatest part of the County of
Westmeath, all the County of Kildare, the greatest and best part of the
County of Catberlagh, part of the County of Wickloe, the greatest and best
part of the County of Wexford, all the County of Waterford, the greatest and
best part of the great County of Cork, the greatest and best part of the
County of Limerick, a great part of the County of Kerrie, the better half of
the County of Tipperary, all the County of Kilkennie, all the County of
Galwaie, a good part of the County of Roscomon, the most part of the County
of May, besides the large territories of Leix and Ophalie, in the Queen's
County, and King's County, planted in Queen Mary's, and the beginning of
Queen Elizabeth's Reigns, upon the Rebellion of the Mores, and Conners, the
surnames of these old English, so many (as of many hundreds more can here be
remembered) are annexed toward the end of this Answer to the first Quere. Of
these sirnames many are spread into very numerous Families, and persons, of
which many are advanced to degrees of Honor, and very many possessed of
great estates; and further to prove that those English were so possessed of all
those Lands, King Henry the second, and some other succeeding Kings granted
unto many of those Adventurers County Palatines, and unto many other very
large Franchises and immunities, for the better ordering of the Colonies: those
Adventurers divided the Lands generally into Manors, particular Freeholds, and
other English holdings; which (for the most part) do so continue to this day;
they granted all those Lands for easy rents and services to their Comilitants,
except some small parts which they kept in their own hands, who, or others
deriving from them, do still hold the same, pro part conquestus, as generally
appears in their ancient evidences.

Yet further, to prove the English great and general possessions there; it is
an apparent and unquestionable truth, that the English and strangers only did
build all the Castles, and stone-buildings, which then, and for some hundreds of
years after, were to be seen in any part of that Island, neither had the
Irish any stone buildings of their own erecting, till about the reign of King
Henry the eighth, when some of them gained estates from the Crown, howbeit it
is related in History, that the English built Castles from Sea to Sea, being
enjoined thereto by Law, beside what was don by Kings, great Lords, and other
principal adventurers.

It is further true, that all the Cities, Towns, and Corporations throughout
that Land, are entirely English, and only and originally endowed with
Charters, Franchises and Lands by the English; And howsoever some of the Maritim
towns were at first planted (as is traditioned from the Ancients) by Owstmen or
Easterlings, who fully submitted to the English Law, (not suffering any Irish
to dwell amongst them) yet those first Inhabitants were after either so
retracted or so worn out, as the Inhabitants became wholly English, as they
undoubtedly remained till the reign of Henry the eighth, and are for the most
part hitherto the same, where they have not in some parts of Ireland been
ruined, and corrupted by Irish Rebellions and insurrections.

It is true likewise, that all the bridges and passages were built and made
only by the English of old, and of late by the English authority; And also
that all Monasteries, Religious Houses, and Churches of any good structure
were founded, built and endowed by the English, only some few despicable Cells of
Monks there were, and some few poor Chapels despised, specially in some poor
Islands thereof.

These being evident demonstrations of the universal possession of the English
in that Island, it is further verified by some of their Laws in that Land
wherein mention is made of beautiful Cities and Towns, planted by the English
in that Island, but destroyed by Irish Commotions and garboils.

And more particularly by the Statute of Absentees in tempore Henry 8 and
other Statutes, wherein are expressions declaring the tranquillity and good
order of the English in that Land, that the English long defended it in due
subjection, against the Irish enemies.

It is also much to be observed, that it is not to be seen, before the time of
King Henry the 8 That the Irish had either Charter, evidence or authentic
writings for any Lands or possessions, neither could they have Interest, they
being no other till then, but enemies and Aliens, neither had they distinctions
or degrees of honor or Gentry, neither Armenor other Enfigns or Officers of
honors or gentry, as Duke, Marquess, Earl, Viscount, Baron, Knight of any
Order, Esquire, or Gentleman, till the English introduced them, neither had
they Governors of any legal or orderly form, or Judges or Officers of any
certain Law or judicial course, neither had they Migistrates of any Cities,
Buroughs or other Corporations or Courts of Justice Ecclesiastical or Civil,
or seals either of Justice or honor, or other species of civil or certain
Reglement.

And to give you these truths, of the ancient and modern right and possession
of the Britains and English in and to Ireland, (somewhat further ratified in all
the parts of interest in jurisdiction, and dependence) it appears by good
antiquities that long before the entrance of William, the Norman, into England,
the Archbishops of Canterbury had primacie over all Ireland, and that the
Bishops of Ireland, according to the ancient usage and custom, (as is written)
received their consecrations from the Metropolitan of England, it being
declared in the time of the said King William and his Son, that Canterbury was
the Mother Church of England, Scotland and Ireland, and other Islands adjacent,
(there being no Archbishops in Ireland, till about the year 1152. In
justification of what is before premised, it is recorded, that Gotherick one of
the petty Kings in Ireland, did write to Lanfrank Archbishop of Canterbury,
for consecration to be granted, to Patrick, nominated for a Bishopric: Also
that the said Archbishop Lanfrank, out of his authority there, did write to
Thurdelnack, another petty King there, wherein he laie's to their charge, That
the Irish men at their pleasure did forsake their wedded wives without
canonical cause, and match with any others, even such as were near a kin to
themselves or their abandoned wives, and that if another man with like
wickedness, cast off a Wife, her also rashly, and hand over head, they joined
withal by laws of marriage, or rather fornication, an abuse worthy to be
punished.

Also that Murchertagh another petty King of Ireland, and the Citizens of
Waterford addressed to Anselmus Archbishop of Canterbury, Anno Dom. 1095. for
erecting and ordaining at Waterford a Bishop, where no Bishop had been, and for
consecrating a Bishop there, whose name was Malchus, he also wrote for
consecrating another to be Bishop of Dublin, much about the same time; also
that the Citizens of Dublin sent Gregory (chosen to be Bishop there) unto
Ralph Archbishop of Canterbury, suing to him in these words, viz.
Antecessorum vestrorum magisterio, etc. that is, Unto the Mastership or chief
rule of your Ancestors, we willingly submitted our Prelates, from which (we
remember) that our Prelates have received their ecclesiastical dignities, etc.
All which, and other applications of like nature, do clearly evince the
submission of the Irish Clergy, to the rule and superintendencie of the
Archbishop of Canterbury, their then acknowledged Metropolitan.

And to proceed yet a little further, to prove the ancient English Title to
Ireland: In the Statute of the 11. Reginae Elizabethae, for granting lands in
Vlster to that Queen, her heirs and Successors; It is declared, That the Crown
of England had ancient and authentic Titles to the State and possession of the
Land of Ireland, conveied far beyond the lineage of the Irish. Also By a
Statute tempore Philippi and Mariae, for vesting the two large Territories of
Leix and Ophalie in the Crown: It is there again declared, That the Crown of
England had good right thereunto before, and that the Irish had entered into
those lands by force, and wrongfully usurped the possession thereof, Which
Statutes were enacted by the immediate Ancestors of that supposed Nation now in
Rebellion; the one made under a Popish Prince, the other under a Protestant,
Other Statutes and Records make like mention of the ancient right of England,
to the Land of Ireland; and where there is mention above made of about one
hundred years quiet possession of the English over all that Island, in the time
of Henry the second, and after, it may be demanded how afterward those
despicable Irish so gained upon the English, as in sometimes they did, and how
they obtained such large possessions, as in later times they had: A clear and
obvious Answer to all that well know Ireland may be given, That those English
Lords Adventurers, having jura Regalia, and other great privileges, and
authorities within their Counties Palatine (being eight in number at one time)
and therein power to pardon, make Chancellors, Barons and Knights, to make
Judges, Sheriffs, and all Officers within themselves (the Kings having few
Sheriffs any where, except in the Crosses or Tipperarie in Mounster, neither
was there much Law executed by the Kings immediate Authority) those Lords
received great yeerlie revenues, and some of them often advanced to the
government of that Land, by the King's favor, the Colonies under them being
rich, and spread all over the Land. Those Lords being com to the height of
prosperity, and not able wisely to manage and apply to their own good, those
great powers, endowments, and Graces of their Kings, fell into jealousies and
emulations one against another, whereupon ensued sharp and bloody contentions,
they having power to make peace and war at pleasure, without the licens or
authority of their chief Governors (which power was afterward taken away by
several statutes) they entered into sundry violences one against another, and
combined Parties against Parties; to maintain which, they called in to their
Assistance, their known enemies, the Irish, (then grown up into some numbers)
and so far were they transported with their blind envious surie that they put
Arms into the hands of the Irish and conducted them to their battails as hired
Soldiers: they assumed power to lay Taxes, Cesses, and Impositions upon their
English Colonies, Tenants, and Dependants, and by that means supported both
their English and Irish Soldiers, to the oppression of the other English, but
Lords countenancing and strengthening of the Irish, besides training them in
Martial actions. These dissentions and animosities began in the reign of King
John, as is before touched, but they rose not to much virulence, till toward
the end of the reign of King Henry the third, and so continued by fits in the
reign of King Edward the first, as that King's greater actions in France,
Scotland and Wales averted him from the more special care of that
Commonwealth; they conflicted in this manner many times, one against another,
to the great consumption of their English Tenants, who served under them, as
the Lacies of Mead warred against Courcie of Vlster, the foresaid Lacies
after, against the Bourks of Vlster and Connaght, the foresaid Lacies against
the Marshals of Leimster, who held that Country in right of the daughter and
heir of the bovsaid Richard Earl of Pembroke of Stigil, married to Marshal: The
Garaldines of Mounster and Leimster against the Butlers, the Garaldines against
the Bourks, the Bourks, against the Verdons of Mead, and Lowth; the Bourks
against the Clares; the Briminghams against the Verdons and other English in
the Pale: The Garaldines, Butlers, and Briminghams against the Bourks and
Poers, and indeed all the English Progenies, by part-taking and private
Offenses given, and taken, were imbroiled in the same quarrels, the Irish
looking on, and siding wheresoever they thought best, striving by their cunning
and malicious insinuations, to enlarge and blow every spark of discord amongst
them into flames of hostility: Hereupon start up that destructive and wicked
custom of Coigne and Liverie, which was hors-meat, mans-meat, and money taken
by the Soldiers upon the Colonies, and English Inhabitants, which custom and
exaction, was afterward by some Statutes made Felony, and by other Satutes
made treason, one whereof has this expression, Viz. At the request and
supplication of the Commons of this Land of Ireland, etc. Whereas of long time
there has been used and exacted by the Lords and Gentlemen of this Land, many
and diverse damnable customs and usages, which have been called Coigne and
Liverie, that is, hors-meat and mans-meat, for finding their Hors-men and
Footmen, and over that four-pence a day for every of them, to be had and paid,
of the poot earth-tillers and tenants, inhabitants of the same Land, without
any thing doing, or paying for the same, besides mante Robberies, murders,
rapes, and other manifold extortions and oppressions by the said horsemen and
footmen, daily and nightly committed and don, which be the principal causes of
the desolation and destruction of the said Land, and has brought the same into
ruin and decaie, so as most part of the English Freeholders and tenants have
been departed thereof, some into the realm of England, and some into other
strange Lands; Whereupon the aforesaid Lords and Gentlemen have intruded into
the said Freeholders and tenants inheritances, and the same kept and occupied
as their own, and set under them in the same Lands the King's Irish enemies, to
the diminishing of holy Church-rights, the disherison of the King and his
obedient Subjects, and the utter ruin and desolation of the Land; For
Reformation whereof, be it enacted, etc. By this and many other like Laws, it
is apparent, how the Irish thrust themselves into great quantities of the
English Land, and afterward as in the sequel appears, made themselves owners
of them; Another way of their entrance was by frauduent force and incursion,
as when by these broils one Colonie had ruined another, the Irish (being in
favor with the English Lords by their deceitful service) seized upon the weaker
Colonie, and forced out the inhabitants, which the English Lords allowed of for
the time, receiving the Irish as tenants at will, (though they afterward
turned the Lord's themselves quite out) Because the Irish would seem to afford
far greater rents, then the old British Freeholder, and also yield for the time
more Subjection, and (basely) also they committed their goods, estates, wives,
and children, to the will of those Lords (as formerly, and afterward they did
to the Irish Chieftains) another way of their entrance was, that the English
Lords (now strangely degenerating, and taking liking to their licentious,
sordid, and barbarous course of living) made them many times their Officers in
their Countries, as Seneshals, Marshals, and other Officers, (because they would
slavishly obeie their wills, who by extortion and oppression, in short time
forced out the English tenants, and in after times held the land as their own,
against the very Lords.

The widest Inlet they found, was about the tenth year of King Edward the
second, when Edward Bruice brother to the King of Scots entered into Vlster
with a power of Scots, (storied to be six thousand) and there committed great
slaughter of the English, both men, women and children; These gave one
overthrew to Richard de Burgo, or Bourk, and at another time took William de
Burgo brother to Richard, prisoner; they ruined Towns, Castles, houses and
Churches, wheresoever they came, and upon these events, the Irish there (who
formerly durst little show themselves, living in the least habitable parts by
sufferance of the English) rose and joined with the Scots, making all the
destruction they could of the English; with this addition Edward Bruice
proceeded further, through the parts of Leimster (the Irish from all parts
gathering to him) and from thence marched into Mounster, as far as Cashel, then
did the Irish lift up their heads on all sides, following the train of Bruice,
spoiling and destroying the English as far as they could; then the said Bruice
finding that the English began to assemble in some numbers against him, retired
into the lower parts of Mead (now Westmeath) and to the borders of Vlster,
making it his Master-work to secure that Province within his own power, (though
he often made roads into other parts) which is the first cause and ground why
Vlster became so destitute of English, and grew wholly Irish, beyond any other
of the Provinces; the Irish being as zealous as he to rid themselves solely of
the English: In this posture he continued about three years in Ireland, and
caused himself to be proclaimed King by the Irish, and about the end of the
said three years, making an expedition to invade the English of the Pale, he
was in the County of Lowth encountered by Brimingham (after created Earl of
Lowth) and other good forces of the English, where the said Bruice, and many
of his Commanders were slain, and his Army totally defeated and rent; Some of
the Scots returned home, but many remained there who joined with the Irish; in
that time the said Bruice, and the Irish had much dispeopled, and forced most
of the English out of the Limits and Countries now called the Counties of
Donagal, Fermanagh, Cavan, Tirone, Londonderry, Monorghan and Ardmagh having
sealed their malice by much devastation also, within the Countries of Autrim
and Down, lying between the Sea on the East, and the great Lough called Lough
Eaugh, and the River of Baun in the West, hardly accessible by the Irish, yet
did William de Burgo hold up a face of power in Vlster by help of other
neighboring English, until about the seventh year of King Edward the third,
when he was amongst them murdered, leaving only an heir female, who after
married with Lionel Duke of Clarence, third son to King Edward the third, soon
after the death of the said William, Hugh o Neil taking upon him superiority
amongst the Irish (now grown strong through the actions of Bruice, and the
decaie of the English) adventured to break over the Ban, and made great havoc
in the Colonies of the Rowt Clandebois, Ardes, and others within that circuit,
who in truth, never in any degree of their former being recovered themselves
after; and thus you see in a manner the full ruin of the English in Vlster.
Another enlargement gained by the Irish, upon English men's Lands, was soon
after the departure of Bruice out of Mounster, when Morris Fitz-Thomas
Garaldine of Desmond, having taken into his alliance and service many of the
Irish, made eruption into the Counties of Kerry, Limerick, Cork, and part of
Waterford, and in short time destroyed and banished great parts of those
Colonies, and there placed his followers (more Irish then English) and forced
most of the rest to join, or submit to his will; Soon after did the Irish upon
the Shanon side advance themselves, and settled in the large Country of Ormond
in Tipperary, then entirely the inheritance of the Earl of Ormond (by
acquisition of his ancestors) whereof some small parts were after recovered by
the succeeding Earls of Ormond, which now they hold, the rest remained with the
Irish, paying some small acknowledgment by composition.

The Irish also then entered into several other Wood-land Countries in
Tipperary, whence terrifying and forcing out the English, they seated themselves
there. About the end of the reign of King Edward the second (in the absence of
the English Lords of Leimster, Donald Mr Art Covenagh a bastard branch of
Dermot ne Gall, late reputed King of Leimster (so called in the Welsh, and
other Irish of those parts) brake out, and imbroiled those Clonies, renting
from them great parts of the Wood lands and mountainous Countries, soon after
Lisagh Moor, and one of the Conners in the heart of Leimster, discovered
themselves in open enmity; The said Lisagh (taking eight Castles in one evening
by surprise) defaced the Castle of Donamase, the Earl of March his chief house
in Leix, and upon the ruining of the English in those Countries, the one called
himself o Moor, Lord of Leix, and the other o Conner, Lord of Ophalie.

After the death of the said William de Burgo, above mentioned, certain of the
most active men of the Irish in Connaght, joining with some degenerate branches
of the Bourks (who had formerly assisted in the destroying, and rooting out of
the English, in the Southern parts of Vlster, next unto Connaght) entered into
all the goodly possessions of the said William, in Connaght, expelled the
English, and made themselves Masters of all; One of the said Bourks seating
himself in the County of Galway (of whom is descended the Earl of Clanrickard,
another fastened himself in the County of Mayo; and both took upon them Irish
Captain-ships; the one by the name Mr William Eighter, and the other by the
name of Mr William Oughter, retaining with them many of the Irish to inhabit
the Land, and fully finish the extirpation of the English Freeholders, the rest
of the Irish Partisans fell into the more northern parts of Connaght, as the
Counties of Sligo and Leitrim, and also the Northern parts of the County of
Roscomon, who so fully accomplished the expulsion of the English, as in the
time of King Charles, an intention being to plant that Province) upon Inquiry
made into every particular man's holding, there could not be showed any
ancient Evidence for any Land holden amongst them, as in the other Provinces
of Mounster and Leimster, are to be showed in great numbers.

About the twenty fifth year of King Edward the third, was Richard de Clare
murdered by the men of Thomond, at what time, and after, the Irish so insulted
there, as the English were either in short time massacred, or forced into other
parts for their more safety:

And thus is plainly evidenced in brief, part of the means of the great
encroachments of the Irish upon the English possessions, especially in the
remote parts, and now were the English Lords, and such of the English
Freeholders as they could draw or force with them, arrived at a great height of
degeneration; Now had they for the most part betaken themselves to the Brehan or
Tanistree Law, as they called it, and other Irish usages and customs (so
destructive to themselves) and repudiated the English Laws brought with them,
under which they happily lived, and under which the people of England had, and
have so many ages flourished, and been famous through providence, except what
remained in the five shiers of the Pale, and in some small circuits about the
walled-Towns, which retained in some measure the English Laws: Now did they
generally embrace the Irish garb of licentiousnes and tyranny over the
inferiors; They erected amongst themselves Captain-ships in their Countries,
after the Irish fashion, and unwisely suffered the Irish to do the like, where
they had gotten footing, applauding them in all things, whereby the Irish were
raised into a kind of Dominion; they little obeyed or regarded the Governors
sent out of England (though for their only good, and many times to rescue
them from the Irish outrages and fury, and reconcile their own unnatural jars)
they suffered not the King's Writs to run in their Countries, but they would
undertake in a summarie way, to answer for their followers, as they now call
them, for what wrong or crime soever committed; they assumed Irish nicknames,
as the chief of the Burks, Mr William Brimingham, Mr Yoris Mangle, Mr Costelo
Dexeter, Mr Jorden Archdeacon, Mr Odo Condon, Mr Maiog, one of the Garaldines,
Mr Gibbon, and some hundreds the like in that Land, and this they did in
contempt of the English name and Nation; They went to the wars in Irish
furniture to their horses, and Irish arms defensive and offensive, shearing
their horses mains after the Irish manner: Insomuch, as afterward there was
necessity by Laws to enforce them to ride in saddles; the Irish riding only
on small quilted pillions, fastened only with a sursingle; they combined in
sull complacencie for course of life with the Irish in all things, even to
rebellious actions, several times, yea, so far were they sunck in this base
degeneration and defection, as the Earl of Desmond claimed privilege, never to
com to Parliament, or within walled Town, but at his own pleasure, (which
privilege he in Queen Elizabeth's time surrendered and renounced) And it was
resolved amongst them, that because they by violence and oppression had intruded
into the Lands of the inferior English, and given the Irish liberty to dwell
there first at will, (though it proved otherwise after) and finding the power
out of England slack to control them, by reason of other imploiments; They at
length judged it most preservative to incorporate with the Irish, and so cast
off the English Law and Loialtie, presuming thereby, the better to keep what
they had so ravished, knowing well, that if the English Law gained concurrencie
amongst them, the parties wronged, or their descendents removed as aforesaid,
would (doubtless) recover their own, and so shorten the great revenues and
cuttings, wherein they thought they had ascertained a complete interest, by
those ways of confusion; But it fell out otherwise in shor time, for by God's
just avengement on their wickedness, the Irish, (who many years lived in the
Island as aforesaid, by their sufferance, neither of force, nor any way
deterred by the English; daily increasing in numbers, actuated in Martial
Discipline, possessed also (though but at will, of great quantities of Land)
they, as opportunities offered, (part whereof is after herein expressed) rose
up against their Lords, especially in the Woodland Countries, and called the
Lands their own; and in short time became formidable to the English, who began
now to find their error, in so prodigiously forgetting themselves, their noble
ancestors and originals, and the glorious Kingdom from whence they came,
putting themselves, in a manner, into the hands of their slavish enemies, and
(as may be said) were transformed into another people: These disorders,
fractures, and insolences, and the great pressures and detriments of the
English crying loud into England, at last the noble and victorious Prince, King
Edward the third, pitying their deformed and lapsed condition, in the thirty
sixth year of his reign (though his foreign engagements were great and heavy
at that time) sent thither as his Lieutenant, Lionel Duke of Clarence his third
son above mentioned, with a competent strength, to reduce things to some better
form; this young Lord continued there (for the most part) seven years, brought
with him a good and honorable Council, both for peace and war, set himself
with all zeal and affection, specially to reorder the English Colonies, if it
might be, to reintegrate them in their pristin estates, freedom and government,
himself having good interest there as is above touched. To this Livetenant
many of the Irish made submissions, as they had many times don before to King
Henry the second, King John, and after to King Richard the second, and others,
authorized by the Kings of England, he had sundry conflicts with the Irish,
very many of the English (after a short time) siding with him.

About the 40 year of King Edward the third, he held that famous Parliament at
Kilkenny, wherein plainly appears (by the Laws made there, and some others
formerly enacted by Rockesby, Justice of Ireland 25 E. 3) the great
degeneration and deformity of the old English above specified (Laws and
Statutes being the best Dictates of the maladies of times) and that the
principal labor was to reform, and bring into temper and rule of Law, the old
English Colonies, Some particulars of which Laws were, viz. Against Parlies with
the Irish without leave; That Chieftains should assist and apprehend Felons;
Against barbarous Fees and extortions of the Lord's Officers called Marshals;
Against the English calling the Irish to help them in their quarrels; Against
the Lords distreining contrary to the English Law; That the English should
only use the English Law, and not the custom called the Brehan Law, or Marcheor
Law.

That if any of the English race, should use an Irish name, Irish language,
Irish apparel, or any other guise or fashion of the Irish, his Lands should
be seized till he conformed, Or (if he no Land) then other mulcts were
appointed; That the Lords should not disturb the King's Officers in executing
their Offices; That Sergeants Bailiffs should execute the commands of the King
and of the Sheriffs, that the Sheriffs and Sergeants of Franchises, should give
acquittances for the Kings money received of Debtors, and receiv and pay by
Indenture: That no Sheriffs should hold Courts contrary to the Common Law;
That the English should not marry, nor Gossip with the Irish; That the English
should use the English language and nurture; That old and new English should
all alike be called Lieges of the King; That no English should use Irish or
barbarous sports; that no Irish Pipers, Rimers, bablers, Skelaghs, Ferdanes,
Carraghs or news-tellers, should be suffered to com amongst the English: That
no Kearns, Hoblers, nor idle men should range, take meat, etc, of the people
against their wills, but hue and cry to be made after them.

That no Irish should be admitted to benefits, or entered into religious houses:
That Judges should travel half yearly to enquire of offenses, and to execute
the Law: That four Justices of peace, of and in each County should charge the
Inhabitants with horse and foot to defend themselves against Irish enemies. That
robberies committed in the guildable, should not be protected in the
franchises, and so on the contrary, but the thieves to be delivered up to the
proper officers; and many other like Laws, were then made toward restoration,
and recomposing of the then deformed and adulterated English; and for the
further redress, diverse other Laws (some before, and some after) were made, viz.
One to take away protections, which with frequent pardons were observed to be
pestilent Remora's to the English restitution and secure peace, insomuch as
King Edward the third, toward the later end of his reign, sent two Ordinances
into Ireland, viz.

First, Justitiarius Hiberniae non concedat pardonationes de morte hominis, nec
de roberiis, seu incendiis, et quod de caetero certificet dominum Regem de
nominibus petentium.

Secondly, Item quod nec Justitiarius, nec aliquis magnas Hiberniae, concedat
protectiones alicui contra pacem regis existentis. And the experience of the
common damage by such pardons, and protections ever since, prove's the
malignancie of them, that being charged by diverse good authors (conversant in
Irish affairs) to be the dishonor and ruin of the Commonwealth: Other Laws
were also made, viz. One to distinguish betwixt the English and Irish, by the
cutting off their beards: Another, against the taking of amends for the murder
of a friend: Another That no man should stir up the Irish to assist in their
war: Another, Against taking Thieves into Comerick (in English) protection:
All which Laws at Kilkenny were after confirmed, and revived by another Law
made in the tenth year of King Henry the seventh Chap. 8, Wherein are these
words, viz. As long as those Laws were put in ure and execution, this Land
continued in prosperity and honor, and since they were not executed, the
people rebelled and digressed from their obedience, and the Land fell to ruin
and desolation, etc. And the truth is, it appears by good Histories of those
times, and more authentically by Records, both of the Exchequer and
Common Pleas of those years, that by practice of these Laws, and the industry
and travel of the said Lionel, notable alteration was made, in the manners of
the people, and much don of value toward the restitution of the English
Government, in the English Colonies; That the Crown-Revenues, both certain and
casual, were duly accounted for in all the Provinces, and that the King's Writ
did run, and the Common Law executed in all parts amongst the English.

This Duke built the walls of Catherlagh, he also reduced much lands in
Connaght and Vlster, into the English men's hands, and this good order continued
all the residue of that King's reign, and part of the reign of King Richard the
second, but toward the middle of his time, the Irish and some far degenerate
English, hearing of the Duke of Clarence his death in Italy, and finding great
dissentions to arise in England, combined themselves to the fresh annoiance of
the English, and prosecuting their long intendment to exstirpate them: And now
did the English find cause to raise themselves into defens against the Irish,
which they were afterward dangerously put unto: thereupon that King having
received repuls in his affectation to be Emperor, and desirous to act something
of glory, and satisfaction to his people, about the 18 year of his reign,
undertook a roial expedition into Ireland, transporting with him 30000 foot,
and 4000 men at Arms, as the Chronicles relate, whereat the Irish being
terrified, fell into their old lock of submissions (the very gulf which has
hitherto swallowed up all the essaies and labors of reformation there) hoping
thereby to dissolv that force, and frustrate his good design; and to insist on
the very truth, that course of pardons upon submissions of the Irish, has for
at least three hundred years past, bottomed all the combustions and insults of
the Irish.

That King being not in case to be long absent, was persuaded to accept of
their submissions, which he did from all the powerful men of the Irish, and
some degenerate English Lords, those Irish of Leimster taking Oath to leav the
Land to his free dispose by a certain time.

Great quantities of the Leimster land were granted to Sir John de Bellomonto,
and others, whose issues long after enjoyed it, he also conditioned with the
Irish of Connaght and Ulster upon their submissions, to restore the Lands to
the English, which the Irish never performed: So this young Prince abused by
the fraudulent submissions of the Irish, (as others before, and after were)
returned with his men into England, leaving the English in Ireland, in but a
little better case then he found them: Soon after his departure the Irish brake
forth, and stood up for their ends, as high as ever, whereupon ensued great
conflicts between them and the English, in one of which was slain Mortimer Earl
of March the King's Lieutenant; thereupon did many of the English (overhaled
with burdens and harrowings) relinquish their estates, and resort into
England, to side with Parties there, as their affections did lead them, though
Laws were in Ireland, and Ordinances in England, as well to stop their going,
as to return them back.

It is not recorded nor known (as is conceived) that in the reigns of King
Henry the fourth, or King Henry the fifth, (who were much taken up in other
business) any forces were sent into Ireland, whereby the Irish enlarged much,
partly through the departure of the English, and chiefly by the great
devastations they formerly suffered, besides what diminutions they endured by
several Kings, transmitting great numbers of them to assist in the wars of
France, Scotland and Wales, in several times.

In the former part of the reign of King Henry the sixth, Ireland continued In
the same posture; the English being now put to their defense in all parts, but
the greatest and most remarkable decaie, and ruin of the prosperity, and
possession of the English in Ireland began in the later end of the reign of
King Henry the sixth, and in the beginning of King Edward the fourth; For after
the middle of the reign of King Henry the sixth. Richard Duke of York beginning
to whisper his right to the Crown more audibly then before, he was soon after
sent into Ireland Lieutenant, which was sometimes usual, as a removal of such as
were dangerous, or pretended trouble; There he had given him much regal
authority more then might be consonant to right reason, had they well
considered the place, or the consequences, he was continued there nine or ten
years by himself, and his Deputies, himself making starts into England, which,
as it was handled, amplified his power in Ireland, he had power to dispose the
King's revenues, as he thought fit, he had power to grant and let the King's
Lands in Ireland, to place and displace officers, and to wage what men he
thought good: This Lord (esteemed there a person of high blood) having an eye
more upon events in England, then the reducement of Ireland, applied himself
for the most part toward his own pretentions, he entertained both parties,
English and Irish in a plausible way, traveling in his secret thoughts to
fasten parties to him, against the time he might have use of them; He
tolerated the Irish to hold what they had formerly intruded unto, not sparing
favors where he observed reason to oblige, and they regarding somewhat his high
birth (a thing they seem most to adore) were by those means held more quiet
then in former times, he contained the English by courtesy and fair
entreatie, and by bestowing of imploiments, so as he found great adherence by
way of personal affection, he made some journies into England, always
accompanied with some of the Gentry of Ireland, to propagate and ripen
confederacy; In England he endured the changes of war; At last he was forced
into Ireland, where he gather's more strength, and hearing that Warwick and
Salisburie had taken the King, he com's over, attended with good numbers of
the English Lords and others, and some of the Irish, He obtein's his ends in
Parliament; The Queen flie's into Scotland, and coming back, the Duke of York
meet's her at Wakefield, where he was slain, and many of those of Ireland
with him; the Earl of Ormond on the other side, being a professor to the house
of Lancaster, passed into England about the same time, with many of the
English, and some Irish, the Earl of March encounter's him, and others at
Mortimer's Cross in Wales; there is Ormond and the rest defeated; and many of
Ireland slain: So as what by the companies which at times passed over with the
Duke of York, and what by such as voluntarily led themselves into England, on
both sides, during those combustions, great consumptions of those of Ireland
could not but be the consequent, especially, the Gentry and best men:
Hereupon did the Irish on all sides exspatiate, and fasten upon the English
possessions, where they could reach, and indeed in short time so dilated
themselves, as they for the time forced the English into their strengths, and
into narrow rooms; they confirmed themselves in their formerly erected and
usurped Captainships, which before the reign of King Henry the eight, were far
to many, and most of them so continued, till the end of the reign of Queen
Elizabeth, therein exercising an absolute tyrannical power over all inferiors,
as well all such English as hazarded to continue amongst them, as the Irish; And
here may the Querist, and all others take full view of the progress,
footsteps, and means of the Irish encroachments upon the English possessions,
though it is true, that in after times many of the English became repossessed
of much of their ancient Lands, except in Vlster and Connaght, in which
Provinces many of the old English are now as barbarous as the mere Irish,
hardly to be distinguished; yet by what is above written, it grow's more lucid
and clear, that the Inhabitants of that Island, who now stand in arms against
England, (who in several successions settled them there) are not such an entire
nation fixed there by God and Nature, free from any other power and challenge,
as the Querist propound's them, and where the entiretie of such a Nation
(footed there as is pretended) is to be found, (as things are before
discovered) will require a very wearisom scrutinie, and at last satisfy no
understanding man. Nay, it is avouched by several good writers, and may be
truly asserted in the experience of such as well understand Ireland, that
setting aside the first Inhabitants from Britain, and other Nations inserted
there by the permission of the Britains, and such as had power in Britain, and
such as of themselves intruded before the entrance of King Henry the second,
promiscuously laced amongst them, who all now pass under the Notion, and style
of the old Irish, the very English sent in thither by King Henry the second,
and other Kings succeeding him before King James, and who at the beginning of
this Rebellion were really stated, and vested in Lands in that Island, (though
not in numbers and bodies of men (because most of the Churls, and laborers as
aforesaid, were Irish) nor perhaps in quantities and extents of Lands, yet in
true value and command, over others) did far exceed, and were far more
estimable and powerful in that Island, then those, denominated the old Irish,
besides the the great towns, which (as is above said) are wholly, in a manner,
English: for consider their present composure of persons, and affairs, even
after this late horrid and inhumane eradication of the new English and
protestants:

First, Their Nobility (now in rebellion) are all old English except a very
few, which were, and yet are both weak in power and strength.

Their supreme Council (as they call it) and other Provincial, and County
Councils, and their general Assembly are for the most part old English, most
of the best Commanders in the war are of the same; most of their horse and many
of their foot, (who have been most daring in the Rebellion) are of the same;
the whole frame of their new-Modelled-Government was at first digested, and is
ever since countenanced, and enlivened by the old English, they seem in their
constitutions to put themselves for the most part (in way of policy at
present) into the frame of the English Laws, because they well know, how
uncertain and barbarous their supposed Irish Laws were, (though very many of
them rather desire the old Irish Tyranny, and rude exorbitancie) And were it
not that the old English were, and still are, that the body of their order and
connection, even apparently managing their whole party, as to war and
Government, the rest would soon dissolv into their old Kearnish habit, both in
fight, and only confidence in bogs and woods; And which seems most of
amazement in this business, the old English (showing themselves of late years in
many things, much more swelling and envious against the Protestant Religion,
and the English Government and conversation then the mere Irish) were the
principal contrivers, and ripeners of this destable Rebellion, and
Assassination, without whose incitement and flexible concurrence, (as Ireland
at the beginning of the Rebellion stood furnished with multitudes of new English
in all parts, (except Connaght, where they were fewest) and strengthened with
the old English, if they had stood loial to their own Nation, or really
sensible of their own happiness (as in nature and all prudence they should have
don) the Irish no way durst have entered upon such an attempt against the
English and Protestants, especially a Parliament then sitting in England, who
they might well believ would so far distaste such high and unparaleld Ravages,
and horrible effusion of blood (without cause or provocation) committed upon some
of their own flesh and blood, and also such savage indignities offered to the
English Nation, as that they would speedily bend their power to redress and
revenge the same; And yet it may be considered, that the opportunity of the
attempt of the Irish will not appear so strange; when we consider their
animation, and encouragement to have its rise from many of the Native
Inhabitants of England, of the same Religion with the Irish Rebels, who made it
their work to feel the pulls, and find the distempers of England to that end:
And the Commissioners procured for the Irish to secure the persons and Estates
of the English Protestants of Ireland was to speak effectively) to command them
to destroy both, which (if not speedily executed) might have exspired or been
rewaked upon discovery, which is most obvious; it we reflect upon the several
journies of the popish party of those Agents employed by the Parliament in
Ireland, to the eminent Popish Families in England, as Brown, and Plunket have
often (with oftentation) acknowledged, besides the constant Negotiation of Mr
Brent, an English Papist and expert manager of such a business) to many of the
active Papists of England at the same time, does fully manifest the same with
suits, with the constant expressions of the Rebels, in all parts of Ireland,
affirming there could be no exspectation of any considerable, or seasonable
relief out of England. It is also too well known, that when the Cavalier
interest had life in it, the English Romanists would often boast of this their
Masterpiece their managing the Irish insurrection (as they termed it) at that
season wherein it should find least opposition from England, and so most
successful for the improvement of the Catholic cause.

The names of the old English, now stated and planted in Ireland, as can at
present be remembered of many hundreds there resident, at the beginning of this
Rebellion, and for the most part yet being there, with the mention what Noble
men are of those Families, without mentioning what greater and further Members
are of each, or any of their Names or Families, are as follloweth.

THere are 29 Families more, not there named of later descent, which have every
one a Noble man thereof, whose Estates are in Ireland. And there are but eight
noble men in Ireland of mere Irish.

So that the Nobility of English descent (not reckoning those that live in
England, who only have honors and no estates there) are seven to one of the
Irish.

And there are in all about ninety two Nobility of Ireland.

I had almost forgotten one thing of considerable value, which is this,
admitting that the pretended ancient title of the mere Irish were (as it is
not) good to the Lands of Ireland, yet nothing is more true then that great
parts thereof have been bought at dear rates, by the English from the Irish,
and more would have been, had the Irish frequent proffers a little before their
last Rebellion been accepted of by the English, to whom the Querist must need's
allow a clear interest in the Lands so purchased; as also to their personal
estates, and those that deprive them of such their Civil Right, can be no
other then thievs and robbers, and at once root out God's Law, man's property,
and National Equity, so just is this Querist to God and Nature, on whom he
would father the Irish depredations and murders; And this may in some measure
suffice for an Answer to the first Quere, at least to show how the Querist
seek's to blind inadvertent men with a far fetched supposition, which want's
substance in every particular (when examined) yet framed as an Engine to
retard all succors for Ireland, then at the point to be lost.

The second Quere.
Whether a people or Nation so settled, have not a power to establish all Laws,
Government, Offices, and Officers amongst themselves, and to oppose and execute
all such as shall endeavor, to impose and obtrude upon them, Laws, Government,
Offices and Officers, without, or against their consent.

The second Answer.
THe Irish are not such a people or Nation, so settled, have not a power to
establish all Laws, Government, etc. But the people of England, to whom Ireland
belong's, are, and have such a power to establish all Laws, Government, Offices
and Officers in Ireland, their own Dominions, and to oppose and execute all
such, as shall endeavor to impose and obtrude in their said Dominions, Laws,
Government, Offices, and Officers, without, or against their consent.

The third Quere.
WHether God and Nature having given a people and Nation such a possession of
Lands, and some other Prince or people should invade or conquer them, deprive
them of much of their Land, impose Laws, Government, and Officers upon them,
without, or against their consent; if it be any other then robbery in the
Invaders and the just right of the invaded and conquered, to cut off their
enemies, to procure their own Freedom and inheritance again?

The third Answer.
GOd and Nature has so given Ireland for a possession and Government to the
Inhabitants, and people of England, from the beginning, as in the Answer to the
first Quere is clear. And this Quere more properly relate's to the English just
title against the claim of the Irish, who were not the original Inhabiters of
Ireland, and so no claim from God and Nature for such a possession of theirs;
and therefore the Irish invasion and expulsion of the English, depriving them
of much of their Lands; framing Laws, Government, and Officers in the English
Dominions, or against the English consent, is no other then robbery in the
Irish Invaders, and it is the just right of the Invaded (and part conquered)
English to cut off their Irish enemies, and to procure theirs and their
Brethren's freedom, to regain their own lawful government and inheritance.

And for further resolution, this Quere, as it is stated, is not the case of
the Irish: For as before is truly said, the permission of the British planted,
and gave them first footing there, and the several Conquests (or rather
reducements of them) by the British there, was no invasion, but a bringing of
the rebelling Irish to due obedience, and Christian-like submission to their
supreme Governors, whose right only it is, to impose Laws, Governors, and
Officers upon them, and therefore no robbery for the English to enter on their
own Land, but most just to punish, and disseis them, who by their frequent
Rebellions were no more to be trusted with them, then a madman with a sword:
yet the indulgence of the English Government has always as been so great, as to
take but a part of the Rebel's estates, whereas they had forfeited all by their
iterated former rebellions; Then where is the cause or right of the Irish, to
cut off the English in cold blood, in time of peace, and in the best
Government, and improvement the Irish ever enjoyed?

The fourth Quere.
WHether length of time, where the original Nation is distinct from the
Conqueror, does swallow up the right of the conquered, that they have no right
to seek after, and regain their own freedoms and possessions, yea or no?

The fourth Answer.
LEngth of time cannot privilege, or discharge a people originally subordinate
to another, from their due conformity, and obedience to the Laws and
Government of those, by whose permission they were received into the Verge of
their dominions, as the Irish were into the dominions of the British in
Ireland, neither are the Irish Rebels (as now composed) a distinct Nation of
themselves, nor so distinct in descent from those, who at all times lawfully
reduced them. But that the now most ruling, and powerful party of the Rebels
are descended of English lineage, as aforesaid; and neither they, nor the other
old degenerate English can justly pretend to any Land there, but what has
been passed unto them under the great Seal of that Land, and therefore their
freedom and right cannot be any wise said to be swallowed up by the English;
for, from any other they cannot truly derive either their Freedom, Lands or
possessions, as being granted unto them by the English, and the mere Irish (as
is abovesaid) not being half of the Inhabitants of Ireland, nor of any
considerable riches, strength or policy.

The fifth Quere.
HOw can the conquered justly be called, or accounted Rebels, if any time,
they shall seek and endeavor to free themselves, and to regain their own Lands
and Liberties?

The fifth Answer.
THe Inhabitants of Ireland, now in Arms against the power and just right of
England, are no better then perfidious rebels, intruders, and inhumane
blood-suckers, not only for the causes before showed, but for their iterated
Rebellions, and former massacring of the English, and have been well known to
be such brutish enemies for diverse ages past; And if it should be allowed,
that they at their wills and pleasures might shake off the yoke of obedience,
and to perpetrate the inhumane cruelties, semblable to their former, then would
they at length (as it were) change their shape of men into the state of Devils.

The sixth Quere.
WHether Julius Caesar, Alexander the great, William Duke of Normandy, or any
other the great Conquerors of the world, were any other then so many great
and lawless thievs; And whether it be not altogether as unjust to take our
neighbor Nations, Lands, and liberties from them, as our neighbor's goods of
our own Nation?

The sixth Answer.
HEre might I now suspend further labor (as superfluous, in contesting with
extravagant impertinencies, having expended much time upon the main. But I have
already (as I conceiv) irrecoverably thrown down the false foundation, upon
which this presumptuous Impostor does rear the whole fabric of his insnaring
Queres. In the fall whereof they are slaughtered, as I may say, in the
mother's belly, resolved, before well objected, and may be left as dead, and
buried in their first ruins, yet since the easiest part of my task is now
behind, I will wave the trouble I might justly avoid in being filent, and
crave leav to proceed in the solution of the remaining interrogations to their
utmost borders, lest by such silence I should give advantage to the contriver
of them, to surfeit with conceit of his supposed unanswerable suggestions.

By this question that now look's so big, stare's us in the face, and speak's
so loud; the Querist may drive some of mean Judgment into amazement, though
indeed he manifests but a weakness in that his endeavor, to render the
English title dubious, and make our Nation, persons, and interest, odious by an
infamous indicting of us under the notion of thievs, robbers, invaders, etc.
Only for our credit thus much, he arraign's with us, or us with them, the
great Conquerors of the world, Julius Caesar, Alexander the great, and William
the Norman, in whom (indeed) all the great Rulers of the earth are concerned
and comprehended by this pernicious stickler for Irish Rebels; of whose
ridiculous folly being senfible enough, I give him no other Answer then a
flat and express denial to that he aim's to gain by a confession on our part,
and what he is not able to prove on his own; But I lay hold upon that which
(undesired) he grant's unto us in the question, and then to answer the Quere.

Taking him therefore upon his own confession, he who els-where strongly
endeavor's to smother our original propriety, and interest, does there beslow
upon us a fourfold good title (if other things should fail) to that Land, unto
which they the Irish so unjustly pretend; As in his several Queres, first a
conquest; Secondly, a prescription, and actual possession in the British;
Thirdly, a Legislative power; fourthly their subjection, (though a distinct
people, yet living amongst us) unto the English Government.

The Answer now follows, which is reduced to these affirmative positions.

First, that the Conquerors therein mentioned, and comprehended, ought not to
carry the character of lawless thievs.

Secondly, that titles and dominions achieved by conquest, are not robberies,
but justifiable titles and possessions.

The first of these concern's the person of the Conqueror, the second the right
of the things possessed. Might we but propound one Quere to this bold
Assertor, it should be this.

What Author can he produce for this profane and absurd Language? the worst of
profane histories afford no pattern to these expressions.

Is a Conqueror no more then a Bandetto, a Pirate, a Barrabas, or one of the
Arabian fraternities? Must the actions of public persons empowered by God,
acted by divine impulsions, and oftentimes executing for God an unknown
Commission against the Inhabitants of the world for their transgressions, be
stained with, and carry the black Character of Lawless thievs; Surely no, this
is not the language of the servant of the living God, but of the servant of the
lying spirit, the false accuser.

What if the actions of these Conquerors be chargeable with some
irregularities, and personal vitiosities usually concurrent in victories. They
may be matters of lamentation to the world, and sad accounts too; but no
ground for such denominations.

To instance.

Let us pitch upon Nebuchadnezzar that Babylonian Monarch, called The hammer of
the whole earth, the great destroier of Nations, Dan. 2.7. Jer. 50.23.
was he not one of the worst of Adversaries unto the people of God, witness
Sion's complaint against him, Jer. 51.34; 35.
yet was ever this infamous title attributed to him by any of the captivated
people.

Nay, does not God speak of him in terms of honor, looking on him as an
instrument to act his own design, being one of the rods of his anger, and the
staff of his indignation, styling him oftentimes My servant, and his work his
service, Jer. 25.9. Jer. 27.6. Ezekiel. 29.18, 19, 20. Dan. 6.21. Dan. 2.37.
and one unto whom God for his own work assigned Egypt for the wages of his
Army; And does not Daniel the servant of the living God, and a Captive of the
blood Roial, honor him with the awful terms and title of Magistracy in these
words; O King, live for ever.

What shall we say of Caesar Octavius, under whose Government the Savior of
the world was born, by whose power the Jewish Nation were kept in subjection,
does not the Evangelist St Luke put that Roman stamp of dignity (Augustus)
upon him: Nomen quasi Sanctum and veneratione dignum, says Burgensis, The Jews
gave him the title of a lawful Magistrate, and a King, saying, we have no
King, but Caesar. Augustine had reverend language toward the Cesarian Armies,
affirming this, Autores belli Dei ministri; and in his Epistle to Boniface a
military Commander in the Roman Legions uses these words: Nequaquam putare
debes eos qui rei-publicae inserviunt, Deo placere non posse: John the Baptist
(who lost his head for the freedom of his Language) when the Cesarian soldiers
of the meaner rank frequented his Ministry, did not bid them lay down their
Arms as unlawful, or frown upon them as thievs, or discourage them with such
Dialects, but discipline's them as Scholars for the School of Christ. Do
violence to no man, and be content with your wages. John.
If God from the mouth of the holy son, style's them servants; If holy men
taught by the Spirit of God, and religious knowing men never took up such
vilifying Language against the great Conquerors of the world, and the hammers
of the earth the Assyrians, the Persians, the Grecians, and the Romans to whom
the supreme Lord of all gave the Kingdoms and Dominions of the earth; how
unwarrantable will it be for the sons of men to open their mouths
contumeliously against the Ministers of the Lord of Hosts, into whose hands he
has put the revenging sword, and crowned it with victory, thereby declaring
the secret purposes of his good pleasure, concerning those people against whom
they are sent, and preordained for Justice and Judgment.

Having thus settled the unquestionable title of honored Majesty upon such
Conquerors, and vindicated them from the black infamy (the Language of hell,
and not of Saints) which the Querist would intail upon them, I now com to make
good my second Position, in answer to this sixth Quere.

A title or dominion atteined by Conquest is not robbery, as the Conquerors
are not lawless thievs, Jer. 27.4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Dan. 2.37.39. Isa. 36.10. 2
King. 18.25.
God putting all their acquirements by Conquests upon the account of his own
free donation, and not upon robbery or theft.

Take a short view of mutations in the world made by Conquests in former ages:
May not the same be affirmed from thence, and other parallel Scriptures, that
the mutations and revolutions of Crowns and Kingdoms, Governments and
Governors, the breaking in and casting out of Nations, are the effect of divine
ordination, managed and brought to pass by exorbitant and irregular motions of
men, publicly empowered, and by extraordinary provocations raised up to the
attempting of actions, above the rank and sphere of ordinary dispensations.
Dan. 4.17.
Is not the power of God still the same, to give his kingdoms of the earth,
when, and to whom he pleases.

It was the Judgment of Peter Martyr, writing de Jure belli, Non tantum a
principio mutationes factas esse, sed in posterioribus, tempore belli; Later
ages will produce Mutations in times of war, as well as former.

And then why may not befall to those Inhabitants of Ireland (which challenge
the Land to be given them by God and Nature) that which has betided other
Nations, by the secret counsels of that God, in whose hands the Inhabitants of
the earth are tossed as a ball?

Did not Eneas by conquest of the Latins settle his posterity in Italy? did
not the Franks, by invasion and conquests take possession of Gallia (now their
native habitation)? was not Britain in France surprised by the power of the
English Saxons, and from them denominated, continuing in their possession to
this day? Did not the Huns become Masters of Pannonia (now of them called
Hungary;) And to conclude, is not Conquest an universal title throughout the
world? Is not that Jus gentium quod ubique valet; And if this Jus Belli stand
for a Plea for them, why may not we then say as the Civillians fully resoly
the lawfulness and propriety of things gotten by war in this known Maxim, Ea
quae ab hostibus capiuntur, jure gentium statim fiunt capientium.

I cannot omit some material instances, and so conclude the Answer to this
Quere, whereby the present acting power of a Conqueror is allowed, and approved
in an usurper by the Lord Jesus Christ, who was born under an usurping power to
teach us, as a judicious Commentator observ's, Indicat deinde ipsa nativitate
se non pellere magistratum ordinarium adventu suo, imo approbare, who, besides
his universal title to all the world, had an indubitable title and claim to the
temporal Kingdom of the Jews, then under the Roman usurping power, (Witness
that ancient Manuscript, Michael Nauclerus de Monarchia divina, ex libro
vaticano) yet did so far submit unto the title of Conquest, and his intrusion,
that he the lawful heir was contented to become a Subject in his own Land,
Eodem tempore quo mu^ti Tyranni occupabant; though all power was his, and he
that little stone foretold that he should be cut out of the Mountain, etc.
yet he neither smite's them with tongue, Dan. 2.45.
nor opposes them by practice, but practically uses and teaches obedience by
paying tribute, yea, becom's an Advocate for Cesar's interest; Give unto Caesar
that which is Cesar's, and in a word was so far from exclaiming against that
Roman (though usurping) authority, that he looking up to Heaven, affirm's the
invader's powers to be of God, and therefore afterward submit's to an unjust
Sentence of death, whose steps, the holy Apostle following, and filled with
the Spirit of the same Christ, the only blessed potentate does in express
terms, without exclusion, Romans 13. v. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
enjoin submission to all sorts of powers, etc. He saie's not, they have no
title, they came in by Conquest, they are thievs, Robbers, but honor's them
with the title of lawful Magistrates, and command's the conquered Subject upon
pain of damnation, to afford obedience unto them as the Ministers of God, using
these words, that all powers that be, are of God.

And for the later part of this Quere, viz Whether it be not altogether as
unjust to take our neighbor's Lands and Liberties from them, as our neighbor's
goods from our own Nation? I^ is answered, that although the Irish have very
long usurped the possession of the Lands and Liberties of the English in
Ireland (being the Lands and Liberties in the neighboring Country, which the
Querist means, and which of right, and from antiquity, and so until this
day do truly and justly belong to the Engliish, as in the first Quere is
resolved:) Yet neither when this present Rebellion brake out in Ireland, nor of
a number of years before, were any Lands or Liberties unjustly taken, held, or
detained from any the Rebels of Ireland.

And he can pretend to nothing but dull ignorance, that know's it not to have
been still consistent, with the Laws and Customs as well of England, as of other
civil Nations of the world, to seiz, and take the goods and liberties of such
neighbors of their own Nation, as would not stoop to obedience, but Rebel
against the known Laws of any Land where they lived, especially, wilful
Law-breakers, such as should first begin, and attempt depredations, and
surprising of the goods and estates of the obedient parties; the like Laws
being for such contemners and Rebels also, in such cases to lose their lives.

The seventh Quere.
WHether God at the last day will not call men to an account, even for those
things which they are unaccountable for here, as great Conquerors are?

The seventh Answer.
GOd at the last day will justify all men, that zealously execute the work of
his own righteous justice, and that are instrumental in the propagation of his
truth and glory, as the English now are, and as (I am confident) they will
persist in Ireland (their own Country) against, and upon the wicked
Inhabitants thereof, the Irish Rebels, who for their abominations, as I may
boldly say, stink in the nostrils of the Lord, and of all his servants, and
must at last (without doubt) be brought to an account for all their
ungrateful, inhumane, bloody and barbarous actions, wherein the hand of the
Lord is most visible unto us, having already brought many to the sword,
destroyed some by famine, but far more by pestilence, and other ways of his
Justice, and now those, whose persons as yet met not with those Judgments, and
proudly triumphed over, and stood upon the necks of the deplorable, This at
large appears by the examinations taken at Dublin, upon oath.
and infinitely distressed English, do like dust before the wind fly from the
faces of our English Protestant soldiers, not daring to justify the least of
their acts or undertakings, but for refuge fly to Mountains, woods, bogs, and
other obscure and unaccessible places, cursing now the first plotters,
contrivers, and beginners of their Rebellion, and hellish designs. And does not
the Querist think that many of these bloudsuckers in this world, and the rest
in the world to com shall meet with condign punishment suitable to their
demerits?

The eighth Quere.
WHether the condition of the conquered be not Ireland, and the condition of
the Conquerors be not England, and Ireland unjustly termed Rebels, and their
cause just, and England a thieving usurping Tyranny, and their cause altogether
unjust, being against God and Nature, and therein, such as no judicious
conscientious man can assist, or bid God speed?

The eighth Answer.
THe condition of the conquered is not Ireland, being (as aforesaid) not a
distinct nation and people, but the greatest part of them consisting of
English, or those from thence extracted: And the several Conquests of them, but
reducements to legal and civil obedience, to the just and proper right and
interest of England. Nor can the condition of the Conquerors of them be, as
over an absolute Nation: therefore the Inhabitants of Ireland, now in arms
against the just rights and propriety of England, are properly and palpably
Rebels, and their cause unjust, and England's a legal power, right and
Government, and their cause altogether just, being for God and Nature; For God,
to punish the rebellious, wicked, and obstinate, to root out Idolatry, to
plant and dress the Lord's Vineyard, by holding out the glorious light of the
truth, and not suffer it to be covered or trampled on: For Nature, such as all
judicious, conscientious men will assist, and bid God speed unto, being to
redeem their brethren, the dispoiled Protestants in Ireland, restore them to
their just and lawful possessions, vindicate the robberies, murders, tortures,
rapes, and inhumane cruelties, barbarously executed on them, and reduce that
Country to Peace and quietness.

The ninth Quere.
WHether it be not the duty of every honest man, by all fair and peaceable
means, to endeavor the diverting of the States, from the prosecution of so
unjust a cause, especially, decline all means where himself might promote the
same: but to show his utter dislike of it?

The ninth Answer.
IT is the duty of every honest man, by all earnest, zealous, and lawful
means, to endeavor the encouragement and furtherance of the State of England,
for their prosecution of their so just a cause, especially to undertake all
means, and to run through all difficulties, whereby he himself might promote
the same, and show his willingness unto, and good liking of it, and he neither
is, nor can be a good Christian, that will not contribute to the suppression
of these Idolaters, murderers, and apparent enemies of God.

The tenth Quere.
Whether those that conted for their freedom (as the English now) shall not
make themselves altogether unexcusable, if they shall entrench upon other's
freedoms: And whether it be not an especial note, and characterizing badg of a
true pattern of freedom, to endeavor the just freedom of all men, as well as
his own?

The tenth Answer.
THose that contend for their freedom (as the ^aglish now) who are backed and
seconded by original just Principles, fundamental Laws, inherent Rights, legal
and due grants, and acknowledgment of their rights from their former accepted
Governors, make's the resolution flatly opposite unto, and inconsistent with
the rebellious Inhabitants of Ireland; who have neither original Principles,
fundamental Laws, inherent Rights, legal and due grants, and acknowledgments of
their rights, from their former rightful Governors, in any sort or manner,
distinct and separate from the right, power, and Government of England over
them; But as a member to the body, so is Ireland to England; And therefore
England need's no excuse, but is every way justifiable to rectify, or cut
off a corrupt, rebellious and gangrened member, who never had imposed on it, or
retained any other defect, restriction, or freedom then the whole body
suffered. And if the endeavors of England have been so candid, as to make
Ireland a fellow-member of its own freedom, and enjoyment of Laws and Liberty,
equal with it self, in such of the Inhabitants as are capable and deserving the
same, it is a special note and characterizing badg of a true Pattern of
freedom, to bring such as belong to them into the like condition of themselves,
and to suppress those in Ireland, as well as those in England that oppose the
same.

The Eleventh Quere.
Whether in Judgment and Conscience the Irish are not to be justified, in all
that they have don against the English in Ireland, and in complying with,
assisting, and seeking assistance from any that would, or will be England's
enemies, to preserv, and deliver them from the cruelty and usurpation of the
English, rather then to become slaves to their wills; And whether the English
would not do as the Irish do, were they in like condition?

The eleventh Answer.
IF Traitors, murderers, ravishers, robbers, cruel inhumane persecutors of
true Christians, sacrilegious, abominable Idolaters are justifiable, then are
the Inhabitants of Ireland, now in arms against the English, to be justified;
But if by the Law of God and man, such of their partakers, Abettors, and
countenancers are to be prosecuted and punished by those, into whose hands God
has put the sword of legal power, and just Government, as now in the English;
Then in Judgment and conscience, the said Inhabitants of Ireland deserv sharp
prosecution and just condemnation, and the rather, for that they (to uphold
themselves in their mischief) have against their duty and Ioialtie to the
lawful Government and right of England assisted, and sought assistance from
such as are, and always have been England's professed enemies, and therefore,
for the English to endeavor the acquifition of their own just rights, and to
punish those rebellious, obstinate, and inhumane inhabitants of Ireland, is but
their duty, and so, conscience, not cruelty, equity and just right; not
usurpation. They deserving the greatest severitie for their falsehood and
treachery, who so exorbitantly abused the greatest freedom that ever any
Nation enjoied, and were not made slaves to the will of the English
Protestants, but for many years past, had as much freedom (and far more) then
their evil manners rendered them capable of.

The twelfth Quere.
Whether the English would account any thing cruelty enough for them, to
exercise upon the Irish, if the Irish should dispossess them in England, and
tyrannize over them here, as the English have don over them there, if
afterward the English should get the upper hand?

The twelfth Answer.
THe English never dispossed nor tyrannized over the Irish, either in Ireland,
or England, but contrariwise were ever indulgent and loving to them; and now as
the English will account nothing severe enough (if warrantable by God's Law)
for them to execute upon the rebellious Irish, if they should dispossess the
English in England, and tyrannize over them here, as they, the Irish, have most
unlawfully don over English Protestants in Ireland: So it is warrantable by
God's Law to recover their right in Ireland, and by the same Law (if they get
the upper hand) severely to prosecute and punish the blood-guiltie Inhabitants
of Ireland, it being a duty and trust imposed on them by God, against such
Idolaters and murderers, and none ought, (without great offense) but prosecute
such a cause with effect.

The thirteenth Quere.
WHether it be not the duty of the English Nation, rather to repent of the
oppression, usurpation and intrusion of themselves, their Kings and forefathers,
then with a high hand to pursue those designs of violence?

The thirteenth Answer.
IT is the part and duty of the English Nation rather to prosecute, and force
the rebellious member Ireland to repent their oppression, usurpation and
intrusion into the right and Government of the English, and for their violent
depriving them and their harmless neighbors of their Liberties, lives, goods,
Lands, and other Estates, and for the English to recover their own rights, (in
all ages made good by the expense of their fore-father's blood and treasure)
and with a high hand to pursue the designs of the opposers; and where the
English never oppressed, usurped, or intruded upon the Irish, there they need
no repentance.

The fourteenth Quere.
WHether (if they shall still pursue the same) it will not maintain a lasting
chargeable war, to be a large and strange footing for the enemies to England's
peace to stand upon, to render the Nation to be no true lovers of freedom, but
of domination, give occasion to the enemies to blaspheme, make our Religion
odious, and by perpetual piracie even utterly spoil all our trade by Sea, and
so be at the last our own ruin, and whether the gain at the last by a perfect
conquest over them (which is uncertain) will equipoiz all that charge and
blood, that must be spilt for the obteining of the same, especially
considering their eternal loss, dying in the prosecution of so unjust a cause?

The fourteenth Answer.
IF they, the English, now in the nick of time pursue the Irish Rebels,
considering the present power and posture that England is in, and the great
number of its able bodies fit for emploiment, which on a settled peace at home
cannot be better employed or bestowed, then in so conscionable a service,
conducing to the honor and glory of God, the peace and quiet of all the
Dominions of England, the advance of Trade, the terror of England's enemies,
the gaining of a most fruitful and plentiful receptacle for a flowing
offspring, (if now so enabled) they shall effectually pursue the service
against the Rebels in Ireland, (being so disseminated and scattered as they
now are) it will not maintein a lasting chargeable war. For now but a competent
number to be sent out of England, with those faithful and noble ones, their
Commilitants now there will (doubtless) by God's gracious assistance, do the
blessed work of reducing them, and remove the largest and strongest footings
the enemies of England have gotten, render the Nation of England to be true
Lovers of Freedom, and the noble preservers of that part of their body and
dominion; This also will take away all occasion from the enemy to blaspheme,
since the true worship and service of God will be advanced in place of
idolatrous Popetie, (so much of late years hazarding the peace of England) make
our Religion (that true one indeed) beautiful, lovely, and delightful; free our
Seas from the brood of Dunkirkers, Pickaro's, and others of the like stamp (
Irish Pirates) when they shall have no place of harbor, or retirement amongst
us, whereby trade will be advanced; And so in a short time, may a firm and
lasting peace and safety be acquired, the gain whereof will not only
equipoiz, but outballance all the charge that can be spent, for obteining of
the same. The blood that may be spilt therein is in the dispofing of the Lord
Armipotent, the God of Battle, from whom our small handfuls of men have not
only met with glorious, and most strange, and often deliverances, far
transcending the thoughts of natural man, in all their former engagements, but
may (doubtless) exspect it still; and for those that fall in the Lord's ba^^,
they die not, but to live eternally in and with him, the true knowledge of whom
teaches us, that all our days are numbered, and that not one life shall be
lost, but by his fore purpose and divine appointment, who will still especially
in our greatest weakness, cover us with his shield in the day of battle, and
enable us to trample on the necks of his, and our enemies, and which is far
more excellent, they shall surely be members of the Church, and live amongst
the Saints triumphant, whose death shall happen in a cause so just (God's cause.)
And here it may be noted that the Irish Rebels by their last immane cruelties,
filling up the measure of their iniquity seem to be a people adopted by
providence, to an utter exstirpation. Whereunto all faithful Englishmen have a
call from Heaven, in vindication of that innocent blood, there most profusely
spilt, without leaving that detestable brand of Astorgism upon the English
Nation to perpetuity.

The Fifteenth Quere.
Whether it be not the duty of the State, and Trustees of the Nation, rather
to mind, seek and preserv the general peace, safety, and welfare of the whole
Nation, then the honors and profits of particular men; And whether particulnr
men may not in an humble and peaceable manner present their thoughts to the
State for a general good?

The fifteenth Answer.
THe whole Quere is affirmatively confessed, and therefore it is hoped, that
Ireland (a Country appropriate to this Nation, and the major part of
Inhabitants there of English descent will be looked on, not as the honors and
profits of particular men, but as a general concernment; the desertion whereof
will redound to the honors and profits of particular men, enemies to the peace
and welfare of England, the most malignant of its enemies, the Papists; and
therefore particular, peaceable, well-affected men ought in an humble and
peaceable manner, to present their thoughts thereof to the State for a general
good.

The sixteenth Quere.
WHether if the State of England should now in their full strength proclaim
Ireland a free State, repenting of all the evils that themselves have acted and
intended, and that our King has formerly acted against that Nation; and that
they will not further act to their prejudice, but only sit down by them as a
neighbor-State, as Holland does, and that they only desire that they may be
in mutual league, and as friends to seek the peace and welfare of each other,
that they will not countenance, assist, or protect each other's enemies, nor
any that shall disturb the peace, or safety of any of the Nation, and only
require some considerable Sea-Port-Towns as security, and bond to tie the Irish
to the performance of the Covenants; I say, whether this may not be every
way as advantageous to the State, and people of England, as a conquest over
them, the charge considered?

The sixteenth Answer.
IF the State of England should now in their full strength proclaim Ireland a
free State, and do further, as in the Quere is propounded: yet our true
knowledge and experience of the Rebel's disposition promonisheth that they will
be still (especially upon any occasion of advantage) forward and ready to
the uttermost of their powers, and malice, to cut their benefactor's throats,
besides it would be the most prejudicial act that could be imagined against
the State, and people of England; For set aside the honor due to almighty God,
in giving up that Country from his true worship and service, to Idolatry and
profaneness; set aside their guilt of the innocent blood of our brethren,
kindred, and Nation there, barbarously poured out, which will doubtless hang
over the heads of the Pardoners; set aside the utter overthrow, and loss of
many thousands of Families, their goods, and Estates, and the giving up the
poor (yet considerable) remain of the English Protestant party there, to the
disposition of their most cruel enemies; Set aside the blood and treasure there
spent out of England, since the rebellion, wherein not a Family in England but
is interessed, and which they exspect not to be rendered fruitless, to the
dishonor of the whole Nation; Set all these aside: yet humane reason and
policy dictate's, that the House cannot be safe so long as the back door is
open. The father wrong's his posterity, if he lavishly give away half his
inheritance, the regaining whereof, hereafter may be a cause of ten fold loss
of blood and treasure, to what it may cost in preservation; that it is neither
safe or just in the Law of Nature, to fling away any part of our Arms, or
defense, though at present cumbersom, which may advantage the enemy by taking
possession of, and using (as the popish party will) against us: And say the
right and interest of England to Ireland, were not so great, clear, and
undeniable as it is: yet the late revolutions considered, England must never
exspect to be advantaged, or any way bettered by deserting Ireland, and
giving it up to the Rebellious Inhabitants; A people so foully and lately
treacherous to the Protestants, and later English. Which people are neither so
formidable in their best arms, defenses, and power to keep themselves in such a
proclaimed condition or freedom; Nor is it the aim, or mark of their new
Grandees to effect and maintein it, whose divisions and contrary inclinations
amongst themselves, are, and will ever be a ready and open gap for any
England's enemies to enter in at: And say they have no realitie in them to a
kingly claim, (as without doubt they have not, they having now of late made
amongst them so many new Kings) yet it were an Act of destructive and
dangerous consequence, to give Ireland to the disposal of the Pope, and he to
the Spaniard (his dear child) which the Inhabitants of Ireland are not much
against, but contrariwise, many of them desire it, and which undoubtedly (if
not prevented) would happen: And so that bit be brought into the mouth of the
Spaniard, which he has so long gaped after to swallow and devour.

And admit that Ireland were of the Protestant Religion, as well as England,
and thereby the above inconveniences avoided: yet were it neither safe nor
commendable, to quit the dependence of that Island on England, by proclaiming
the Inhabitants thereof a free State; since what such a State might do upon
very slender grounds and mistakes, let Scotland witness.

The resolution therefore is; that to do as this Quere propound's, is extreme
loss, hazard, and disadvantage to the people of England, and the reducement of
that Country to its lawful dependence and Government of England, by a full
conquest of the present Rebels (let the charge be what it will) is more
honorable, safe, profitable and advantageous to England, then to proclaim them
a free State, who are not in a capacity to make and keep themselves so, nor are
or ever were a distinct Nation, as is before said, and here take notice, how
the Querist propound's a suitable reward indeed for the State of England, to
bestow upon the Re^^^^^ of Ireland, for murdering their kindred and allies,
acknowledging the said Rebels a free State, and in amity with them, and
thereby for ever to quit their own undoubted interest, establish the worst of
their enemies, become guilty of the unparalleled murders of those, that were
flesh of their flesh, and bone of their bone, and leav the remnant of the poor
English there, continually open to the rapine of those whose mercies are
cruelties. So as the Querist would work the State of England into an impious
unprovident, and unnatural desertion of the cause of God, their own interest and
National quarrel.

The seventeenth Quere.
Whether Ireland were not altogether as like to accept of protection safety,
and defen^e from the State and people of England, as from Spain or any other
Nation, especially would they not rather then from Prince Charles, Rupert or
from such like forlorn Soldiers, how would they then style the malignant Party
inconsiderable, And whether they were not then likely suddenly to recall their
Sea-Pirats, and so suddenly set open all Trade by Sea?

The seventeenth Answer.
Because the Rebellious Inhabitants of Ireland have cast off their obedience to
the government of England, and (as is too well known) have plotted, and, as
far as they could, indeavored the utter ex^tirpation of the English
Protestants, have in coolness of blood (and without any provocation given them)
maliciously and most barbarously murdered, some hundreds of thousands of them,
driven the rest from their habitations, robbed them of their Estates, wounded,
maimed, and most miserably entreated great numbers of others, have burned their
houses, Casiles and Churches, and have elected and made to and amongst
themselves several new Kings, viz. the Pope, the King of Spain, Owen Mc Art O
Neil, Sr Phelim O Neil, The Lord Maguire (since deceased) O Conner Dun of
Sligoh, Philip Mc Hugh Mc Sane O Rely, Dermot Mc Doolin Cavenagh, and one O
Shergil; as does and will fully appear in the examinations taken in that
behalf, and because also those rebellious Irish have declined all English
government, returned to their barbarous manners and customs, have set up a new
government, have vowed (and many of them taken the Sacrament) to destroy not
only all the men, women and children of the English Protestants, but also all
irrational Creatures of the English breed, and because also they have in a most
high manner, and as far as they could, profaned the Churches, books and days
of God's true worship, have brought to death as many Professors of his truth,
as they could possibly surprise, and have dilated their power and strength, in
the acting and perpetrating of any crime destructive to the English
Protestants; and which might render themselves incapable of mercy, protection
or safety from the people of England, therefore none ought to be given them;
nor ought the sword (now justly and upon necessity drawn out against them) be
returned to the Scabbard, before that destruction they denounced, and resolved
to execute upon the English, be retaliated upon themselves, and least such
mercy be recompensed with a curs as the holy Ghost by the Prophet, in a case
such semblance, pronounced Jer. 28.10. Cursed be be that does the work of the
Lord negligently, and cursed be he that keeps back his Sword from blood.

But I wonder from what the Querist mean's they should be protected, saved or
defended; if he intend it to be from that punishment, they have so justly
merited, by their Rebellion and wickedness past, according to that protection,
and those Concessions they lately had by Compact with Ormond, grounded upon a
Commission from the late King Charle; To that I answer, That if the indulgent
English should grant it to them, no doubt they would accept, and make use of
it, so long as they should find it to promote and be consistent with their own
ends, and surely they would to themselves take up no little glory to meet with
such a color of justification, as they might thereby transferr their odious
guilt upon the Protectors, so much elevate the policy and wit of the old
Serpent (their dread Lord and Master) above the English Protestant genius; and
be thereby also the further enabled to destroy the remaining Party of the
Protestants in Ireland (too precious we hope) to be the price of their
security. But for further resolution,

These rebellious Inhabitants of Ireland, are so contemptuous to the English
laws, so opposite in profession to the English Protestant, so hardened in their
wickedness, envy and hatred against God's truth, and them, for the truth's
sake, and so will ully bent to persist, as, till suppressed, they will not omit,
but contrariwise with greediness, draw into their confederacy, countenance and
assistance any, whether foreign Prince or other person, and never think
themselves in good condition or safety, until (if possible) they have sounded
the dreinings of the English veins, to their abyss, through their deepest lakes
of blood, and have brought the undestroied part of the English to the lowest
ebb of tranquillity, which they will endeavor to effect and hasten on, as well
by Sea as Land, and have in most esteem all malignant Parties, lending a hand,
and enabling them to effect it. But the Lord prevent them.

Something may be said concerning Edmond Gawre, who delivered the formerly
recited and answered cavilling Queres to Mr Theodore Jennings, who delivered
them over to the Lord President of the Council of State, as that it is very
like lie he is an Irishman, and one whom (by credible information) does or
lately did covertly and cnnningly shelter among the soldierie, in or about
Londor, and is a Jesuitical Papist, for the very Queres themselves smell of the
breath of a Jesuit, the truth whereof may do well, if found out by inquisition
after his present being, parentage and education, which is left to the
discretion of those eminent persons in anthoritie, the Impostor^s then present
drift being to retard and hinder (if possible) forces and succors from our
Party in Ireland at that time, when the Land was in greatest danger to be
^ent and taken from us.

FINIS.
