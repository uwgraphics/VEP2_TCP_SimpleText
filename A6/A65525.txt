Humbly Presented, FOR RAISING 40000 l. per Annum with great Facility, by a Duty
that may be laid on the Postage of LETTERS, Viz.
WHich Duty thus Humbly Proposed, may likely meet with little Opposition, it
not affecting any Art or Mystery in particular.

Letters not exceeding one Sheet within 80 Miles, which pays 2 d. is Proposed
to Advance 1 d. Letters not Exceeding Two Sheets within 80 Miles pays 4 d. to
advance 2 d. Ounces of Pacquets and Deeds within 80 Miles, pays 8 d. to Advance
4 d. Letters not Exceeding one Sheet, and above 80 Miles, pays 3 d. to Advance
1 d. Letters not Exceeding two Sheets, and above 80 Miles, pays 6 d. to Advance
2 d. Ounces of Pacquets and Deeds above 80 Miles, pays 12 d. to Advance 4 d.
Foreign Letters not Exceeding one Sheet, to Advance proportionable. Foreign
Letters not Exceeding two Sheets, Foreign Pacquets Inward, per Ounce, Likewise
all Letters, Pacquets and Ounces, not here Inferred, Chargeable as per Act of
Parliament 12 Car. II. Penny-Post-Letters Single to Advance in the Bills of
Mortality All Parcels, not exceeding one pound, to Advance 1 d. All Letters or
Parcels, Exceeding the Bills of Mortality, to Advance 1 d.

It Is Humbly Presumed no Duty can be less Chargeable or Difficult then this, it
being considered how Regularly it may be Managed at the Grand Post Office.

If it be supposed, That this Proposal may lessen the Revenue;

It Is Humbly Answered, as Conceived, That Letters generally are of more Moment,
then to be Omitted for so small Addition as this is.
