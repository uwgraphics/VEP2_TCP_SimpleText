The word of God to all the Elect number with a few words in a deep Lamentation
over the seed of Life, to its tender Father concerning them that have
transgressed in Israel.
DEar blessed precious Lambs and Babes, ye children of the most high God, holy
innocent and undefiled, I feel a Remnant a very small Remnant, that are but few
in number, with whom my life dwells in pure unity never to be separated, that
God Almighty has gathered and is gathering in this day of his mighty power
from amongst all people, nations, kindreds, Countries tongues and languages,
upon the face of the whole Earth, who shall be one of a Family and two of a
Tribe, which is but very few in number, even you shall shine, as the lights of
heaven, glorious as the Sun, clear as the Moon, Glittering and sparkling as the
Stars. Yea, the very brightness of your pure light, and beauty of your glory
shall shine from corner to corner, and from end to end of all the world, that
so all nations may see, and hear yea dread tremble and fear. But you must and
shall come through many and great tribulations and be refined even as the pure
gold, that is seven times tried in the fire, and must have your garments died
in the blood of the Lamb, and be clothed in fine Linning clean and white, mark
that, it must be clean and white there must be no filthyness neither any
defilement: not one spot nor blemish, for if there be while that remains,
Mark while any spot remains thou may not be suffered to dwell with the
Lamb and to follow him whethersoever he goes, who is of more purer eyes then
to behold iniquity, so the pure Virgin state every particular must witness
before the heir of life can be born to whom all power belongs in Heaven and in
Earth and power sufficient to withstand the power of the wicked one in all his
temptations can never be received till he the heir of life is born up in
dominion over all, and has the government upon his shoulders, and now may not
the cry of many be who has been long convinced even as the cry of some of the
Disciples was when the Lord said, he that eats my flesh and drinks my blood
dwells in me and I in him as the living Father has sent me, and I live by
the Father even so he that eats me shall live by me, shall live by me, this
is that bread that came down from Heaven, not as your fathers did eat Manna
and are dead, he that eats this bread shall live for ever. Did they not then
cry out this is an hard saying who can abide the hearing of it, and did not
many of his Disciples from that very time go back and forsake him, and walked
no more with him, then said Jesus to the Twelve, Will ye also go away then
Simon Peter answered him Lord to whom shall we go, thou have the words of
Eternal life, and we believe and are sure that thou art Christ the Son of the
living God.

My dear Friends, I do not write thus to you only as it is the Scriptures
Language neither because you know it not already but even as the Lord has
given it me in his own eternal word of Life and power, therefore every one
search your own hearts try your selves even all the secret motions of your
minds and all your deep thoughts, and see with the light of Christ in you
whether or no your hearts are upright, and approved of in the sight of the
Righteous God. Who searches secretly all your hearts and tryes your reins
whose name is the Lord of Host the Almighty and wonderful Counselor and
Conqueror very dreadful and terrible to all his enemies before whom, and in
whose presence ye are all naked and bare, to whom you must all give up your
accounts whether Just or Unjust and the time is near at hand: Therefore my Dear
friends, see that every one of you lay true Judgment to the line, and
Righteousness to the Plummet, and all Judge your selves least you be Judged and
try with the pure holy Light in your own Consciences whether or nay, ye are of
that number as is before mentioned for verily and in Gods name I am made bold
in his everlasting authority and endless dominion to declare it, none other
shall dwell with the Lamb in the new City Sion for ever more, therefore O
weigh it in the deep Considerations of your pure mind. For I do proclaim it in
the name of the Lord our God and shall be ready to seal it with my Dearest
blood, ye have already received the first and last and greatest Message or
dispensation that ever was is or ever shall be, therefore look not for another
but always in that you have already received grow and increase, holding fast
that you have and letting nothing of it go least another take your Crown and to
rob you of your honor, even the pure holy and undefiled Light, and whosoever
shall presume to declare of any other or a greater dispensation then that which
has been declared of already let him or them to you be accursed for evermore
if an Angel or Angels from heaven for such do and will pervert the way of God,
and so will strive, to lead poor simple innocent persons, people after them
into their own pernissious ways quite contrary to the way of God where they
shall never know peace for their immortal souls, but they who dwell in the
everlasting light truly fearing his dreadful name and evermore trembling in
his pure presence at the word of his Power who is God, blessed for ever more
Amen, Even they and none but they shall sing the song of Moses and the Lamb
for evermore, for they only are found worthy, worthy, worthy, to sit upon the
Throne Judging and ruling amongst the twelve Tribes of Israel for ever more who
has been and ever shall be taught by the Lord, and have learned the pure
Language from his own Mouth and speaks no other words then he has taught you,
even you are the pure virgins indeed who must always dwell with the Lamb in
the presence of his Grace singing praises and sounding fourth Hallelujah's to
him that sits upon the Throne, who was slain by our sins but is now become our
eternal Resurrection who only is worthy to receive of all his blessed number
power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing,
World without end, Amen.

So all dear Lambs dwell with the Lord, that you may at all times walk with him
in the deeps where you may evermore behold his Glory, that so in his living
presence ye may be refreshed in all times of need, even eating of the living
bread when ye hunger and Drinking of the pure Fountain when you are athurst
that so all may be wholly satisfied and none to go forth but that all may dwell
within where your strength is that is able to support you now and for evermore.
That so great may be your unity in the pure spirit that in unfeigned love and
holy fellowship, your hears minds souls and spirits may be lincked Joined and
united together in one bond in the band of Peace and in the Covenant of Life
never to be separated from the presence of the living God nor one from another
so in patience possess ye your own hearts and dwell together in the meek seed
of life where in the deeps you may feel the inocent life of your dear suffering
brother.

A Word to the Transgresser
O All Mighty, all Powerful, God of Power of Heaven and Earth who in the
Majesty of thy Power and strength of thine Almightiness, art risen by the
strength of thine Arm to plead with all that are backsliding in Israel and in
this Cause wherein thou have been provoked by a backsliding People, whom thou
by a mighty hand and outstretched arm have brought out of the Land of Darkness
and from the house of Bondage, who have again Provoked thee: Even in the
Wilderness and also in the good Land: And now although Moses and Samuel should
stand before thee: and although thy Righteous Servants should petition to thee
never so much yet thou will not hear as concerning this thing whereby thou have
been provoked, neither will thou be entreated by us, but certainly thou will
arise and plead strongly with them all because they have so grieved thy good
spirit in so often provoking and sinning against thee. Yet O holy righteous
father thy own blessed suffering seed is very tender and I know it is very
Precious in thy sight, O our Dear Father, and is not its inocent tender
babelike cry in the meekness of thine own spirit aloud unto thee O spare dear
Lord, O spare thy People for blessed Abraham, thy servants sake, and for the
sake of the seed of thy Covenant with whom and to whom all thy Promises are as
yea and amen for evermore, oh remember, Dear Lord remember and keep not thine
Anger for ever. oh let it be but in thy fatherly pity a tender gentle
Chastisement to draw them nearer to thee then ever, that so they may have great
cause to bless and honor thy great name now and for evermore Amen.

And as I was thus in my Measure very quiet and very still innocently in peace
and in joy with my Maker he showed me Concerning thee O Israel that some within
thy Borders had caused and do yet cause thee to err, the effects of which
cause will and shall bring sad tediousness to them in thee O Israel who have
so highly offended the righteous pure unchangable God; in minding poor
changable man beyond what he is or ever was or ever shall be while he is here
in this body, I tell thee O Israel that which has been seen concerning this
matter has so highly provoked God that he will not easily be reconciled to
them in thee who have thus offended, nay nay but for this offense thou must be
Chastized and Greatly afflicted and now in this day have ye not throne down one
and set up another, and is there not now a very great cause given unto us to
bear in remembrance at all times the words of our Blessed Lord and Savior
Jesus Christ concerning that evil slothful servant, but if that evil
slothful servant shall say in his heart my Lord delaieth his coming and shall
begin to smite his fellow servants and to eat and drink with the drunken, the
Lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looks not for him, and in an
hour that he is not ware of: Oh consider this all you that have stolen a side
from the deep sense and from feeling of your first love wherein there was no
evil neither any Guile, that so with speed you may return and receive him as
in the beginning that so love unfeigned may spring up in your hearts and life
and virtue abound in you that ye may be Grafted into the true Vine to receive
of its pure sap and virtue before you are wholly cut off as dry and fruitless
withered branches, O Remember this every on that has forgoten God, and with
speed return least he arise in his Mighty power and Cut you asunder and appoint
you your portion with hypocrites there shall be weeping and wailing Gnashing of
teeth, and as the days of Noah was so shall the coming of the son of man be.

Friends it is sealed in my heart by the Eternal spirit of the Lord.

These be the days he spoke of, and are not many now to the great Grief of
the pure spirit, Marrying and given in Marriage not being moved of the Lord, and
is not the Ark of God prepared and preparing, and is there safty any where
else save only in the Arc and should not all make have thither, Namely into
the Ark of God before the flood over take you which I can assure you all, is
very near O let every one that reads understand, and is not the righteous
life of Noah now Preaching to all while the Ark of God is preparing that are
Making merry, Namely eating and drinking Marrying and giving in Marriage,
bulding Planting and inhabiting as though the day of the Lord should never over
take you being out of the fear of the Lord and dread and awe of his holy Name,
alas, alas, how many have been sporting themselves against the faithful
Ministers and true messengers of God, who have often told you in tears and in
deep lamentations such a day would assuredly overtake many and how faithful
have they been in Laying it before you and Charging it upon you to watch
always, and pray continually, least you enter into temptation but oh how have
you slighted them and have not many amongst you in your own Immaginations
Judged one and Condemned another whom God has Eternally sealed in the
Everlasting Covenant of life and peace for ever more: and are you still indeed
so blind to think that the Lords eye is not open beholding these things yes
verily he takes true and perfect notice of them all and his blessedness is
vexed there with and his good spirit is grieved and the holy seed is greatly
oppressed Even as a cart is pressed with sheaves, and now there is heard a deep
and Lamentable morunfull cry sounded in the Ears of its tender Father because
of these things.

Oh my burden, my burden, my grief, my grief, my lamentation, my
lamentation, my sorrow, my sorrow, my Mourning, my Mourning, yea my very soul
dwells in heaviness and I am even bowed down down down, my tears are many my
sighs are very deep my Groans are very heavy my travel is in the depths of
sorrow, concerning thee, O thou beloved City part of whose walls are broken
down yea and verily the Enemy shall and will be suffered to pray upon thee
because of the great Iniquity that is found amonst many in thee. Oh gird on
sackcloath and sit in ashes ye carlesse daughters that are therein, and morun
and weep yea wail and lament that so the Lord in mercy may yet return and for
his own blessed name sake and the seed of his covenant have mercy upon you and
show kindness to you before the day of your tender visitation be wholly past
away.

THis is given fourth in the pure Life of Virginity and in Love unfeigned that
thinks no evil wherein there is no Guil, but is without fault before the
Throne of the Lamb for ever more through a broken heart in tender loving Issues
streaming from the Fountain of Life through the Deep travels of my wearried
soul to the holy crying breathing seed in the Living commandment of the
Almighty powerful God of all Wisdom life and virtue that fills heaven and
Earth.

To be read in the fear of the Lord amongst all the Congregations and
Assemblies of the people of God called Quakers.
