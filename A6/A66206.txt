By the King, A PROCLAMATION For a Public Thanksgiving.
WILLIAM R.

WHereas it has pleased Almighty God in His great Goodness to put an end to
the late War, in which His Majesty and His Allies were Engaged against the
French King, by the Conclusion of Peace between His Majesty and the Princes and
States in Confederacy with Him and the said French King, upon such a Foundation
as, by the Blessing of God, may prove effectual to procure a Firm and Lasting
Tranquillity to Europe: His Majesty therefore adoring the Divine Goodness, and
duly considering that such great and public Blessings do call for public and
solemn Acknowledgments, has thought fit (by the Advice of His Privy Council)
to Issue this His Royal Proclamation, hereby Appointing and Commanding that a
General Thanksgiving to Almighty God, for these His Mercies, be Observed
throughout this Kingdom of England, Dominion of Wales, and Town of Berwick upon
Tweed, on Thursday the Second Day of December next. And for the better and more
orderly Solemnizing the same, We have given Directions to the most Reverend the
Archbishops and Right Reverend the Bishops of this Kingdom, to Compose a Form
of Prayer suitable to this Occasion, to be Used in all Churches and Chapels and
other Places of Public Worship and t^ take Care for the timely Dispersing of
the same throughout their respective Dioceses. And We do strictly Charge and
Command that the said Public Day of Thanksgiving be Religiously Observed by
all our Loving Subjects as they tender the Favor of Almighty God, and upon
Pain of suffering such Punishment, as We can justly Inflict upon all such who
shall Contemn or Neglect the same.

Given at Our Court at Kensington the Seventeenth Day of November, 1697. In the
Ninth Year of Our Reign.
