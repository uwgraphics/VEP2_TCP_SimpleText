The letters which Johan Ashwell Priour of Newnham Abbey besides Bedforde,
sent secretly to the Byshope of Lyncolne, in the year of our Lord M. D.
xxvii. Where in the said pryour accuses George Joy that time being fellow of
Peter college in Cambrydge, of four opinyons: with the answer of the said
George un to the same opynyons.

Every man that does evil, hates the light: and comethe not to the light,
that his dedas should not be reproved. Johan. iii.
The first opinion is (as M. priour says) that a simple preyst has as large
and as great power to bind and to lose, as has a byshop^, or the byshope of
Rome. The second that he imputes unto me is that faith is sufficient without
works. The third that he fayneth on me, is that every priest may have a wife
or a concubine. The fowerth, that every lay man may hear confessions., v.
And because he says that I had men going on pylgrimage in de^is^on, I have set
to the scripture that dampneth worshippyng of images.
Tandem vincat veritas.
Qui operit odium suum fraudulenter: reualabitur malicia ei^s in cetu.
Prouerbi. 26.

He that kouere^h his hatered to hurt another: his malice shall be openly
declared.

Qui voluit l^pidem: reuer^etur ad eum. Prouerbi. x^vi. He that rolleth a stone
shall have it rolleth him again.
At last the truth will have the vyctorye, Here follows the pryours letters
taken out of his own hand word for word.
The superscription. To our most Reverend father in Christ and special good
lord my lord of Lyncolne our diocesan be this delivered with speed.
MOst Reverend father in god dew reco^mendations had to you with humble
obedience: I your spiritual child, loving subget, and daily bedaman is glad
to here of your prosperous welfare, ye which I and my brethern daily pray to
god to continue. And where as your lordship wro te your loving letters
willing them to be kept secret: so I beseech your lordshyp, that these
simple letters of mine may be kept secret unto your self. Also where as my
Lord your suffragane informed your lordship one master Joy by y^ know ledge
that he had of me what erroneus opynyons he hylde: forso the some be out of my
mind, and some I have called to my mind by the reason of your letters. ^^a
opin^o erat quam ipse tenebat, quam ta^ta et tam larga potestas ligandi atque
soluendi erat data a deo simplici sacerdoti, quan^a episcopo vel Romano

Se^unda opinio, an fides sine operibus sufficit Ipse tenebat quam sic. Et ego
teneba^ contra, quia di^us Iacobus apos^olus ait, quam fides sin: operibus
mortua est* Et sic pro and contra inter nos. Sed tamen in conclusion^ sua ipse
concessit quam opera fidei subintelliguntur in vera fide and perfecta, and sic
co^clusionem f^ciebat quam sola fides sufficit.

^er^ia opinio, quam quilibet sacerdos potest habere vrore^ v^l concubina^: et
posuit exemplum in beato Petro, qui hab* bat vrore^ ante vocatione^ and post
vocationem. Sed frater m^us celer^rius tenebat quam non vtebatur vxore sua post

More over I have hard sum report^ yt when he have been among lay persons at
festis or yo^keres in the country he has had many lewd opinions among the
people and some good folkys would murmer and grugge at his saynges and some
would rejoice therein.

The answer of George Joy or gye as he calls him.
MAster priour, I marvel greatly, considering: the great kindenes and love that
you ever pretended toward me never openyng your grefe and mind to me so often
resorti^g to your place, never moneshi^g me (although you say y^ you exhorted
me openly and secretly, which is not true) y^ you ne uer made any insinuatio^
unto me of this your preuey odiouse ente^te, but rather showed me outward ly a
faier flatering co^tenau^ce desieri^g me often to abide with you: but (as I now
perceive) al was to ho^te out somewhat of me whereby you might thus Ind ^ily
betraye me, and so do your spiritual father and other, such a secret
sacrifice. Surely I had ne uer believed although it was told me of many that
you had thus accused me, had I not seen your own hand: which letters I would
have wynited at as I do yet at other menn^s false reports on me, if I had been
but gyltye al things (as I am not) which you do impute unto me then I would
have let your letters lie still in darkness after your desyer: Or if they had been but only harmfull unto my boby and name which I am bound to defend: yet I
would have suffered s^f^e silence ^ pacyeno to have been my patrones and defe^ders
before god, never to have answered you, co^fortig my self in my god the God of
al comfort, now expulset my native land through your letters lesing my poor
living, forsaki^g al my ki^ne and fre^des, being in great pouertye and kare in
the which al you have set me for that I would avoid the cruel tyranny of your
spiritual father and of other incenste by your letters. I would (I say) have
conforted my self and do daily as god gives me grace with this one
comfortable saying of my savior Mat. 5. Blessed are you when me^ cast rebukes
and sclaunderouse reuilinges upon you, persecuting you and report al manner of
evil against you, belying you for my sake: Rejoice and be glade for great is
your reward in heaven. This one sentence is enough to answer for me ^ to
comfort me against al slanders and false reports, and even against your
letters as touching my person and fame. But in that your letters and opinions
are sclaunderouse and blasphe mouse against god and his truth, I may not suffer
them to be hedde in darkness as you desired your most reverend father to keep
them. Wherefore I shall by gods grace avenge and deliver his truth from your
false opinions, and that by his true word that yet if thus, it would please god
to open your eyes and show you his truth and call you to repentance First you
say that one opinion was that I held, that as great and as large power to bynd
and to lose was given of god to a simple preyst as to a bishop or to the
byshope of Rome (which is more. Which intent and opinion (you say (I proved by
these words of Christ saing. Go your ways in to the world and preach the
Gospel. etc. For as my father has sent me, so send I you. etc. Sir, first ye
shall know that what so ever the scripture affyrmeth, I hold it for no
opinion: but I believe it to be true for there ie great dyfference between faith
and opinion And as for these textes which you say that I alleged to prove my
intent, look you whether they make for your opinion of byndinge and losing in
secret confession after your understanding, or rather to pertayne to the open
preaching of the ^ orde of God. And turn to Mark in the. 19, chap. and look
whether this your text. Quia sicut misit me pater. etc. follows (as you alleg
it) ^te in mundum vniuersum with a conjunction causale as you falsely bring it
in to show the cause of the sente^^e be fore. But turn to Johan cap. 20. and
there shall you se it stand without a Quia as a proposition first propounded
of Christ in a comparison or similitude and afterward there disposed, the
comparison declared both in the geuinge of the holy ghost and power to forgive
and to hold sins Nether did ^ allege these textes as you do at rouers so
confusely confoun dynge one Euangelyste with another to confute your false
opinyon, not yet added I any sc^liret in plurali numero, for Solomon warns
Prouerbi orum. 30. that we add nothing to gods word lest we be reproved
and found liars. And Christ spoke his vordes in the plural number at the
geuyng of his keys to all his apostles: as ye may se Ioh. 20 without any
scil^cet, if you know a verb of the plural noumber from the singular. But I
pass over your ignorance, and shall prepare me to confirm the truth into the
co^futation of your false opinions, of the which. The first is that a bishope
or the byshope of Rome (by who^ you understand the Pope) has a greater and
larger power to bind and to lose given them of god then a simple preiste. That
the truth of gods word might be delivered from your false opinions and
losed from your vyolente wrestynge of holy scripture: and that it appears
verily by your opinion, that you know not what Christ meant by the keys of
the kingdom of heaven, nether yet what is understand by binning and losyng:
ye shall know that when Christ asked his disciples. Mat. 16. Who^ say you that
I am? peter (as the mouth of the^ al) answered that thing which they all
believed: eue^ thus. Thou art Christ the son of the living god. That they al
believed thus as Peter openly confessed, the terte folowinge declares. For eu^
incontenently he warned not only Peter, but all them who^ he asked the question
that they should not tell any man that he was Jesus christ This, Johan declares
in the. 6. chapter. Where Christ asked his disciples. And will you go away to?
Peter answered as the mouth for them all. Lord, to whom shall we go? thou
haste the wordis of euerlastige life, and we believe (he said not I believe
alone) and know that thou art Christ the son of the living god. Here
Peter answered for the^ all the same thing that he confessed. Mat. 16. upon this
therefore so faithful a knowledge and belief sen^ in the^ al he promised the^.
Mat. 16. the keys of the kigdom of heaven, for where he saw like a faith there
would he give like office: And as Bede says in the Homelte of the same text.
When all were asked in ge nerall. Peter alone for all answered, so that the same
thing that Christ answered Peter, answered to them all in Peter, sayng:
Blessed art thou Simon bariona. etc And to the shall I give the keys of the
king do^e of heaven that what so ever thou shall lose in the earth it shall be
losed in heaven: And what so ever thou shall bind in earth, i^ shall be bound
in heaven. That he promised the^ all, these keys it is manifest in the
performinge of them. John. 20. ^a. Where it is told when these keys here
promised were given, to who^ they were given, and what he meant by them mark in
the. 16. and Luk in the 24* both to telling the same story. They were given
the same day that Christ rose from death at the eauenyng, the discyples
gathered together in an house for fear, the doors shyt to the^ unto whom
Christ entered in salutyng them sayng: Peace be with you But first let us se
what Christ me^t by these keys your opinion is that these keys ar the
autorite or power whereby Pope bishope or priest holds and absolueth the man
that confesses him into their ears, and of this power only (I dare say) you
understand your opynion, and so accused me as adversary to it. But Master
priour you shall understand that I mean no such power by these keys ne there
Christ means any such by them For when he gave them these keys: he sent them
not forth with them to hear confessyons, but to preach his gospel, as
witnesses both Johan, 20. and Mark, 16 so that these keys are annered unto
the ^ffyce of preaching as ye may see at the geuynge of them. But if ye were
well aquaynted with Christis gospel, ye should have read year this in Matthew
the 23. chapter. Woo be to you scribes and ^ariseis hypocrites for you shyt up
the kingdom of heaven before me^. etc. How (I pray you) did the^ s^i^ it up?
Luk declares. cap II. sayng woe be to you lawyers for you have taken away the
keye of knowledge, so that nether your selves enter in, and yet forbid you the^
that would enter in. Now thanked be god which has here told us at the last
what he me^te by his keys calling the^ the keys of knowleg: but I pray you
how d^d the pharysays and lawiers shyt up the kingdom of heaven? verily (even
as Luke says) in that they took away the keye of knowleg whereby men should
come thither, as now do their successors forbyddynge men to preach Christ's
Gospel, and to read his holy testament which is the very keye of the
knowledge of God our father and of Christ his son to be our only savior:
this is the keye that opens the high way so the byngdome of heaven, this
opens the door of the which Christ speakethe Johan. 10. through the^ which
door who so ever enters shall be ^aued etc. And for this cause Christ called his
gospel and holy word the keye of knowledge or keys in the plural nou^ber of
the kingdom of heaven alluding unto the double propertye that one keye has
both to open and shytte. Now s^th the shitting up of the kingdom of heaven by
the taking away of the keye of the knowledge of gods word: then must the
opening of it needs be the geuynge of the keye of the knowledge of Gods
word. Which knowleg stands in the preaching hearing and reading thereof,
wherefore Christ said at the delyueraunce of these keys Mark the. 16. Go
your ways into all the world and pr^a^he my gospel. And Johan cap. 20. As my
father had sent me so send I you. Here may you se what Christ meant by these
keys promised Math. 16. and when they were given, Luke tellyng the same storye
more at large ^ayenge: Thus it behooved Christ to suffer as it is written and to
rise again the third day from death, that repe^taun ^s and remission of sins
should be preached in his name among all nacyons. For at the preaching of the
law, men know their sins, and feale them self bounden, of the which know^eg
and f^ling there follows repentance. And at the preaching of the Gospel which
promyseth remyssio^ of sins there follows faith which loses the capture
co^s^yence in to the quiet lyber^ye of the spirit. Now had they the word
delivered the^ to be preached which he called the keye of knowledge, ^ow were
they inspyred with the holy ghost, now was the keye of Dauyd given them that
opens and no man shytt^th. ^po. 3. for after long communication and
declaring him self to them he said these are the words which I spoke to you
while I was yet with you: for all must be fulfilled which were written of me
in the law of Moses, in the prophets and psalms. The^ open ned he their
hearts that they mygh understand the scryptures, the propertye of a keye is to
open that which before was shyt, thus, does Luke allude and agree his speech
with the propertyes of a keye, for before in the journey to Emaus with the two
disciples he says their eyes were shyt up and h^lde^ so that they knew him
not, but after he had rebuked them for their vnbelyefe and opened the^ the
scryptures turnyng the keye of his word in their hearts, the holy ghost working
with all, their eyes were opened and they knew him. Here may ye se in the story
of Luke how with his word he opened the hertes of these two disciples yet
locked up in unbelief before they, returned to Hi^rusale^ unto the other xi
disciples. Now says he, even as ^ was sent, that is to say, to open men's
hearts lesing them with the keye of my knowledge from vnbelyefe by preaching and
erpoundyng the scriptures, even so send I you, he sent not only them but
has sent hitherto and shall send preachers with the same key^ es of
knowledge of the word to bind and to lose like wise unto the worlds end.
Note here also how often Luke uses these words, their eyes were holde^, their
eyes were opened, he oponed their wit tes ever more alludynge unto the
propertye of a keye. Thus he opened their hearts with the keye of his word to
bring in his knowledge in to the^, the holy ghost breathed into them and
turning the kaye in their hearts into the right sense and under standing of his
word, An example is set to in John of Thomas Dydimus which was not among
thappostles at the geu^g of these keys of y^ know lege of his gloriouse
resurrection which was that Gospel and the very joyful tiding^s: wherefore his
heart was yet locked up and holden in vnbelyefe: not wythstandynge yet the
other apostles did put this keye into him and so began to practice it upon him
saying. ^idimus d^im: but this keye turned not right in his heart ne opened
it, for he believed the^ not but said: Except I se the holes of the nails in
his ha^ des and put my finger into them, ye except I put my hand into his
side, I will not believe it. (Here was Thomas sore bounde^ and holde^ with the
sin of un belief) But after. viii. days, they being there within again and
Thomas with them, Jesus came in, the door shyt and stood among them saying:
peace be with you: and the^ said he to Thomas: put in thy finger here and feel my
hands, put up thy hand and thruste it into my side, and be no more in unbelief
but believe. Here the keye of christ's word turned right in Tho mas his heart
losinge it from vnbelyefe, and he said D^s meus et deus meus, my Lord and my
god. The word of god conteyneth both the law and the Gospel. The law is that
which god commands us to fulfill, as are the. x. commandments, the gospel
is the power of god unto health for every man that believes. To. i. and it is
the promise of grace and remission of sins given us through Christ. The law is
spiritual and requires our hertes and our very effects: as to believe and to
trust in God only to love him with all our hearts, soul, and m^de above al
things. Here the law showed us our sins and of what sinful nature we are
that ca^ not fulfill these commandments: here it works wrath, it fears
and so vexes our co^scie^ces at the knowleg of our sins that we begin n^ to
be angry with gods judgment wrykyng in us (such is the weakness of our sinful
nature) ye and we in a manner despeyer: thus the law working her power and
office in us, sin is increased, and we are led captyue and bound under the
law of sin which is in our members* Roma. vii. For the law is the power of
sin. i. Corin. xv. At these offices and use of the law preached or read, a
sinful consciences felith her self bounden and holde^ under the power of
sin and karyed toward dampnation as Paul declares in his pistle to y^
Romans, there he expressing the nature and stre^ght of the law, as every
sinner touched of God may feale verily in his own heart at his conversion. But
w^e^ the gospel comes which is that joyful tidi^ges, that christ came to call
and to save sinners, and that grace and forgeue^es of sins is given through
his death to as many as believe this comfortable promise: the^ the sinner
heari^g these tidi^ges and believing the^ perfitly: fealeth his heart eased,
conforted and losed. But if he believes it not: the^ is he yet holde^ still
bou^de^ in to da^p nation: this is the byndyng and losyng of the keys of gods
word. This expressed he bretely in Mark say inge. He that believes and is
baptized shall be saved, and he that believes not shall be da^^ned* and Ioha^ on
this manner said: whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven the^: and
whose you shall hold, they are holde^* Also another manner of bindig and losyng
by these keys, the scripture rem^breth in the. 18. ca. of Mat which place
shows us how the virtue of exco^mu nication or seperating of obstinate
impen^tent and open sinners out of the co^grega^yon should be used First the
sinner ought to be rebuked of his brother wh^ he had offended, and then if he
will not hear him to ^e monished before one or two witnesses, and yet if he
hear them not to be complained of unto the holy congregati^. Who^ if he yet will
not hear / the to be separated from^ the feloshyp of the faithful. This
co^municatio^ o^ putting out of the congregation Christ called in the said
place of Matthew a bynding: and the reconsiling of the same person (if ^^ be
penitent after this) is there called a ^osynge. W^er ^pp^ he said unto his
disciples on this ma ^^^. If this obstinat man will not hear the congre gation
(...) (...) be to you as an heithen and publica ^^, that ^^ to say, as an
infydele excluded out of (...)s company. For verily I say unto you, (...) so
ever ye bynd upon the earth they shall be (...) ^^ heaven, and what so ever you
lose on the ^r^^ they shall be losed in heaven, that ie to say, whom so ever you
put out of the congregatyon he re, aft^r this form prescrybed you, the ^ame
thing is confyrmed in heaven: and whom you receive aga^^g as penytent and
sorye for his offenses the same is rec^^ued in heaven. This manner of byndyng and
losyng Paul put in execution once upon the open sinners as ^e may read in the.
v. ^ap of the first to the Corin. there bynding and holding in him in his sin
as an obstynat, op^n, vnshametaced sinner now put out of the holy company, and
after his great heaviness and repentance losed him again reco^cyled and
restored unto the congregation: as it is written in the. ii. Corin* cap. ii. Now
compare the form and cause of Paul's execu^yng of this manner of
exco^municatio^ and absoluyng again unto our bishops lighteninges and
thondringes of their exco^municatyons and hursynges, and lok^ how they agree
with Christ's word and Paul's form in all circumstances.

But as for the keys which are the law and Gospel preached or read, for that
the one binds and the other losethe the beleuers from sin and
condempnatio^: it needs not to dispute whether the po pe has more power to
lose with prechyng thereof then a bishop, or a bishop greater then a simple
priest. For the Popes high holiness may not desce^de to so vile a law an office
although he were learned, and the^ bishops busynes may not attend to excute
thoffyce and power of edyfyyng they are so full occupied in destroing, the
simple sir Iaha^ is not now learned and yet if he were learned, he must have
their autorite which is hard to be obtained if he will preach the truth Peter
and Paul were but pore simple prestes in comparison to our holy father the
Pope, to the most reverend Cardinales graces, and to our lords the
bishops, and ye^ I think they had as great and as large (as you say) power
to lose and to bind with prechinge the word of God as has Pope, cardinal,
bishope, abbote, or p^^our And as for the scripture, it puts no such
difference of lordely po^^rs, nether knows ^^ such lordely and ^^ought names:
but says to the^, though the heathen play, the Lords, yet shall not you be
so, it ^ayth not you shall be so: but vos aut^ non si^. But set men to look
whether it be truly translated into English that while they are in co^f^^^yng
on text with another lokyng na(...)e for fa^tes in the translatyo^ where no^
was (...)a^tes and abhominatio^ might be balked or y^ less espied: but had
they left hontynge for errors in the translatyon and conferryng text to
text, and compared your living ^o the gospel, they had seen them agree to
gyther as darkness with light, and the deuel with with Christ. More over the
scripture knows no such dyfference as you suppose between Pope, bishop and
priest but calls a pre^h a bishop and a ^yshop a pressed if ye english these
two words pres byter and Episcopus after the comen English as ye may ^ede.
Act. 20. and. i. ad Titum. And as for this name Pope or the ouermost bishop, I
find them not but that there were certain called the chief or principal of
the preistes unto whom Judas went saing: what will you give me and I shall
betraye him and deliver him into your hands, as you had went to have
delivered me by your secret false lettters of the which chief prestes it is
written also Math. 27 that they called a counsel erly with the elders of the
people against Jesus to deliver and to put hi to death. Now (I trust) ^. priour,
you se how y^ law preached binds, and the gospel loses and how christ put
the keys of his gospel in to the hates of his dysciples ouce locked up in
unbelief and ignorance, and how happily he turned them opennynge their
hearts into the knowledge of him now risen by the power of his spirit,
preaching and interpretin ge them the law and the prophets ^osing their ^oit
tes and openyng their eyes. And even so do the preachers of gods word daily
that are sent and inspyred with his spiryt (all though they be but simple
preistes in your eyes and nether pope nor by shope) occupy their minds in his
law day and* night and exer cise these keys besely turnyng the^ in men's
hearts whetting the word of god upon them and, as Paul exhorts his Timothe
preaching his word, are fervent in a ceason or out of ceason, improve rebuke,
exhort with a^ long sufferige, 2. Timo. 4 These men I say that thus preach
and teach ^^^ ^inually gods word and declare it purelye have ^hr^keyes of
the kingdom of heaven, these lose when they o^e^ sinners hearts into
repentance and faith they bind when they preach the law and hold styl^ such
as believe not their words but resyst and persecute them. And you, M, priour
and as many as ne there can nor will preach but persecute them that God
^endeth with these keys: you (I say) whethe^ ye be Pope, Cardinal, bishop,
abbot, pryou^ or pre^s^e, neither loose nor bind, nor yet have you Christ's
keys but only those rustye traditions and laws of men to shut up the
kingdom of heaven, ^ to take away the knowledge of Christ with ungodly
inibicions, lightenynges and thunderynge of exco^manicacions, threateninges,
persecucions, impresonynges, scourgynges, and burnynges, nothin ge fering that
terryble thonder ^clappe of Christ's own mouth daily thondrynge over your
heads. cryeng Mat. xxiii. Woe be to you scrybes and Phari ^e^s hipocrites, for
you shyt up the kigdome of heaven before men, and neither your self enteri^,
nor yet suffer you such as would come thereto to enteri^ And yet fear you not
this terrible threatenige of ever lasting da^nacion hanging over your heads.
These are your counterfetted kei^s and false peste lent persuasions to drive
the people from the knowledge of Gods word and their salvation, which word
is the key and high way to the kingdom of heaven, ye say it is hard and
derke* for the lay people / but woe be to you says I say ca. v. that tell the^
the light to be darkness* you say that the scripture in English would make
sedition, bread errors and heresies among the lay men and so to be evil for
the^: but woe be to you says I say that say that the ^e which is good to be
evil, ye say the letter slays the, is unsavory and bitter for them, but woe
be to you says I say again that say y^ which is sweet to be bitter. Thus is
the holy, ^lear^ good and sweet gospel of Christ belyed shamefully and
blasphemed of you. If it be bitter unsavory, it is an evil savor, it is
koucred and dark to you that pe ry she says Paul. 2. Corin. 2. and. 4. It
had been beter for you to have obeyed the counsel of Gamaliel. Act. 5. then
thus so manyfestly repugned and faughte against god: but you ar so blinded with
your own malice that you ^e not how sith you inhibyted the preachers, and the
word of God to be ^aught and read of the lay men, and persecu^ed it, the
more it enc^eseth, it grows, it spreads, it thrusts you down and
declarh^h you openly to be the very Pha risaes, scribes, hipocrites, and eue^
the very Antichrists, that Christ and his apostles prophesied to come in the
last days. Repent, repent you therefore and ^e converted to God, ask grace
and mercy, that he will illumyne your hearts ^ lose you with the keys of the
knowledge of his holy word, and unlock your wits out of this blind
ignorance and vnbelyefe. Amen.

But yet sir, if your learni^g be so increased since the time that you chased me
away wi^h these your letters, that you can make me this obiectyon, taken of
Mark in the second chapter and Luk in the 5. that ^t is only god that
forgeueth sins: and so the Apostles forgive the^ not. The^ I answer you that
there ar many things pertaining only to god which be of his infinite goodness
gives unto us and calls the^ ours. The keys which are the word ^^ his, and
yet he calls the word ours and many things that were wrought with the same
worcester de, as in mat 10. where he said to the apostles. He ha^^e y^ sik, make
clean the leprose, raise y^ deed, castout deuels, which al were his works and
yet he gave then power to do his works. The word where with they did these
miracles, was his word, and yet he called it theyrs, sayng. Who so ever
receive not you, another will hear your words, etc, ye and even our own good
works (as we believe) it is he that works them in us, as testifies Isai^
the. 26 and yet is he conte^te of his liberality that we bare the name of
them, and be called our works. but he rewards his deades in us says
Augustine. Y^ this solutio^ satisfies you not, then remitte I you unto like
manner of speech, a ^eremye. 15. Where God bad Jeremy cast out the Jews
from his presens, saing: Eiice illos a facie mea. And yet god ^asted them out
his own self, and even so in like autorite he said to the Apostles: Whose
sins so ever you forgive, they are forgiven. etc. For after the familiare
phrase and v^hemence of the Hebrewe speech (as the professors of that tongue
affirm) When god ^ad Jeremy ^aste them forth: he would nothing else but that he
should tell and preach the^ to be cast forth and led in captyuite if they
amended not their living, so when he said to thapostles. Whose sins so ever
you forgive. etc. He meant that to whom so ever you preach and tell the^ their
sins to be forgeuen, if they believe in me ^ change their life, their sins
are fongeuen. For ^s at Ieremies preachinge the ungodly were castoute, so at
Thapostles preaching the penytent beleuers have their sins forgeuen. And the
unbelievers are holden captyue in their sins.

M. Priour of New^hams second opinion
NOw as touching your second opynion, which you say that I held: That faith
with out works is sufficient, verily I never said so: but I might say that by
faith without works a man is justified, which is Paul's saying in the third
cap. to the Romans, and this sentence I believe as ^^ we with Paul, and hold it
for no^ opynion. And for a declaration of this Paul's sentence I will first
tell you what is faith, what it is to be justified before god, and what is the
ryghwysenes of faith First ye shall know that the apostle defines faith in
the* 11* ca. to the Hebrews saing that faith is the very sure and substanciall
belief of him which is the same thing that we hope for: that is to say faith
is an infal^ible and undoubted certaintye in our hearts, whereby we believe and
trust in the inuysible God: and to open this definition yet more plainly.
Faith is that same co^stante and fast persuasion in our hearts assured us by
the holy ghost, certifyeng us of the goodness of God and of his promises toward
us, by the which persuasion we believe verily his words and ar assured in our
hearts (the holy ghost testifyeng it in us) that he is our God, our father, to
us an almighty helper and delyuerer, and that we are received in to his favor
by the death and merits of his son Jesus Christ our savior, upon the which
belyefe and assured persuasio^ we love him so ernestly again that we cease not
(the occasyon and time offered) to fulfill his pleasures in doing the worker of
love or charity to our neighbors. Of this lively faith Paul speaks always,
which by love is mighty in open ration ad Gala 5. and mente no more dead faith
in this his sentence. A man is justified by faith, the^ he mente of a dead
man, when he alleged the prophet Abakuc saing, the rightwyse shall live of
his faith, for deed faith gives no life

To be iustyfyed or to be made ryghtwyse bfore God by this faith, is nothing
else but to be absol ued from sin of God, to be forgeuen, or to have no sin
imputed unto him of God.

The rightwisenes which is allowed before god that comes of faith is sometimes
in scripture call led his mercy or favor toward us and in us, where by he is
moved for Christ's bloudes sake to promise us forgeuenes. And sometimes it is
taken fo his truth and faythfulnes in the performyng of his promise, and of
this is he called just or ryghtwise, faith full and true. Wherefore the
scripture comenly joins these two words, mercy and truth or faith fulness
together especially in the psalms as I no ted in the argument of the 89.
Psalm, and as Da uid prays god in the. 31. psalm. to deliver him for his
ryghtwysnes sake: that is for his mercies sake or for his truths sake, and in
the. 5* Psalm lord led me forth for thy ryghtwysnes sake. The mercy whereby
god is moved to promise us his benefytes goes before, and his truth in
performynge follows, now the manner of the scryptures is, to use the one for
the the other, as the kingdom of heaven for the gospel which goth before and is
the knowleg of the way to the kingdom, and because of hearin ge the word,
comes faith. To. 10, therefore to hear in scripture is sometimes taken for to
believe, as John in the. 6. Every man that has hard and is learned of my
father comes to me, that is to say, every man that believes on the father. etc
and in the same ca. He that comes to me shall not ho^ger, whi che saing the
sentence following expounds thus, He that believes in me shall never thyrste or
shall be ever satysfied, here, to come to Christ which foloueth faith in him is
taken for ^o believe in him and sometime that at gothe before is taken for that
at follows, as may apeare well to them that are excercised in reading of holy
scripture, as the keye of knowledge and the gospel are all one, for that one
comes of the the other. Forthermore. Paul in the. ^ and. 19. ca. to the To. and
in the. 3 to the Phy^^. declares two manner of ryghtwysenes: one he calls the
rightwisenes of the law or our own rightwisnes, and the the other the rightwisnes
of god or of faith. The rightwisnes of the law is that at is gotten by works
of the law, the ryghtwysnes of faith is that whereby God of his mercy rekeneth
us ryghtwise for our fayhtes sake. Outward works show us rightwyse before the
world, but faith iustifyeth us before God, Abraham's vtwarde deed in obein ge
God and going forth to offer his son Isaac, Gene. 22. and James. 2. was a
testymonye of his faith, and declared him rightwyse before men, after the
rightwisnes of the law, but his faith justified him before god ^o^ge before ye^
Isaac was bor ne. Gene. 15. Also we are justified before God only in that we
are chosen in Christ before the world was created. Ephesians. 1. Of the which
election and justification, our faith when god gives it us, certyfyeth our
hearts, and afterward when our faith breketh forth in to good works (for trve
faith ca^ not be ydel) the^ are our works a testimony before me^ of our
foyth, so that our faith is a secret and a suere persuasion to our self of
our election before God, and our works that proceed of faith are a testimony
of our faith to the world, of the which outward works the world iugeth us
rightwyse after the rightwisnes of the law. But here let m^ take heed lest
they despise the rightwisnes of faith as heresy, and stand to the righwysnes
of their own works. Ot who^ thus speaks paul. ^o. 10. They are ignorant of
the rightwisnes which is allowed before god, and go about to stableshe their
own right wisnes: wherefore they are not under the ryghwisnes of God. There
Paul (as I poynted you to be fore) brings in Moses, Leuiti. 18. and in
Deutero. 30. describing these two rightwisnes, as one co^tra rye to the the other,
of the which description I will not here tarry, read the places and Paul's
pistle to the To. and to the Gala. and understand it if god will give it you.
This is therefore Paul's sentence to the Romans in the third chapter. We
suppose that a man is justified by faith without the works of the law,
understanding it of justification, and of that ryghtwisnes that is of lively
says and allowed before God, as I have declared it before. And for the
probatio^ of this sentence, the Prophets, christ his own fel^e, and his
Apostles spente all their labors and lives, and especially Paul labourynge
above all other to co^fyrme it, as it appears in his pistles, and especially
in his pistle to the Romans. Wherein he laid this sentence of the iustyfyinge
by faith, at the beginning as his principal proposition and chief foundation
grounded of the testimony of Abakuc the prophet. Against the which
proposition, the Jew which sought for the rightwisnes of works, as now do
the false Christen, a non objected saing, as you do now If faith only
justifies, wherefore then is the law with so many good works commanded us to
fulfill it? Paul answers. By the law come men into the knowled ge of their
syunes. And because ye should understand by the law he mente the moral law,
and not the ^eremonial. He gave ex^ple in the 7. ca. of y^ moral law saing. I
had not known y^ co^cupisce^se had b^ sin except the law had said. Thou
shall not lust And now therefore (says he Rom 3, (the rightwisnes of God is
made manifest with out the law by y^ Gospel from faith to faith which
rightwis nes was sometime preached of the Prophe^es and proved by the testimony
of the law, And now are men justified freely by Goddie mercy and by the re
demp^ion that is ^^ Jesus Christ through faith in his blood etc. R^^. Then again
obiecteth y^ Jews as now does the Christian / in the beginnige of the 4. ca,
What the^ shall we suye to Abraham our father after y^ f^ess^^: what got he by
his works? Was he not justified by them? If Abraham (says Paul) were
justified by his works / so has he whereof to rejoice / but not before God.
And even here is James question soluted Iaco, 2. sayng. Abraham our father* was
he not justified by his deeds when he would have offered his son Isaa^^yes
verily* as here says Paul he had to rejoice before men but not before God
that is to say he had that deed which justified him and declared him just
vtwardly before men with the rightwisnes of y^ law for his obedience: but as
concerning the rightwisnes of faith before God (says Paul (Abraham believed
in god and it was rekened him for rightwisnes. This is Paul's first argument
to prove his prin cipal proposicion which argument he takes of y^ example of
Abraham father of the people of God In whom the form of rightwismakinge was
first declared and set forth for our example, These ^onde argument Paul
deduceth of the diffinicio^ of this word Was Rekened: which stands in the
said autorite of Genesis. 15, and it signifies a rekeninge and a fre
forgeuenes of a duty which the detto^r is not able to pay sainge, To hi that
worcester keth is the reward not rekened of favor but of duty: And to him that
works not but bel^* neth on hi^ that justifies the ungodly. Faith is rekened
(for rightwisnes (faith says he and not worcester kes) even as David says, Blessed
is that man to whom the lord rekeneth not his sinn^ he said not blessed is he
that works but he to who^ God rekeneth not synnie that is to say although he
be a sinner and not able to come out of debt yet will not God of his mercy
reken it unto him ^e lay it to his charge for that the penitent sinner
believes that Christ made satisfaction for him and paid the ^aunsome for it
with his preciouse blood. And upon this fre forgeuenes be sealed him a
quita^nce with the seal of circumc^sion which was a toke^ to hi^ that he was
justified by his faith, But we ha ue now a more suer and liuelyer ^oken of our
right wismakinge by faith for god has confirmed us in Christ he has
anointed us he has co^segned us unto him and given us his holy ghost for an
erneste of his promise to be justified by faith, 2. Cor 1 and Ephe. 1, thus
sayng After that you hard the Gospel which is the word of truth wherein ye
believed ye were sealed with the holy spirit which is to us as an ernest penny
to be assurede of our pro mysed heretage, which is purchesed us by redemp cion
into the praise of the glory of God. Mo arguments Paul makes in the same*
4. cap. to the Romans, for the probation of his sentence, espy them out if
you can and desyer God to give you understanding. Also ye shall know that
Christ came not as a lawyer like Moses, but he was the very redemer and
reco^ciler of the beleuers through his blood into his fathers favor and
grace. The law was given by Moises, but remissyon of sins and the holy ghost
is given by Christ, Johan 1. ye and that unto all and upon all that believe.
To. 1 Oh what consolation is in this one place set forth for feared and
troubled consciences? surely no ^on ge can express it, for although we want
good works (as we want all, for there is not one that does good, for we are
all sinners) yet let us believe that for Christ's sake we are received freely
into our fathers grace. This ryghtwysnes is set forth of his mercy for us,
without the works of the law, wherefore surely, it were great blasphemye
against Christ, and no less defiling of his mercy seat, not to receive the
merits of his passion, that is to say, the ryghtwysnes by faith, but to turn
it into our sinful works. If any man (be he never so holy) should be
justified by his works then had Christ ^ayth Paul to the Gala. in the second
chapter dyed in vain for that same man: let us therefore receive Christ's
rightwisnes now offered us let us trust to his ryghtwisnes and merits and not
to our own, nor yet to any others, for all our rightwysnes says I say in the.
64. chapter are as the spotted and foul clothes of a me^strouse. It is verily
a great blasphemy to refuse this sure and fre forgeuenes in Christ's blood,
ye and a dampnable thing to repute it as heresye and to seek for works of our
own inuencion upon this hope and be lyefe to deserve heaven and to be justified
by them. For this article to be known Paul swet so sore in his pistles and
labored in his preaching, But yet let not blind carnal reason make this
obyectio^ against him sayng. If faith without works justifies, then need we
not to do any good works? Not so sir, for by faith therefore are we justified
to ^hentente we should do good works and never cease, and therefore Paul after
that he had suffycyently proved his conclusyon, did set to in the. 12. Chapter
to the Romans, mo good works the^ ever we are able to do, setting works in
their place, and faith in her place, for if the works are not ^one of faith,
then are they sin. Roma. 14.

Now master priour because you are not greatly acqueynted with Paul's doctrine,
although he be your patron and painted at your gates: because his arguments
ar to high for them that never felt faith, nor yet tasted the fealynge of the
spirit of faith in the schole of the cross. I will desce^d with you in a more
sensyble demonstratyon to prove Paul's sai^ges true and to da^pne your opinion.
Paul as he was going to persecute christ's church was smiten down a murderer
and rose again a justified man, which yet had done no good works, but only
believed in Jesus Christ that smyt him down and spoke unto him, ergo faith only
justified The young innocent now Chrystened and departed I think you will
grant is justified, but not by his works, ergo. The these that hanged by
Christ was justified upon the cross, but not for any works y^ he there did,
ergo for his faith only. Whersore sir, me think ye were to hastye to judge me
a Lutherane and an heretic for affyrminge or holdyng any saing of holy
scripture, which I know well you understand not, and to impute unto me that
which I never said, and so preuely to accuse me where upon to avoid the
cruel tyranny of my lord your reverent and spiritual father with his
adherentes that yet fight against the Lord and his anointed* I was constrained
to lose all that I had and to flee. Sir stand you to your glysterynge good
works and gloryouse meretes beleuynge to be justified and forgeuen for them
and not in christ's death, and trust you to them (if you will). For as for me
which am an heretic and a Lutherane in your opinyon, I shall by gods grace
fear with Iobe all* my deades, and pray with David. O lord I beseech the enter
not into judgment with thy servant, but save me and deliver me for thy
ryghtwysnes sake and not for mine, that is to say save me for thy mercies sake
and not for my merits. Also I shall by Gods grace after that mesure of the
faith that god has given me, believe to be saved in this faith, that is to
say, that my savior Christ has dyed for my sins, and is risen for my
ryghtwysmakynge b^ whose death and sufferinges, my father in h^ue^ is peased and
has received me into his favor for christ's bloudes sake, so y^ now christ
has redeemed me and saved me, he is mine, and al his mere^s are mine. His
ryghtwysnes, his wisdom his holiness* his satysfactyon, his fulfyllynge of the
law, and all his good deades ^r mine, as sufficient to serve me for my
salvation, and yet will I not cease to do good works, but rather am I bound
for this love to do more then ever I am able, thoghe I trust nether to my
nowne nor yet to any others. Thus have you a rekenyng of my faith as concerning
this article. Now to your. 3. opinion.

Master priour of Newnhams Third opinion.
YOur third opinion is, that I should hold that every priest may have a wife
or a concubine, Sir this may welbe your own opinion, for it was never mine I
take god to record y^ a priest might have a ^o^cubine, but this believe that it
is lawful and stands with holy scripture, that every priest which have not
the gift of chastity, ought to have his own wife, and no another man's nor yet
a concubine. Although your church milita^t (as you call it for they are better
soudiers then preachers) permits the prestes in some places to have their
concubines paynge their annuell tributes to their bishopes for their lecenciall
lust and in many places, to their great slander, their Co^missares, Scribes
with other officers wink at their horedome and adultery for bribes, for
favor, or fear. You told me once secretly as we walked after supper between
your barn yard and your high gates, that the Pope had dispensed with the
Cardinal to keep a concub^ne, which thing then (as little learning as I had) I
could not believe to be lawful, but that it had been rather lawful (for as
much as he had not the gift to live chastely if ye said true) to have married
and live in chaste ma trimony with his own wife. Nether believe I y^ your
church milytante did godly to inhibit priest or any woman to the holy and
honorable sacrament of matrimony, which God did institute for every man and
woman that would receive it, and denied it no man, as a sacrament that makes
lawful the act^ of wedlok, which committed without wedlok, is sin and
dampdable. You say that I took for my example saint Peter, which was a pressed,
and yet had he a wife, both before Christ called him to the office of an
apostle, and also after his calling Which example you can not deny. But then
brin ge you in for your help to confute my saying your brother celerer called,
Ioha^ Berde, or Johan Sal pho, a man of like learning and could beter skyl in
making of a pease r^ke then in alledgyng of holy scripture saying, that Peter
used not his wife aft^r his calling, and to prove this he allegged Paul in a
certain pistle (say you) for neth^r of you could tell where in what pistle nor
yet understood you your own allegatyon saying. They that have wives let the^ be
as though they had none. This text there fore ^aule wryt not to Peter onley and
to the other married apostles, but to the Corinthea^^, and to all vas that are
of Chhistes church ye to all the world, now if you understand this same Paul's
say^ ge in the. 7. ca. in the first to the Corintheans. They that have wives,
let the^ be as though they had none as your brother Celerer allegged it for
Peter, that is ^o say let them not use their wives, the^ after your minds,
ought no man that have a wife to have the feloshyp of his own wife. Here may
men se what clerkely dysputers ye are and what preu^e promotours and accusers
of Christen men your spiritual and most reverend fathers in God have procured
them. The text therefore is thus vnderstand^n, as the circumstance of the
letter declares it* let them that have wives be as though they had none, that
^s, let not their minds be so inordinatly drowned in lust and tangled with
kare for their household that they be hyndreth from preaching of the word, if
they be called thereto, or else be let from the hearing and following of the
word^ y^ they be otherwise called. By this text Paul e^tended nolesse to
forbydde amaryed man the chaste company of his wife and the due benevolence
(as he calls it in the same chapter) the^ the byer^ seller to not use his
goods lawfully, when he says in the text following. They that bye let them
be as though they possessed nothing, that is to say, let them not be so
gredelye glued to their goods, but that when they se occasyon they can be
content gladly to depart from them to releue the necessyte of the poor, and
for the declaration of this his mind he showed the cause why he thus said,
addyng thereto sayng thuo. For I would have you without to much ^are and
trouble. If Paul by this text should forbydde any man the company of his wife
(as you ^reamed) then should he say contrary to himself in the same chapter,
sayng. Let the man geu^ unto his wife the due benevolence, and let the wife
likewise unto her housva^d. But be it in case taht pe ter (as he did undoubted)
had the company of his wife after his calling. did he offend god in so doing
or no? If ye say that he offended, then blasphe^^ you and dishonor you the
sacrament of matrimony whereby god sanctified and made honorable the chaste use
thereof as Peter used it. If he did not of ^ende, why then ^yke you so sore for
Peter to defend him for well and lawfully doing? But here and ye were well
opposed you might be found to be in the heresy of the Ta^ia^s and like
heretekes that d^pned matrimony as vnpure, which god sa^ctifyed with his word,
and instituted as pure, holy, honorable and good, honoring it with his
prese^s and first miracle, forbydding it no man or woman that would marye. To
put you out of doubt of Peter's fellowship with other Apostles with their wives
after their calling: ye shall know that there were at the Corinthea^s certain
false prohhetes which observed Paul's living and the other apostles (as you
observed mine) to carpe their co^uersacion and to myneshe their auctorite, and
to defame the^ to the people sayng (as it appears by Paul's answer) that he
fasted not, nor was chaste, but led his wife about with him, unto who^ paul
answered sharply on this manner 1. Cor. 9. Have we not power to eat and to
drike? Other have we not power to l^ade about sister to wife as well as y^
other apostles and as the brotherne of the lord and as Cephas? Other only have
not I and B^rnabas power this to do? Here is it plain that C^phas which is
called Peter with other apostles led about their wives with them. who^ paul
after the manner of the scripture calls their sisters ^n^dyd ^^^aha^. G^n 11,
20. Isaac. 26. ^alomo^. Can. 4. for that they were of like faith and ^rofessio^
in Christ's religion with their housba^des. Why should not the man be
associated with his wife who^ god commands to forsake father andmother, and
to c^^ue to his wyf^* And Christ com maundeth also that who^ God joins let no
man separat? Think you that the Apostles regarded these commandments of god
so light as to leave their own wives one flesh and blood with the^ knyt to
gith^r with so fast a bond that only death must depart them? The wife says
paul. 1. Corrin. 7. has no power over her own body, but her housbande. and
likewise the man has no power over his own body, but the wife, withdraw not
you^ selves one from a another except it be with a common consent of both, and
that but for a time (he says not for ever both to go into relygion) but for a
time, to give your selves to fasting and prayer, and afterward come again
unto the same thing lest satan temp^e you for your incontine^cie. The apo
stles for a suer^y had cast matrimony in an higher r^u^rence and honor then
you think they had, and ^b^^rred it not as vnpure and profane as the
^orbydd^rs thereof do, and as did like heretics.

That a priest which have not the gift of chast^^ ought to have his own wife
it is manifest, by the Apostle 1. Cor. 7. sayng. ^ o auoyed fornication let
every man have his wife, here he excepted noma^, no not a priest (if a priest
be a man) let him have his wife (says he) and not a concubine or a another
man's wife, and let every woman have her housb^de* He ^rcepteth never No^ne
nor any other religiouse. But here you will say that they have vo wed chastity.
And I say it is chastity man and woman to live to gyther in chaste matrimony
desiryn ge no another. And if you say that they have vowed to live without the
desyer of the feloshype and company of man (for one to desyer a another in mind
is sin except they be man and wife) which you call vi^ ginal chastity: the^
say I again that they have vowed that thing that lies not in their power,
and so perform they it never. They that vow this chastity therefore let them
look before they leap. God at thy first creacion griffed into man and woman as
he has done into al creatures a certain secrets natural properte to begete,
to conceive, and to bring forth another ^n like kind and that lawfully with
honor. Which natural ordinance and prope^ ty it lies not in man to au^ter
and to change, nor yet to put away from his heart the natural love and d^syre
to the the other kind whom God created to be his fellow helper unto this natural
effect. No more then it lies in the lyber^ie of the lyuelye tree well planted
to cease from bringyng forth her fruits in her time, except God altered this
his natural ordinance by some singular gift. For it is another vow nor
mann^s tradition that may alter nature, But yet many have striued to put away
co^ cupiscens without matrymony and to obtain a gift of chastity by their own
works and enforce men's febleyng their bodies: but y^ more they striued
against nature, the less they prevailed, and the more burning they suffered:
and why? because they despised the remedy commanded by gods word to be
received, and went about to heal their decease with thyr own works and
inuencions. God ordined chaste matrimony as an holy and honest re medie for
this natural burning and unlawful lust, commanding by his Apostle. 1.
Corint. 7. that it they can not be contynent and chaste, let them marye For it
s beter to mary the^ to bur ne but your chur che milita^te believes it beter,
to burn in all manner of filthy co^cupiscens and lust, ye to lyu^ in open
adultery and sin then to marye. And therefore under the pretense of the
setting up and extollyng of their inordinate orders / have they so observed the
glory of honorable matrimony who^ they have set in such despyght and opprobrie
reputyng it so vnpure and unclean, that it may not be ^owyed with their holy
orders, ne celebrated in certain of their state holy ^ymes of the year
whithout their dispe^ satio^. They thought through the forbinding of ma trimony
their prestes, to have i^stitute in their chur che a more pure and cleaner
state of perfection then ever God ordened, but to what a chaste end their holy
^puros^ is come, every man may se, for all the world speak euel and shame of
them, and every man abhor them for their pride and unclean living. But
wherefore did your church mylitant for did their prestes to marye? Because
they were sure to have more a^auntage by their adultery and horedome th^n ever
they should have by their chaste ma trymony. For if they had wives then should
not the Byshopes, Cancelers, Commissares, Scribes and som^^rs be fed so fat
with their adultery and sin as they are. If the prestes had wives, then shul
they have a beter name and fame, then should the yoke and kares of matrimonye
abate their pride and ^ncrese in them virtue and mekenes. But pa^au^ ^ture they
will say that the troubelous sorrows and ^ar^ull state of matrymony should
hinder them from preaching and teaching their parochians, nay verily, for
nothing has let them more from that office, then their w^lthy idle and
unchaste ^yuing and riches, and nothing should forther it more then to have
experience of the cross and trouble, nothing more hinders the word then the
preacher thereof to have an evil name: and that the most part of the^ never
preached nor taught their floke nor n^uer shall, and among these few that
preach because they have no wives* they destroy more with their evil example
of living, then eue^ they edifyed with their preaching, which sclau^derouse
enormite might be reformed if they would receive that honorable and holy
remedy of chaste matrimony ordyned of God for them. ^edlok (says the Apostle
Hebre in the. 13. cap.) is honorable for all men (he excepted none) and the
chamber bed undefiled, but horemongers and adulterers god wylliuge. If it be
honorable for all me^, how should it dishonor prestes that live in perpetual
burning and desire of other me^nes wives, servants and daughters? Why may not
chaste matrimony agree with your holy orders? Is one sacrament iniuryouse,
harmefull or dyshoneste to a another? All your Church mylitant with their
schole doctors say and affirm that the sacraments give grace to the
receivers of them, and how then happens it, that the holy ordered preistes
may not receive the grace of matrimony? But (as I said before) with out
doubt these forbydders of holy matrimony are of the sect of those heretyques
that dampened matrymony as vnpure, beleuyng that it may not be used without
sin: of the which now are those cu^ates which will inioyne their parochia^s
that shall be married, one not to know the the other (abusing Tobias exa^p^e) in
days after the celebratio^ of the sacrament, and will forbyde married persons
to g^ue their du^ beneuol^ce (a^ Paul calls it) to ^^he other in l^nte and
other of their holy times. These me^ doutlesse believe that the act and use of
matrimony is sin and iniuriouse or irreuere^t unto the sa me sacrament that
makes it holy, lawful and ho nourable: these men know not the ver^u and grace
of the word of God, which makes an holy and ^hast act of that which is sin
without y^ same wo^d Paul. ^, Thessa. 4. co^maunoeth the Thessalonia^s the
holy and honorable use of matrimony saing. Let every one of you know to
possess his vessel in holiness and honor. Which doctrine of Paul these
curates rather ought to iustructe them: then to inhibit them that thing which
the word sanctifyeth and makes honorable. Bringing the married peo ple into
this error and co^braunce of conscience to believe that they sin, when they do
well, and to make sin there none is But the blind leads still the blind.
Paul ^^ his Pystles both to Tymothe and Titus warned them that among al other
qualites and conditions belongyng to any man to be chosen priest or over seer
of Christ's flok, they should se that he were a married man and the man of one
wife, that is to say, a liver in chaste matrimonye And wherefore commanded
Paul so dyligently this point of matrimony to be observed? Uerely because he
would have them blameless, for he s^ no bet^^r remedy for their chastity and
good fame to be preserved the^ by chaste matrimony. And why he esteemed a married
man worthy for the cure of any paryshe, he tells Timothe sayng: for if it be
seen unto you that he governs well his own household, bryngyng us his
children in subiecctio^ with all reverence: then may you suppose that the same
man shall also well instruct and teach an hole pareshe or town. But if he can
not rule and govern his own house (says Paul) how shall he teach and take the
charge and cure of the congregacyon of god? Paul says. 1. Cor. 7, that married
persons shall have bodily trouble and what is trouble else but to be cast in to
the pleasure of god to learn much virtue? The governing of his house is an
introdu ction unto a greater cure, there shall he practice and begin to
monyshe in time, and learn to correct with discrecyon and love, now to be
rouge and sharp* ^^en to be merciful and soft, al in time and in good order
to keep them in subjection, fear and learning Then must he learn to be are
the weakness and syknes of wife, children, and seruan^tes with other vi
sitatio^s of god as loss of goods, death of his chil dren, or wife, ^yth other
infinite aduersites and common kares of matrymony. This though Paul to be a
schole and introduction into the spiritual cure of an hole pareshe. But at this
schole were never our preistes and Byshopes, but rather brought up in courtly
welthe and lust. etc. They have formed and reformed many years all other
states and other me^nes lyuynges, until now they their self ar so far out
of frame, that no state or order has more need of reformation then they their
selves. And the word of God that should reform their enormites: they will not
suffer it to come into light: but god for his mercy redress this wicked state
A men.

It is not so long a go that chaste matrymony was forbode^ the preistes. For
at the counsel of Nicene (when they had wives) where they would have first
separated and divorced them from their wives. There rose up an holy man and
confessor called Paphuncius (look in the decrees 31. distinct and. in. 2. lib.
Ecclesiasti tripartite history Ephiphanio scho last interpret. cap. 4) which
man said sl^^fly against it, affirming that wedlok was honorable for all men
and that it is chastity, a man to hold him to his own wife. And thus
persuaded he the general cou^ sell, that they should not lay such a burden
upon any men, affyrmynge it to be greuouse. Which should be the occasyon of
fornicacio^ and adultery both to them that were the^ maryd and to their wives*
These words spoke Papbuncius in the presens of all the counsel:
notwithstanding yet he him self was no married man. And the counsel commended
and allowed his sentence, and decreed nothing as concerning that matter at that
time, but left it in every man's liberty: but si^h that time the church (as
they say) has forboden them to marye. Here ye may se that other that counsel
did a miss and erred in approuyng it lawful for the^ to have wyue or else the
church that did forbyde it: but the counsel can not err (say they) wherefore
then the church erred that decreed the contrary? Of the which Church thus
prophesied Paul in the. 4. Chapter of the first pistle to Timothe saing, that
in the later days some should depart from the faith, geuynge head to sprytes
of error, and to the deuelleshe doctrine of men speaking lies through
hypocrisy, having their consciences marked with a hot yerne, forbyddyng to
marye, and co^maundinge to abstain fro meats which god created to be received
with giving thanks. etc. Thus may you se how lively Paul did set forth your
Church militant here in earth in our own colors that forbode matrimonye and
meats. etc. ye and of what spirit she is governed, and whose doctrine she
folowethe. Oh good God, how many souls have they drawn with their selves to
hell by this one law with forbydding man and woman to marye. What burninges,
what concupisce^ces and unlaw full lusts have this Synagoge of Satan caused
and compelled to raygne and to be karyed about in these perso^es hearts day
and night, that would marye and may, and dare not? ye what adultery fornicacion
with other us clennesses follows up pon this deuelles she doctrine and law of
forbyddin ge matrimonye? And yet thoughtt they (if couetuousnes and ambiciouse
dominion were not the cause (to have iustitute and set up a more pare sperytual
state and order then ever God made. But the holy fruits of their spiritual
ordinance declare the gostlye author, your brother Celerer (say you) asked me
wherefore the Church milytant ordened that the minystres of it should not have
wives or concubines as well now as then, unto the which question you feign an
answer in m^ne name like as you feigned the interrogatio^, for if he had asked
me any such question: I would have denied his false suppositio^, for before this
deuelles she ordinance they had no concubines but lawful wives, and the answer
that you feign is impertine^t to such a que stion. Wherefore if I should have
answered him demanding me why the church milita^t ordined that they should
have no wives, I would have said, because they thought to have a better
a^auntage by their co^cubines then by their wives, and because ma trimony is
more co^br^s and karefull, then to live with another man's wife or with an
hoar, whom he may forsake and take another when he lusts. But you thought
your letters should never come to light and therefore you writ your pleasure.

But God at last shall ask a reckoning wherefore his holy sacrament first of
all institute is now forboden and despised, wherefore they presone and torment
prestes that marye. As verily as the blood of Abell cried and obtained
vengeannce, shall the blood of other good men vexed and slain, obtain the
same to fall upon these persuers and sheders of like innocent blood for keeping
of gods commandments.

Whether a lay man may hear co^fessyons
FOuertly, you say that my opinion was, that every lay man may hear
confessio^s, Sir I am not remembered yt ever I had any co^municatio^ with you of
this matter: but if I had: I thy ke I had said not yt euere lay man, but some
lay man and that after this form which Christ prescribet^ in the* 5. chapter
of Matthew, preferryng love and ^o^corde all sacrifices, a^ if a man has
^ffe^ded his brother and afterward touched with repentance do to him
knowlegyng his offense desiryng him of forgeuenes reconcylyng each other: do
not this lay me^ that hears and forgeueth him hear his confession and
absolve him? Also if a man has any g^ugge and inquietne^ in his conscience by
the reason of sin committed that evermore troubles and fereth him of
dampnation, and this man can not be quiet and ^o^forted ne have any peace in
his heart and assured how and by what means he may have that sure forgeuenes,
which is through faith in Christ, without the which no conscience may be sure
and at rest from the fac^ of sin and da^pnacyon, of the which quyete rest
Paul speaks to the Romans in the* 5. chapter* sayng Because we are justified
by faith we are at peace with god through our Lord I sus Christ* etc. and because
there are now so many blynee ^urates that know no^ this sou^rayne remedy for
sinful and unquiet consciences, but rather dampne it for heresy and persecute
it. If such troubled conciens (I say) go unto a dy^cr^t learned lay man for
wa^te of learned priest (as now thanked be god there are mo lay m^ that koow
this salve then prestes) for counsel and conforte* showing him his grefe and
decease deseryng his counsel and prayer: does not this man after James mind
sayng. Confess or show your sins to each other, and pray one for another
that you may be saved? Then say you that your brother cel^red said that it was
lawful but in time of great need. Merely I never see greater need then even
now to feche this wholesome and s^ete salve that is to say, that only faith in
Christ's death instifyeth and set our hearts at rest at the lay man or women:
the prestes for the most part ar so ignoraunte, so proud and so maliciouse
that they had lever persecute this saving health of manne^ soul* then to
receive it and minister it to their syk flock.

But these two manner of confessio^s presuppose a penitent and a contryte heart
humbled and unfeignedly confessed before God. Of the which manner of confession
David speaks in the* 32. Psalm, after the Hebrew compte in the. 5 verse: I
said, I shall confess my ungodliness which is against me to y^ Lord, and eue^
strayt thou forgeuest it me. Nether is it gods law that men's consciences
should be clogged with tellyng of all their sins that ever they have done in
to a preystes ear: which is impossible for any man to do. When David says
psalm. 19. Who may attain to the knowleg of his sinful nature? Which Jeremy
cap. 17. confirms sayng* Shrewed and unable to be serched is man's heart.
Who can noumbre and tell al his sins which so many circumstances as the Popes
law prescribes us? and yet his disciples teach ve and preach that we ca^ have
no forgeuenes of our syn nes, e^cept wr confess the^ into their ears. Which
doctrine not only vereth not a little many a good simple conscience: but
brings many for fear and shame into desperation. If no sin be forgeuen
wythtout it be reher^ed and told the^ in their ears as they teach us, the^
shall we never have quiet consciences For we commytte full many and they to,
which we can nether see nor remember. Also it is no small injury to Christ's
blood to attribute the forgeuenes of our sins (as they teach) ^o the self
confession. When it is only faith in gods pro mise through Christ's blood that
brings us forgeuenes of our sins and gives us res^e and p^ace in our
consciences. Roma* in the. 5 Chapter. And yet to stableshe their combrouse
confession they are not a shamed to abuse the holy scripture changyng the truth
(as Paul says to the Romans in the first Chapter) in to a lie, taking for
them this place of Matthew in the. 8. Chapter where Christ commanded the man
healed of his leprye to go and show him self unto the preiste. Which place
makes plain agynst them. For the man was hole and clean both body and soul
before he bad him go for his faith first had purified his heart* and then
Christ healed his body, for Christ's cures were perfect in healynge the hole
man. Now this man healed, Christ bad him go show him self to the preiste,
he bad him not go shryue him self to the preyste. He bad him go show his
skin and body For the prestes office was to judge and to decerne when there the
leprye was gone or not, and to dyspose the offering for the clensyng of the
sore, and to have a good porcyon thereof for his duty, as ye may read Leuitici
in the. 13. and. 14. chapter, and as the terte following in Matthew declares, if
you would* diligently note it, and confer the law and the Gospel together
and remember that Christ said he came not to break Moses law but to fulfill it
Christ therefore would not defraude them of the^r duty, nether be prejudice
unto their office, lest they should have accused him of breakyng of Ma ses
law, for they honted for such occasyons fast enough to bring him away, and
therefore he bad the man now healed go show him self to the preiste, that the
pressed might have his priuylege in the judgment of his clensyng of the leprye,
addyng to this commandment, that he should offer the gift tha^ Moses
commanded to be offered (for this was that morsel that the couetouse pre ste
gaped so gredely for) and Christ would not the priest to be disapointed of his
proye, adding also these worcester des. In to a testimony to them self, that is, to
testi fie to the prestes hearts, that although they ho^ted to take him as a
breaker of Moses law, yet here in this cure they mygh well see him observe it
into their own co^dempnatio^, if they did other wise accuse him as any
tra^sgressour thereof, as they did not with standing at the last, their own
co^sciens wytnesyng against them, And even of the violent wrestyng and false
interpretyng of his own text to ^erue for our spiritual belyes and their
ambi^youse impery men may gather and see plainly many other places and textes
of holy scripture to be like wise perverted and turn into their tradycions.
But God avenge and deliver once his pure holy worcester de from the captivity of
these pestele^t skornes and gloriouse glosyng hipocrites.

Amen.
Of pilgrimages and worshypping of Images.
THen you say that I would have men inderision that went on pilgrimag, for what
cau se it came not the^ into your mind, ^ok and you can call the cause in to
your mind, and who told you* this* for I ca^ tell you full well, and who
co^spired with you to observe me and to write my saynges and to co^ceyne such
secret letters, but the lord will se to it and aue^ge Ero. 5. Sir I mocked the^
not* but he that sits in heaven has the^ inderisio^. It is the lord that
scorneth the^* Psalm 2. and that worthily because they forsake him the living
god alone for all sufficient, and ever ready to help all that call upon him in
faith? veryte, and will run after strange gods* into hills, wodes and
so^y^ary places, there to worshype stocks and stones (ye and pa^aue^^ure to do
worse things) of man's making Are not these men to be laughed at, or rather
to be lamented, that may and ought to worshipe god at home in their chamber,
and yet will forsake, wife, children and household (whose presens they behoue)
and spend both body and goods in long and w^arye tranclynges to fall down
and worshipe a stock or a stone made with man's hand? Are not these the
people scatered so broad through out all the land of Egipte to seek chafe?
Erodi in the. 5. chapter Read the second precepte as it stands Erodi in
the. 20. chapter, read the law, the Prophets and the new testament, and look
how greuouslye God threateneth these godgoers and saint sek^rs that should
have but one God, him only to honor and to serve, as Christ testified in the.
4. chapter of Matthew, and that in spiryt and truth even at home in their
hearts. Stand it not written Erodi in the 22 chapter. He that offers to any
gods, that is to say, unto any image, save unto the Lord only: let him dye
without redempeyon? He abhorred strange gods so sore, that he forbode his
people to name them, Exodus in the. 23. Chapter. Hear what I say says in the.
65 chapter. I have stretched fort my hands all this long time past unto a
nation that forsakes me, and seeks strange Gods, ^ hych nacyon goth not
the right way, that is to say, not after my mind and commandments. Which
nacyon ex aspereth and angreth me being present, and yet go they forth to
offer in groves and wodes, doing sacrifices there at autares of stone, sytting
and knelyng by toumbes and shrynes, sleaping in chu^ rhes full of images: let
the schole men excuse this falling down before images kissing of their fete,
kneling, prayng, holding up of hands, steking up of candles, and geuynge them
gifts. ^c. calling for their help in siknes and perel of making their vo was
unto them. Let them cloak their worship with Duly and Hy^erdulia and yet
shall it be Idolatria, when they have made the best for them that they ca^.
God will not be worshyped with our inuencions, but as he him self has
commanded he forbode even the making of Images. For he se that they should
steal away his worshipe. Thus said he Isaie in the. 4. chapt. I am he that is
called the lord: which give not my glory to any other creature nether yet my
praise to any karuen Ima ges. Except you be ashamed of your stocks and I
doles in wodes and hills, in whom you delighted and leave your groves and
gardens, which ye chose for your selves, you shall be like oaks whose leaves fall
a way and like a garden with out water, for the glyst^ryng glory of these
Images shall be turned into stubbe, and the makers of them in to sparkers of
fire, and both of them shall be burnte up to gyther noman quenc^ynge them I say
in the first chapter Read in also in the end of the second chapter. And
hear what the prophet Baruch says of those Idolatres in the. 6. chap. Their
gods verily have golden crowns upon their heads, from whom the prestes
fetch gold and silver and bestow it upon their selves. Also they give of the
same gold and Iwels to hores and make gaye their harlettes their with, and
after that these harlettes have offered them again, they receive them and
deck their gods with the some. And yet are not these gods clean from
rouste and worms, although they be kouered and dect with purple, they must
wype away the duste from their fates, for their houses are full of duste, ^c.
Read the. 44. Chapter of Isaye.

A (...) you put your most reuere^de father in mi^de for forgeting, saing: But
I beseech your lordship y^ no cerature may know that I or any of mine do show
you of things, for the^ I shall lose y^ favor of many in my country. etc. Oh

the^ more the god? Had you lever lose y^ favor of God then of men? Is this the
zele you bare to gods word? Had you lever let it lie still strangled with
hesesye the^ you shall be dysclosed and lose the favor of me^? Wh^^ christian man
would with draw you his favor for auengyng Gods truth from heresye? These ar
the godly spirytuall that take so great pain in persecutyng, presoning and
putting to does with so great labors and study the poor innocent souls and
menbres of Christ for the pure zele they have to god and to his word: secretly
they dare accuse, but not openly. In darkness dare they stand and shot forth
their are was dipped in venom, but not in the light. They think to make the
truth a liar which says in his gospel: there is nothing so secretly done but
it shall be disclosed. But it is your own glory your own honor and idle beles
lust that you se^e and hont for so gredely, and not to deliver Gods truth from
heresies, for it is his tre^e word and the very lively members of his poor
church that you yet per^^cute so cruely, Which abominable blyndnes if you will
not know and repent you at so many daily exhortatio^s, warninges, and
threteninges by gods own word both in Latin and in English so merciful
offered you: look for no another but the vengeance and wrath of God now ha^ging
over your heads, shortly to be powered down upon you. Plages daily ar sent
into your kingdom, and even the Popes he^ which is Antechrist to now broken,
Bobylon is fallen in deed, and all her karuen and graven gods ar brast
against the ground. Isaie in the. 21. chapter. Fle you therefore out of Babylon
and let every man save his life. Jeremy in the. 51. chapter. For there are many
things that threte^ an heavy fall and chang to your Popeshe kingdom. The Lord of
powers has dec^ede to ab^te the pride of all stoutenes, and to pluk down all
the great gloryouse of therthe. Isaye in the. 23. chapter. It is the word of
God (I tell you yet again) that they and you persecute so cruelly. It is
Christ whom you fight against in vain so blindely, and it is the breath of
his mouth, that is to say his almighty word that shall destroy you But
wherefore would you not that any creature should know that you accused me?
Merely Christ declares the cause in the third chapter of Johan sayng. Men
loved the darkness more the^ the light because their works were evil, for
every man that does evil ha^eth the light, nether comes he to the light lest
his works be reproved. God be praised which like as at the beginning he
drewforth the light of darkness, now causes the truth to comforth through your
false opinions and letters Ame^. Your spiritual father was negligent in
keeping your letters. Maledictus homo qui confidit in homine: et carnem facit
brachium suum. Jeremy in the. 17, Chapter,

Now (Master Pryour) if you can declare your opinions otherwise and confirm
the^ by ho ly scripture truly and purely vnderstonden: show forth your mind
in the name of God, and I shall gladly make answer again thereunto: but in the

answer to your letters (...) that can and will judge it after the scripture by

The story of my state, after the bishop had received the pryours letters.
ON the Saterdaye seuennyght before aduent sunday, the year of our Lord. M.
D. XXUII. there were letters sent as from the Car dinall by one of his officers
to Cambrydge, delivered to the vice Canceller called Doctor Edmonds master of
Peter college, where I was the^ feolwe. In which letters he was commanded to
sense me up to appear at Westminster y^ wendesdaye following at. ix. of the
clok with Bylney and Arture, for certain erroneus opynyons. etc. Our master
sent for me on the ^^orow in to the co^ trey, and I came to him, on the
mondaye. He showed me the letters, I red them, and saw the Cardinals sign
manuell subscrybed in great letters* and his seal. I got me horse when it
snewed, and was cold, and came to Londen and so to Westmynster not long after
my hour, when Bilney and Arture were in examinacyon. Which thing when I
hard of, and knew but those two poor sheep among so many cruel wolves I was
not over hastye to thruste in among them, for there was (...) with other of
their faction. And I thought to hear how these two little lambs should speed
year I would put my self into those lyo^s mouths. I went to my diner and
tarried walkyng in the cite. At last on the Saturday I came to a Master of mine
called sir Wyllyam Gascoingue, the Cardinales tresurer: and showed him my
errende, but he knew all the co^uayaunce of my cause better the^ I (for I
believe yet he was the author of all my trouble) and he had me go in to the
chamber of prese^s and there do ctour Capon should present me to the Cardinal.
I was but a course courtyer never before hearing this term chamber of
presence ne knew where it was and I was half a shamed to ask after it, and
went in to alonge entrye on the left hand, and at last happened upon a door
and knocked, and one opened it and when I looked in, it was the kiche^, then I
went back into the hall, and asked for the chamber of presence and one poynted
me up a payer of stayers. The re stood I in the chamber of presence when I would
with all my heart have been absent, waiting for doctor Capo^ almost an hour,
for I was not over hasty to ask after him, there no man knew me nor I them,
there was a great fire in the chamber the wether was cold, and I saw now and
than a Bishop come out, but I durst not stand nyghe the fire for fear of
burning, their was in all about a dosen bishops, whose solemn and lordely
loky^ pleased my not. Whom when I beheld between me and the fire as they
passed forbye, in good faith me though I saw nothing else but the galouse and
the hangme^: but as grace was no^ of the^ knew me Then the tresurer sent for me
down into his chamber, and there he told me, that the Cardynal sent not for
me. Then I began to smell their secret^ conuayaunce, and how they had
counterfeted their lords the Cardinales letters. And here the tresurer sent me
to the bishope of Lyncolne, telling me that a suffragane had accused me. Which
suffragane I never see nor knew. I went a good pase toward the bisshops place
and ouertoke his chaunceler called doctor Rains showing him y^ I would spea ke
with my lord, he showed my lord of me and said that I must come again the
morning at vi. of the clock I d^d so, and waited for my lord at the stayers
foot til it was about. viii. My lord came down and I did my duty to him, he
asked me, be you M. Jove? ye forsothe my lord quod I. Abide said he with my
Chaunceler till I come again (for my lord with all the bishopes took their
barges to wait upon the Cardinal that morning to Grenewiche to the king) I
desired my lord to be good lord unto me and show me eyes pleasure, what his
lordshype would with me, and wherefore I am thus sent unto him: and he answered me
like a lord and bad me tarry with his chaunceler and said I should wait upon his
laiser there took I my leave of my lord and saw him no more Then because M.
Gascoigne rode home ye same day into Bedforde shier, and bad me over even to
come again on the morrow and tell him how I sped: I desyerde M. chaunceler to
go to him promisyng to come again at such a time as he would apointe me at my
lords coming home, for he told me that my lord would come again the same day
about. ii. or, iii. of the cloak. I came to M. Gascoing which I perceived by
his words favored me not, and he re buked me because I studied Arigene, which
was an heretic said he, and he said y^ I held such opinions as did Bilney and
Arture: which disco^forted me very sore, when I perceived him to be my enemy
whom I took for my good master: there I saw him last (...) hour and showed my
self to M. chau^celer. And there daunsed I a cold attendance till all most
night, and yet my lord was not come, then I went to M. chau^ celer with who^
was Watson the scribe, desyryng him that I might depart for I though my lord
would not come home that night, sayng that I had far to my lodging, and I
loved not to walk late lo the they were I perceived, and especially the scribe
that I should go: but they would nether bid me to supper nor promise me
lodging, and I made haste sayng that I would come again on the morrow to se and
my lord were come home. Then said the scribe where is your lodgi^g? and here I
was so bold to ma ke the scribe a lie for his askyng, telling him that I lay
at the grene drogon toward Bisshops gate when I lay a mile of, even a contrary
way, for I never trusted Scribes nor pharisais, and I perceived he asked me
not for any good. Here I bad the^ both good night. As I went now I thought
thus with my self, I am a scholar of Cambridge under only y^ vice chau^celers
jurisdiction and under the great God the Cardinal, and M. Gascoinge said the
Cardinal sent not for me, I will take a brethe year I come to these me^
again. On the morrow I was not over hasty to come to the chaunceler, but as I
walked in the city, I met with a scoler of Cambrydg and he told me y^ the
bishop of Lincoln had sent his servant besely to enquire and to seek me,
what is the matter quod I? Mary quod he it is said that he would give you a
benefice for preaching in his dio^ese, A benefice quod I? ye a Malefice rather,
for so re ward they men for weldoynge. Then I got me horse and rode fro my
Benefice, and left college and all that I had and conuayed me self toward
the sea side ready to flee farther if need were. But many a foul Ieoperdouse
and forowfull iourny had I year I came there. And in my traueli^g I met with
a good fellow o^ mi old acquai^taunce which mer ueled greatly to see me in so
strange a country to whom I o^ened my mind showing him partly of my
kareful state, troublouse and paynfull iournes that I had both by unknown
ways and also be night many times. Be my trowthe quod he I meruel ye be not
robbed so many theueshe ways as you have ryden. And then he warned me of a
theue she pla ce that I must needs ride bye, and asked him again know you the
place and what great men dwell theraboutes? ye well said he, then quod I But
dwell there any bishopes that way? (for I had lever have met with. xx. thieves
the^ with one bishope) nay quod he then was I glad, and rode on my way, and
ever blessed me from byshopes, But the bishop of Lincoln laid preuey wait for
me to be taken and my fete bound under an horse ^ely to brought in him. Then be
as the great bishop of Ely our visitour, angry supra* modum, and yet he would
have cyted me viis and mo ^is expulsed me my college when I was gone (had my
flight prevented his coming, Sed benedictus dominus qui non dedit me in
captione dentibus eorum. Amen.

Now M. priour, if there be any thing in this my answer that offends you,
blame your self and not me, you first rolled the stone, and I am not yet
(thanked be god so feabled, but that by gods help, I am able to roll it you
again, not to hurt you as you hurted me, but rather to heal your ignorance
with the trwe knowleg of gods word And where as I am not so pacie^t in my
answer as I ought to be, and as you desire, I pray you impute it unto the
common decease of all me^ borne of Ada^ whose child I am, and yet sta^ed with
those ^arna^ affectes souked out of him fro my co^cepcio^ and ca^ not be fully
mortified but by death, then to be perfect renewed in spirit and made like our
brother Christ the first begote^ among his many brotheren. But yet of this
one present conforte we are here alsure that believe in gods promise, that is
to say, al our infirmites and sin (of the which as long as we are in this
mortal flesh we ca^ not be perf^tly deliuerd) to be swelowed in christ's death
through our faith, nether shall they be imputed unto us, Christ being our
ryghtuousnes, wisdom, holiness, our redemption, and our satisfaction before his
father, your let ters (as god knows) wroght me much trouble, and more the^ I
will express at this time, but much more had they wroght me if I had tarried,
they drew out of my breast many a deep syghe, and many a salt tear out of my
eyes, they made me suddenly to fle, to forsake my poor^ living, my college, my
lerning my promotion and all that I had. They drowe me forth with great
pouertye and not with a litel heaviness and perell by sea and land out of my
native land Whose desire yet holds me, for that I would right gladly
return and dare not, being exiled into a strange land among rude and
boisterous people, with whose manners I can not well agree, which i^ to me no
lyt^ll cross, your letters caused me not only to forsake my kynne and
fre^des, but they s^au^dered me so g^eudusly that they made them to forsake me,
and so to hate me that yet I can not come again in to their favor, for they
abhorred me so sore after y^ your secret letters had openly defamed me, that
they would not suffer me to come into their houses nor speak with me, nor
help me, but fled fro me and lothed me as I had be^ a kocketrice which slaith
only with his sight, which before both loved me and were right glad of my
company, which all I dare ^ have borne against me which never offended you^ but
only to evil counsel and ignorance, for I think you have a good zele to
god, but (as Paul says) not according to knowledge. For if you had know en
Christ and his word you would never have done thus unto me I know it well. But
I forget it and forgive it you as I would God to forg^ue me my sins,
desiering only a better mind in you endued with perfect knowledge ^ ^^^th where
upon I writ^e this answer for your instruceyon to deliver you (if God will
(from ignorance and errors: for many a man believes another to err, when he
him self is fare out of the way, but the scripture brings every man into
the right way and the very spiritual ingeth al things. Now therefore that we
^ought both savor and understand a like one thing according to Jesus Christ:
and glorify god the father with oue mind and mouth. I desire you to read my
an swer yet again with a patience and with an heart purged from all carnal
affectes, and confer it with the scriptures purely not wrested with men's
gloses nor with long customs, nor yet with the Popes decrees and his church
which without the scripture are da^yned in there own self, for he has decla
red and declares him self daily with his me^bres to be nothing less then
those men which ha^^e been hitherto received and taken of many and yet do daily
persuade and bost them to be, the word of God contrary wise uttering him with
all his to be that adversary of whom Paul prophesied and painted so lively
under the person of that sinful man and sone of perdition in the second
chapter of the second p^ stle to the Tessalonians, warning us of this
adversary and Antichriste, sayng: Let noman deceive you by any means, for the
lord comes not except there come a departinge before (of the which departinge
read 1. Timo. in the fowerth chapter, and in one place of y^ scripture after
Peter's mind expou^de another) and that sinful man be opened even the son of
perdition which is an adversary, and is extolled against all that is called
God, and gets him self a worship above all worship and honor so that he
shall sytte in the ^^mple of God, and show him self as god. Paul says that
we are the temple of God. and does not the Pope and his with their traditions
sit deper in our consciences then God with his commandments? Men make more
conscience at the breaking of the popes laws the^ gods, and fere more to
break them then Gods, for the breaking of the Popes laws only is all this
persecution, presoninge, loss of goods, shame and burning, and not for the
transgressinge of gods precepts. The very church of God never persecu ted
any man ne put them to death nor never shall. Abell slew not Cain, nether
Isaac persecuted Ismaell. Read forth the same* 2. chapter. ^. Tessaloand lok^
whether the Pope be not Antychryste. God give you grace by reading his word
to deceive Christ from Antichryste, and god from the ungodly, to fle by time
out of Babylon, and to save your soul.

Amen.
