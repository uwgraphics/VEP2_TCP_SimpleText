To the Right Honorable, THE LORD ROCKINGHAM*
My Lord,
I Have been long indebted both to your Lordship, your noble Lady, and your
hopeful Son Mr. Watson for your favors and good will toward me; I have
therefore adventured (not by way of requital, but of acknowledgment) to present
this Theological Epitome to You, which is the most exact and compendious of any
that has been yet done by Protestant Writers: I may say of this Edition, as
Philosophers speak of Nature; that, It is neither deficient in necessaries, nor
abundant in superfluities: What was in the Latin Copy dark, I have cleared; and
what was contracted, I have unfolded. How needful Epitomies are in all
Sciences, chiefly in Divinity, I need not write; if either we consider the
shortness of our time, or the largeness and multitude of Volumes, which have
been written of this Subject, or the weakness of our memories, or the
fastidiousnesse that is begot in us by reading tedious and voluminous
Discourses, God who knows what is best for us, has epitomized all Practical
Divinity into X Precepts, and our Savior has reduced those ten into two, and
all that we can pray for, or against, into six heads or Petitions. The
Traveller that desiers to be soon at his journeys end, will seek out the most
compendious way: He is an unwise Traveller that will clog himself with silver,
if he can epitomize it into Gold; surely a weak Stomach will better retain the
smal^ quantity of an extract, than the large draught of a nauseating potion: He
that with judgment does contract the vast body of Divinity into an Abridgment,
does imitate God, who having the first day diffused the light through the whole
Hemisphere, contracted it, and as it were epitomized it the fourth day within
the body of the Sun: He that will condemn Epitomies, condemns himself; for man
is the epitomie of the World, But I must avoid prolixity in commending this
Epitomie, lest my practice thwart my words. My Lord, This Book is the Epitomie
of Divinity; and this Epistle, the Epitomie of my true affection, and many
thanks I owe you and yours: on whom I wish the influence of all happiness,
which is the hearty desire of

Your Lordships Humble Servant, ALEXANDER ROSS

The Preface of John Wollebius D.D. to the Reader.
THE blessed Apostle, in his second Epistle to Timothy, cap. 1 verse. 13, writes
thus: Hold fast the form of good words, which thou have heard of me, in faith
and love. An excellent admonition and worthy to be pressed upon all Christans;
but chiefly on these who have wholly devoted themselves to the study of
Divinity. For as it concerns every Christian to be skilled in the chief
Chatechistical heads at least, that by their help and guide they may with the
greater profit hear and read Gods Word; so it becomes all Students in
Divinity, before all things to imprint in their memories the Anatomy of the
Body of Theology; that in the Common places, in the definitions and Divisions
of heavenly doctrine, they may be exact and perfect. Now in this kind diverse
eminent men, furnished with a far greater measure of Spiritual Unction than my
self, have afforded such helps to young Students, that he, who goes about to
add any thing to these* will seem to light a Candle at noonday, or to garnish
the Firmament with more Stares: Yet notwithstanding, whereas it is consistant
with the conscience and callings of all Gods servants, to advance what they can
the public benefit; I being called to be chief Pastor in this place, was
enjoined by the Reverend College of Divines to expound the Old Testament,
which by Gods help and their command I so undertook, that besides my Lectures
on the Text, I proposed to my hearers a short form of wholesome and good words,
taken out of other men's lucubrations, and reduced into this brief Epitome. Now
although I perceived that many did very well like my pains and purpose in this
kind; yet I profess, the divulging of this Piece was least in my thoughts.
Therefore, in that at last this Child, of which I have been in labor these
seven years, is now born and brought out to light; I earnestly entreat the
friendly Reader to impute this, not to any itching humor I have of writing,
but to the often solicitations of my Friends, who have extorted it from me, I
beseech God, that he will be pleased graciously to preserve the remaining
companies of Teachers and Scholars, and that for his mercies sake, whereof we
have daily fresh testimonies, as in many things, so in this, that we are not
all destroyed: And as for those who are dispersed that he would graciously
recollect and settle them, even for his only begotten Sons sake our Lord Jesus
Christ Amen.

THE PRAECOGNITA OF Christian Divinity.
CHristian Divinity, is the doctrine of the Knowledge and Worship of GOD, to
his glory, and our salvation.

The RULES or CANONS are these
I. This word Theology, or Divinity is diversely taken: but in this place is
understood that knowledge of God, which a Christian may attain unto in this
life out of Gods word.

The word Theology being taken abusively, is sometime used for the Gentiles
Divinity, which was threefold: Poetical, or fabulous, Philosophical* or
natural, Sacerdotal, or political; the scope and end whereof was to contain the
rude multitude within the compass of obedience by some religious exercise, be
what it will. But Theology properly so called, is either Original or derived.
Original, is that knowledge whereby God knows himself, which really differs not
from Gods essence. Derived, is a certain image or representation of that
Orig^nal, primarily in Christ our mediator, secondarily in Christ's members. Now
whereas a part of Christ's members is triumphant in heaven, another part
militant here on earth; that Theology of the triumphant part is called the
Theology of the blessed Saints; that of the militant, is styled the Theology
of Travelers.

II. Theology in this place is considered not as a habit residing in the
intellect, but as a Systeme or collection of precepts: therefore it is defined
by the word Doctrine.

For Theology, as it is comprehended within certain precepts, is different from
the habit of Theology, as the efficient cause from the effect. Now the question
is, if we consider Divinity as a habit of the Intellect, what genus shall we
assign for it out of all the intellective habits? surely there is none, which
if it be taken solely and apart, is not of a narrower compass than the thing
defined. For tha^ hab^t which apprehend the Principles, called Intelligentia;
and tha^ habit which demonstrates the Conclusion out of the Principles called
Scientia; and tha^ habit which arises out of the two former call'^ Sapientia,
are habit merely contemplative but for Prudentia, it is an active habit directing
the mind in its actions, and Art is an effective or operative habit with right
reason. A. R. Divinity is more speculative, than practical, because it
principally handles divine things, and in the second place humane actions. But
as it is, a practical science, it is the most noble of all practical sci^nces,
because the end of it is beatitude, to which the ends of all other sciences are
ordained. Divinity also may be called wisdom, or sapientia, because it
considers the chiefest of all Causes, not only as He is known by his eff^cts,
but as He is known in himself also.
Divinity then consists partly in contemplation, partly in action. Therefore
Divinity may bear the name both of Sapience, and Prudence; Sapience so far
forth as it apprehends the Principles by means of the Inteligence being
divinely illuminated, and from thence demonstrates the conclusions by means of
Science; Of prudence, so far forth as it directs the mind of man in it its
actions.

III. There is a twofold principle of Divinity; the one by which it is, and
that is GOD; the other by which it is known, and that is the Word of God.

IV. Gods word at first was unwritten, before Moses his time; but after Moses
it was written, when God in his most wise counsel would have it to be sealed
and confirmed by Prophets and Apostles.

That the Papists may obtrude upon us their unwritten traditions instead of
Gods written oracle, they would bear us in hand that the Word was written only
upon hap-hazard, or contingent occasions. But so many mandates to write,
delivered to the Prophets and Apostles, do cry down this error. Exodus 17.14.
and 34.27. Deuteronomy. 31.19 Isa. 8.1. and 30.8. Ier 30.2 Hab. 2.2. Re. 1.11.19 and
14.13. and 19.9 and 21.9. The testimonies of the Apostles proclaiming that
nothing was said or written by man's advice or counsel, cry out against this
error. John 20.31 But these things are written, that ye might believe, etc. Rom
15.4. But what things are written are written for our learning, that through
patience and comfort of the Scriptures we might have hope. 1 Cor. 10.11. These
things are written to admon^sh us. 1 Timothy 3.16 All Scripture is given by divine
inspiration. And 2 Pet. 1.20 21. So that ye first know this, that no Prophecy
in the Scripture is of any private motion: for Prophecy came not of old time
by the will of man, but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the holy
Ghost. Lastly these precepts cry out against them by which we are directed to
the w^itten word in matters of salvation. Isa 8.20. To the law and to the
testim^ny. John 5 39. Search the Scriptures.

V. We acknowledge therefore no other A. R. He means that which is called
principium cognoscendi; which is the first instrument by which we come to know
the end and media of Divinity, and out of which all the precepts of Divinit^
are concluded. But there is another principle of Divinity which is called
principium effendi, and that is God.
principle of Divinity than the written word of God.

VI. It is an unquestionable Principle amongst Christians, that the Holy
Scripture is both of a divine original and authority.

VII. It is then a question ill beseeming a Christian, to demand whether the
Scripture or holy Bible be Gods word or not?

For as in the Schools there is no desputing with him who denies Principles; so
we account him unworthy to be heard, who will deny this principle of Christian
Religion.

VIII. Among Christians it is lawful to ask, By what testimony do we know that
the Scriptures are by divine inspiration? So we ask not for this end, to seduce
others, or to cavel, but only to be instructed.

IX. Now this testimony is twofold the one principal, the other ministerial.
The principal testimony is that of the Holy Spirit, outwardly in the Scripture
it self, inwardly in the minds and hearts of the faithful, being illuminate by
him, speaking and persuading the divinity of the Scriptures, But the
ministerial testimony is the testimony of the Church.

Outwardly in the Scriptures themselves, the holy Ghost, when he speaks of the
divine original and authority of the Word, uses these phrases; The word of
the Lord, Thus says the Lord. Jesus said, All Scripture is by divine
inspiration. 2 Timothy 3.16. Holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy
Ghost. But inwardly in the hearts of the faithful he persuades the divinity of
Scriptures, so far forth as he opens the eyes, and illuminates the mind of
him that reads the Scripture with prayer and humility, that he makes him see
the wonders of God, and causes him to acknowledge the voice of Gods Spirit
sounding in the Word.

The Romanists urge the Churches authority alone, which they have in such high
esteem, that they will have the whole authority of Scriptures to have its
dependence from the Church; and for this only cause they will have it to be
Gods Word, because the Church is the witness of it, But this is not to make
the Church a witness of the Scriptu^es divinity, but to make her self capable
of divinity. But we will prove by these ensuing arguments, that the testimony
of Gods Spirit alone is it, which firmly assures us of the scriptures divinity
1. His testimony concerning the Scriptures is most firm, by whose inspiration
the Scripture was written: For every one knows his own hand best, and is best
a^quainted with his own sti^e: But the Scripture was written by the inspiration
of the holy Ghost, 2 Timothy 3.16. 2 Pet. 1.20, 21. Ergo, etc. 2. He that together
with the Scripture is promised in a most near conjunction to the faithful, his
testimony of the Scripture is most firm: But the Holy Ghost is promised to the
faithful in a most near conjunction with the Scripture. Esa. 59.21. My spirit
which is in thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart
from thy mouth. 3. Without whose illumination, the wonders of the Scripture are
not seen, his testimony alone of the Scripture is most firm: But without the
illumination of the Holy Ghost, no man sees the wonder of the Scripture. Psalm.
119.18. Open my eyes, that I may see the wonders of thy Law. Ergo, etc. 4.
Whose office it is to lead us into all truth, he it is that witnesses this
truth, to wit, that the Scripture is Gods word. But it is the office of the
Holy Ghost, to lead us into all truth, John 16 13. Ergo, etc. Now as for the
Churches testimony, although it is to be received as from Gods Minister, yet it
is false that the Scriptures authority depends on it: For what can be more
absurd, than to make the words of the Master to receive their authority from
the Servant; or the Fathers letters to receive credit, from the foot^post; or
the Princes mandates, from the Printer, or that the Rule should have its
dependence from the thing ruled? We know that the oracles of God are committed
to the Church, Romans 3.2. and that she is the pillar and ground of truth. 1 Timothy
3.15. But as it is foolish to tell us, that the candle receives its lights from
the candle-stick that supports it, so it is ridiculous to ascribe the
Scriptures authority to the Church. The Churches testimony may be prevalent
with those who as yet know not the Scriptures, and have not received that
sincere milk of the word, nor by it are grown up, 1 Pet. 2* 2. But in those who
have tasted the sweetness of divine oracles, the testimony of Scriptures and
of the Holy Ghost is most firm and effectual: For as he who tastes honey
himself, has a more sure knowledge of its sweetness, than he that believes
another speaking and witnessing of it: even so, he knows more assuredly the
Scriptures to be Gods Word, who has tasted its sweetness, than he who gives
credit to the Church witnessing this sweetness. The Samaritans at first
believed, the woman when she spoke of Christ but after they heard Christ
himself, they say to the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying, for
we have heard him our selves and know that this is indeed the Christ, the
Savior of the world, Joh. 4.42. Even so he that having begged the assistance
of Gods Spirit reads the Scriptures again and again, at length says, Now I
believe no longer for the Churches testimony, that the Scriptures are divine;
but because I have read them my self, and in reading have stamped this
Syllogism in my mind.

1. That Scripture which everywhere brings in God himself speaking 2. Which is
written by those men who being furnished with the gifts of prophesying and
miracle from God extraordinarily* do with such faithfulness record all things,
that in rehearsing of sins and infirmities, they neither spare themselves nor
friends. 3. Who record not only truths, and things agreeing with right reason,
but divine matters also and such as transcend all reason. 4. After a divine
manner, and in a wonderful harmony of circumstances in the same things
rehearsed by different Writers. 5. To the Glory of God alone and our salvation.
6. With admirable efficacy, both in moving the hearts, and corroborating them
against most exquisite tortures, 7. In the miraculous preservation of it
against Diabolical and Tyrannical fury: That Scripture, I say, which thus
delivers these things, is doubtless divine, both in its Original, and in its
Authority; But such is the holy Scripture; Therefore, it is Divine both in its
Original and in its Authority.

That I may then contract the matter in brief the Testimony of the Church; is
first in respect of time; but that of the Holy Ghosts, is first in regard of
Nature and efficacy. We believe the Church but not for the Church; but we
believe the holy Ghost for himself. The Churches Testimony does monstrate but
not demonstrate; it shows the (...) that the thing is, but the holy Ghost
Testimony shows the (...) or the cause. The ^wasive power is in the Church, but
the persuasive in the spirit only. The Churches Testimony begets an opinion,
but the Testimony of Scripture begets Science and ^ firm Faith.

X. The Canonical Books of Scripture, are partly of the Old, partly of the New
Testament: To the Old belong the five Books of Moses, Josuah, Judges, Ruth;
these Books are single, the Books of Samuel, of the Kings, of the Chronicles
are double; The Books of Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Job, Psalms, Proverbs,
Ecclesiastes, Canticles, the four greater Prophets, and the twelve lesser are
single. Now of the New Testament, are, The four Evangelists, The Acts of the
Apostles, The Epistles of Paul to the Romans one, To the Corinthians two, to
the Galathians, EEphesians, Philippians, and Colossians single. To the
Thessalonians and Timothy double; to Titus, Philemon, and Hebrews single, The
Epistles of Peter two, of John three, of James and Jude single, and the
Revelation.

XI But for the books of Tobiah, Judith, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, Esdra 3, 4. of
Machabees 1, ^, 3. of Baruch 1 The Prayer of Manasses, The Epistle of Jeremiah,
The Additions to Daniel and Esther; Although they may be read with profit, yet
they come short of that authority, which is in the Canonical Books, for proving
Articles of Faith, and therefore they are called Apocrypha, that is, hid or
obscure.

The reasons be these, 1. Because they were not written by the Prophets, but
they have been written for the most part, since Malachi, the last of the
Prophets. 2. Because they are not written in the Style or Phrase of the
Prophets, or in the Hebrew Tongue. 3 Because they are never alleged in the New
Testament. 4. Because in reading of them we find many passages contrary and
inconsistent with Canonical Scripture, besides many fabulous, and repugnant to
Faith and P^ety.

XII. The Holy Scripture is sufficient to Salvation.

2 Timothy 3 16, 17. The whole Scripture is by Divine inspiration* and is
profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction* for Instruction in
Righteousness, that the man of God may be perfect and thoroughly furn^shed to
every good work.

XIII. Therefore as the constitutions of the Church conducing to the right
usage of outward Rites, are in their one place to be regarded, so no tradition
is to be admitted as necessary to salvation, except the Scripture.

The Romanists do not only fight for popish Traditions, but also equal them,
nay* prefer them to the holy Scriptures; but we are content to rest in that
command of God, which forbids to add to, or take away from his word, Deuteronomy.
4.2. and 5.32. and 12.32. Rev. 22.18.

XIV. The search of holy Scripture is enjoined to all Christians.

Joh. 5.39. Search the Scriptures, Colos. 3.16. Let the word of God dwell
plentifully among you; Neither is that obscurity of holy scripture, which the
Pontificians pretend, any obstacle to this our assertion, for though it be
obscure in some places, yet in other places it explains it self, and delivers
the prime articles of Religion, with great perspicuity.

XV Therefore the translation of the Bible unto vulgar Tongues is necessary.

XVI. Yet no translation is authentical but that which agrees with the
Original fountains of the Hebrew and Greek*

XVII. Although the Interpretation of Scripture is committed to the Church, yet
the only supreme Judge of this interpretation is the Holy Ghost speaking in it.

Esaias. 59.29. My Spirit which is in thee, and my words which I have put in thy
mouth, shall not depart from thee. 2 Pet. 1.20, 21. So that you first know
this, that no prophecy in the Scripture is of any private motion; for the
prophecy came not of o^d time by the will of man, but holy m^n of God spoke as
they were moved by the Holy Ghost. Therefore sacrilegiously do the Pontificians
arrogate to the Church of Rome, or to the P^pe alone, this right of supreme
judge.

XVIII. The sense and meaning of each Scripture is but one; yet in the
Prophesies of the Old Testament it is composed of a history, and mystery.

For example, Hos. 11. ver. 1. In these words, When Israel was a child then I
loved him, and called my son out of Egypt; I be sense is compounded: for
literally and historically, they are to be understood of the delivery of the
Israelites out of Egypt; but ^ypically and mystically, of Christ's calling out
of Egypt. Matthew. 2.^5.

XIX. The means to find out the true sense of Scripture, are, Frequent
prayers; the knowledge of tongues the looking into the Fountains; the
cons^deration of the scope and argument^ the distinc^ion of proper t^rms from
figurative; the logical analysis or nothing of the Causes, the circumstances,
the passages going before and coming after; the comparing of obscure places
with cleerer, of like with like, and of disagreeing places with each other
lastly, the analogy of faith.

XX. As God is the proper and prime object, so is he also the principal and
suprem end of Divinity.

XXI Whereas then the chief end, and the chief good, are one and the same
thing, it is manifest that Christian Divinity only does rightly teach us
concerning the chief good.

XXII. The subordinate end of Divinity in our salvation, which consists in
the union and fruition of God.

The parts of Divinity are two* The first is of the knowledge of God; the
second, of the worship of God. The first contains faith, or the things to be
believed; the second, works, or the things to be performed.

THE FIRST BOOK OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOD.
CHAP. I. Of the Essence of GOD.
GOD is a Spirit, existent eternally in himself; One in Essence, Three in
Persons, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

God is known in himself, and in his works.

In himself, he is known absolutely in his essence, relatively in the Persons.

Gods essence is known A. R. The knowledge we have of God here, is nominal, not
real. 2. Confused, not distinct. 3. From his effects, a posteriori. 4. By way
of n^gation; we know what he is not, rather than what he is. 5. By way of
eminenci^* we know that what perfection is in the creature, is more eminently
in him. 6. By the motions of things, we ga^her, there must be a chief mover. 7.
From the degrees of entity, truth, and goodness in the creatures, we collect
that there must be one chief entity, truth, goodness^ etc (...) From the
possibilities and contingencies that are in all things, we infer, there must
be one chief necesssary entity.
by his Names, and by his Properties.

The names of God are either taken from his essence as Iehova, Iah, Eheje, to
which in the New Testament, the name (...) Lord does answer for the most part;
or from his power, as El, Elohim; or from his Al-sufficiency, as Shaddai; or
from his Excellency, as Helion.

The RULES or CANONS.
I. The name Jehovah, is Gods chief and most proper Name.

For it is derived from the root hajah, he was; So it is the symbol of that
Supreme entity which was, is, and is to come from eternity to eternity, Rev.
1.4, 6. Because he remains still the same, Psalm. 102.28. And is the cause of the
being of all things, Act. 17.28. Hence is it proper to God. Esaias. 42.8. Neither
is it ascribed to the creatures but Metonymically, so far forth as they are
symbols of Gods presence So it is given to the Altar, Exo. 17.15. to the Ark,
Psalm. 47.6. to Jerusalem, Ezech. 48.35.

II. The same name in promises and Divine comminations or threatenings is of
great force.

Hence are these phrases: Thus says Jehovah, the word of Jehovah, etc. For
Gods Word is as sure, as himself is true, or as he endures still like himself.

III. The name Elohim, though of the plural number, yet is not the personal,
but an essential Name of God, and according to the Hebrew Idiotism, it is
spoken of one God: and of each person: ^ence there are not three Elohim or
Gods, but one alone.

As it is righ^ly said in the Creed of Athanasius: ^he Father A^mighty, the Son
A^mighty, the Holy Ghost Almighty, yet not three Almighties, but on Almigh^y.
So because God is called Elohim from his power, there are not three but one
Elohim, Ps. 7.9. Elohim Z^ddik just God.

The Divine properties are Gods attributes, by which he is pleased to make
himself known to us weak Mortals, and is by them distinguished from the
Creatures.

The RULES.
I. The Properties in God are not qualities or accidents, or real entities,
different from the essence, or from each other.

This will appear below, in the attribute of Gods simplicity.

II. The Divine properties are neither separable from the essence, nor from
each other.

This Rule overthrows the Lutheran Tenet, concerning the transfusion of the
Divine properties into the Human Nature of Christ: for if this be capable of
ubiquity, omniscience, omnip^tency, why not also of eternity?

And these Properties are either incommunicable to the Creatures, or
communicable in some analogical effects. Of the first rank are his Simplicity
and Infinity.

Among these are reckoned his imutability and perfection; but these are only
Corollaries, or Appendices to his simplicity and infinity.

His Simplicity is that, by which he is known to be an entity truly, one and
free from all compo^ition.

His Infinity is that by which he is known to be an entity infinitely true and
good and without measure or bounds.

The RULES.
I. God is A. R. There is no composition in God, neither Physical, nor Logical,
nor Metaphysical; because in him there is no priority nor posteriority, as in
composition where the compositum is posterior to the parts compounding. 2. In
composition there is act and possibility; but God is all act. 3. In composition
the parts differ from the compositum; but in God there is no difference. 4.
There is no composition in the form; but God is a most simple form. 5.
Whatsoever is compounded has a cause of that composition; but in God there is
no cause.
an entity, truly and most simply One.

Because he is not compounded of parts, nor of a genus and a difference, nor of
substance and accident, nor of a possibility and act, nor of entity and essence.

II. There is then nothing in God, which is not God himself.

III. Gods essence is by us incomprehensible.

For there is no proportion between finite and infinite, no more than between a
nutshell and the Ocean.

IV. God is altogether all, all in himself, all in all things, all in every
thing, and all out of every thing.

V. God is neither circumscribed, nor defined by place, nor is included within
it, nor excluded without it.

VI. God is eternal, without beginning, without end, without change.

The properties of the later rank are, 1. The life of God. 2. His Intellect. 3.
His Will. 4. His power. His life, is the attribute of his being; His Intellect,
of knowing: His Will, of commanding; His power, of execution.

The RULES
I. The Properties of the latter rank, are ascribed to God, according to the
properties of the first, that is, most simply and infinitely.

II. Hence these are predicated, or spoken ^f God, not only in the concrete,
but in the ^bstract also.

For not only is he named living, wise, good, just, but also life, wisdom,
goodness, justice.

III. Whereas the life of God is most simple and infinite; it will follow, 1.
That his life, and his actual living is all one. ^. That though he has no
other cause than himself, by which he lives, yet he is the cause of life in
all living creatures, in respect of whom their life is but as it were begged
and borrowed. 3. That the life of God is most perfect, most blessed and
immutable.

IV. Whereas the understanding of God is most simple and infinite; it follows
that he A. R. Whereas to understand is to comprehend the thing understood; God
does not properly understand, that is, comprehend himself, for so he should be
less than himself; but he understands himself negatively, that is, he is not
ignorant of himself.
understands himself primarily as an infinite object. 2. That he knows all
things most exquisitely, though they are not revealed to the Creatures. 3. That
he knows all things by himself, 4. And that by one and most simple act; for
he needs no revelation, nor discourse, either from the effect, or from the
cause, from that which is more known, to that which is less known. 5 Thing past
and things to come, are no less known to him, then things present. 6. His
knowledge is infinite. 7. Fr^ from all ignorance and oblivion

V. Whereas the will of God is most simple* therefore, ^. In him there are not
either two, or more, or contrary Wills.

There are in deed diverse distinctions of his Will, a^ shall be seen in the
Doctrine of God^ Decrees: but these distinctions are nominal, rather than real.

2, The primary object of Gods will, is God himself. 3 The will of God is most
free. 4. Nothing is done against the Will of God. 5. The Will of God, according
to its diverse objects has diverse names, to wit, of holiness, goodness, love,
grace, mercy, wrath, justice, and such like.

VI. Whereas the power of God is most simple and infinite; it fol^ows, ^. That
his power is one. 2. That he is truly omnipotent for not only can he do what
he will, but also more then he will, 3. From the power of God, we must not
infer A. R. There is in God a twofold power, the one absolute, the other
ordinary* by that he can do all that may be done; by this he can do only those
things which his justice and will commands to be done.
the act or being of a thing, unless when his will and power are joined
together The object of Gods omnipotency is, whatsoever is not repugnant to his
nature, or implies a contradiction; and therefore is rather of not
impossibilities, then of possibilities.

Therefore to lie, to make the thing done undone, or to make man's body
infinite, and such l^ke, ^an no ways be ascribed to God; for these are actions
not of power, but of impotencie.

5. The power of God is altogether irresistible.

CHAP. II Concerning the persons of the Deity
THe Persons of the Deity are subsistences, each of which has ^he whole
essen^e of God differing notwithstanding in their incommunicable properties.

The RULES
I. The words of Person, Trinity, or (...), that is, some essence; although
they be not found in Scripture in the same syllables, yet they are consonant to
the Scripture, and are profitably used by the Church.

II. The word Hypostasis or Hyphistamenon, that is Subsi^tence, are of a larger
extent then the word person.

For Hypostasis or Hyphistamenon, is any individual substance; but the word
Person, signifies an individual substance, complete, rat^onal, and differing
by incommunicable properties from another* yet the Apostle, Heb. 1.3. uses the
word Hypostasis for Person, by the figure called Metalepsis.

III. The Person in the Deity, is neither the A. R. Though this name Person be
common to all the three, yet it is not predicated as genus or species because
the Persons of the Trinity differ not nume^ically, much less essentially; as
they must of which genus and species are predicated.
species of God, or of the Deity, nor a part thereof, nor another thing besides
the Deity, nor a bare relation, nor the manner only of subsisting, but the
very essence of God, with a certain manner of subsisting.

IV. Neither yet is the person a thing compounded of entity, and nonentity
neither are the essence of God, and the manner of subsisting, two different
things, but a thing, or entity, and the manner of the entity.

The Persons of the Deity are three; Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. The Father is
the first person of the Deity, existing from himself, begetting the Son from
eternity, and with him producing the Holy Ghost.

The Son is the second person, begotten of the Father from eternity, with the
Father producing the Holy Ghost.

The Holy Ghost is the third Person of the Deity, proceeding of the Father and
the Son from eternity.

The RULES.
I. The Trinity is not the number A. R. The number numbering may be understood
essentially God, or the Soul, or an Angel; for so Plato calls the soul a
number: or, number numbering may be taken accidentally, for those discreet
quantities which we call numbers, as two, three, four, and in this sense the
Trinity is not the number (...), because this is an accident.
numbering, but the number numbered.

II. The Doctrine of the Trinity is not a bare tradition of the Church, but a
Doctrine expressed in Holy Writ.

This is against the Papists, who to evince the insuffi^iency of Scripture, are
not afraid to affirm the contrary.

III. Although in the Old Testament, the Doctrine of the Holy Trinity, was
somewhat obscure, yet it was not altogether unknown.

Genesis 1.1. In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth: and ver. 2.
The Spirit of God moved upon the water* and ver. 26 Let us make man Genesis 3 22.
etc. Behold, the man is become as one of us Psalm. 33.6. By the word of the Lord
the heaven^ were made, and by the breath of his mouth, all the host thereof. 2.
Sam. 23.2 The Spirit of the Lord spoke in me, and his word was in my tongue,
Esaias. 6 3. holy, holy, holy, Lord of host? Esaias 63.9. The Angel of his
countenance, (to wit of God the Father) saved them: and ver. 10. They rebelled
and grieved his holy Spirit. Which testimonies, though the obstinate Jews go
about to elude, yet they will content sober Christian minds.

IV. But there are cleerer Testimonies in the New Testament.

Matthew. 3.16. And the heavens were opened to him (to wit to Christ) And he saw
the Holy Gh^st descending and coming upon him* and ver. 17 And behold a voice
came from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son in whom I am we^ pleased.
Matthew. 28 19, Baptize them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. ^oh.
4.16. I will ask the Father, and he will send you another Comfo^ter* and* 15.26
^hen the Comforter shall come, w^om I will send to you from the Father. 2. Co^.
13.14* The Grace of our Lord Ie^us Christ, and the love of God, and communion
of the Holy Ghost be with you all. 1 John 5.7. There are three which bear
witness in heaven, the Father, the word, and the Holy Spirit.

V. To these may be added the Testimonies which prove the Divinity of the Son
and Holy Ghost. 1. From their Names, 2. From their Properties. 3. From their
works. 4. From their Divine Honors.

1. The Diety of the Son is proved: I. From his Divine Names.

In the old Testament, The A^gel of the covenant, Malach. 3.1. He who
oftentimes appeared to the Fathers to foreshew his incarnation, was the Son of
God, and is every where called Jehovah and God. Genesis 16.13 and. 18 1. and 32
1.9 (which place may be compared with Hosea 12.6.) Ex. 3.15. Ios. 6.2. Zac.
2.1^. and 3.1, 2.

But for the Testimonies of the New Testament, they are very clear. Joh. 1.
ver. 1 And the word was God, and 17.3. This is life eternal, to know thee the
only true God, and whom thou have sent, Jesus Christ. Joh 20 31. but these
things are written, that you may believe, that Jesus is the Christ the Son of
God. Act. 20.28. God redeemed the Church with his own blood Romans 9.5. God
blessed for ever. Tit. 2.31. The mighty God. Such phrases are frequent in the
Revelation.

II. From the Divine Properties, and 1. From Eternity Joh 8.58. Before Abraham
was I am. Rev 1.8. I am Alpha and Omega, which was, which is, and which is to
come.

2. From his Omniscience. Joh. 2. ver. 24, 25. He knew all men, and needed not
that any should testify of man, for he knew what was in man.

3. From his Omnipresence. Matthew. 28.20. I will be with you to the end of the
world.

4. From his Omnipotency. Joh. 5. ver. 19. Whatsoever the Father does, that
likewise does the Son. Heb. 1.3. He supporteth all things by the word of his
power.




III. From his Divine Works

Joh. 14.11. Believe that the Father is in me, and I in the Father; if not, at
least believe for the works sake.

IV. From Divine Honor.

We must believe in him, Joh. 3.16. We must baptize in his Name, Matthew. 28.19.
at his Name every knee shall bow, Phil. 2.10.

2. The Divinity of the Holy Ghost is proved, I. From his name God. Act. 5.3.
Then Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled thy heart to lie against the
Holy Ghost? and ver. 4. Thou have not lied against man, but against God.

II. From his Properties, and 1 From his Eternity.

Genesis 1.2. The Spirit moved upon the waters.

2 From his Omnipresence.

Psalm. 139.7. Whither shall I go from thy Spirit.

3 From his Omniscience.

1 Cor. 2.10. The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.

3. From his Omnipotency.

Which is known by his works.

III. From his Divine works, and 1 From the Creation of all things.

Genesis 12. Psalm. 33.6. Job* 26.13. and 33.4.

2 From the conservation of all things.

Genesis 1.2. He moved on the waters; a simile taken from a H^n, siting on her
Chickens and cherishing them.

3* From sending, and anointing of Christ.

E^y. 61.1. The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me.

4. From the Gifts of Tongues and Miracles.

1. Cor. 12.4. There (...) diverse gifts, but the same Spirit.

IV. From his Divine Honors.

1. We must believe in him, according to the Creed. 2. We must baptize in his
Name, Matthew. 28.19. To him we must direct our prayers, 2 Cor. 13.13 Rev. 1.4.
Where are said to be seven Spirits, not in number, but in the diversities of
gifts; whence the antici^nt Church was wont to sing. Thou sevenfold Spirit in
respect of gifts.

V, The difference of the persons, is seen in the Order, Properties, and manner
of Working: they differ in Order, because the Father is the first, the Son the
second, and Holy Ghost the third person: they differ in properties, because the
Father is from himself, not only by reason of his essence, but also of his
personality. The Son is A. R. The Son is from the Father, not as an effect from
the cause, for that were to infer a priority; 2. A dependency; 3. A diversity
of substances in the Trinity: but he is from the Father, as the understanding
is from the soul, the River from the spring, or the thing proceeding from its
original
from the Father; the Holy Ghost is from the Father, and the Son, They differ
in manner of working, because the Father works from himself, the Son from the
Father, the Holy Ghost from both.

VI. The Trinity of the Persons takes not away the unity of the essence: for
there are three persons, but one God.

Deuteronomy. 6.4. Hearken Israel, the Lo^d our God is one God, 1 Cor. 8.4. To have
one God the Fa^he^, from whom, are all things, and we in him; and one Lord
Jesus Christ by whom are all things, and we through him, Ephesians. 4.6. There is one
God and Father of all, 1 Timothy 2.5 There is one God and one Mediator between God
and man, the man Christ Jesus, 1 John 5.7. and these three are one.

VII. Hence the Word God is sometimes taken essentially, for the whole Trinity;
and sometimes hypostatically, for one of the persons.

Act. 20.28. God ha^h purchased the Church by his own blood Here the Name of
God is hypostatically spoken of the Son.

VIII. The unity of the three persons in the Trinity consists, 1. (...) In
the identity of substance. 2 (...), In equality. 3. (...). In coherence or
cohabitation.

IX. The identity of substance is, by which the three persons being
co-essential or of the same essence, do exist.

For they are not of a like essence, nor of an essence unlike, nor of a
d^fferent essence; nor of the same specifical essence.

X- Equality is that by which the three Persons of the Deity are equal in
essence, properties, essential actions, glory and honor; whence the Son and
Holy Ghost are no less then the Father, God of themselves, life of themselves,
and Justice of themselves.

XI. Coherence or cohabitation is that by which the persons are most straightly
united, that the one remains in and with the other.

Joh. 14.11. Believe me, that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.

CHAP. III. Concerning the Works of GOD, and the Decrees of GOD in general.
THus God has been considered in himself; Now he is to be considered in his
works: which works are either Essential, or Personal, those are essentials,
which are common to the whole Trinity; but the personal are those which are
proper to each person. Both these, as well essential as personal, are either to
internal, or external objects. The internal are they, which have no reference
to any object without God;

As understanding by which God understands himself; the Generation of the
Son, the Production of the Holy Ghost.

Gods external work is that, which has reference to some object without the
Trinity.

Such are Predestination, Creation, and the like, which have relation to
Creatures as objects without God.

The RULES.
I. One and the same external work in a different consideration, is both
personal and essential.

So the incarnation of Christ, in respect of inchoation or initiation* is the
essential work of the whole Trinity; but in respect of bounds or term^nation,
it is the personal work of the Son alone: for though the Father and Holy Ghost
are the cause of Christ's incarnation, yet the Son only was incarnate Even so,
although Creation, Redemption, Sanctification are essential works of the whole
Trinity, yet in another respect they are called personal: For the Father is
called Creator, because he is the Fountain both of the Trinity, and of
operation; for the Son and Holy Ghost work from the Father. The Son is called
Redeemer, because having man's nature he performed the work of Redemption: But
the Holy Ghost is called the Sanct^fier, because he is sent from Christ as a
Sanctifier and Comforter.

II. The external Operations are indivisible, or common to all the persons.

This axiom follows upon the former: for as the essence is common to all the
Persons, so are lik^wise the essential operations.

II Yet every operation remains one and the same, if we consider the essential.
Original from which it proceeds, the Act by which it is effected, and the
effect it self which is produced

Gods operations which have reference to outward objects, are either immanent
and internal, or transient and external.

The immanent or internal operations are they which are effected within the
essence of God, to which sort belong Gods decrees.

The RULES.
I. Every operation which has relation to outward objects is not therefore an
external operation.

For the decrees of God are such kind of operations, so far forth as they have
reference to the creatures or any thing without God; yet they are internal
operations, in that they remain w^thin Gods very essence.

II Gods immanent or internal works, are not things different from Gods essence.

For whatsoever is in God, is God, as we have already showed out of the
simplicity of the Di^vine essence: and as in God, essence and actual being are
not different, so in him will, and willingness are not different really.

Gods decree is the internal action of the Divine will, by which he has
determined from eternity most freely and certainly of those things which in
time are to be effected

The RULES
I This is called his Act. 2.23.
(...), Determined purpose, Act. 4.28.
(...), The hand and counsel of God; Ephesians. 1.9. N^w this is called his Eternal
providence, that it may be distinguished from Actual providence, which is
nothing else but the execution of Gods decrees.
(...), The good pleasure of God, and Gods eternal providence.

II. This is called, the Will of God, o^ The will of his good pleasure.

Indeed the Decree is the very will of God; yet for our better understanding,
the Will is considred as the cause efficient, the Decree is the effect, Now
whereas this word Will is taken diversely, it is diverse ways distinguished by
Divines, to wit, into the will of his good pleasure, and the will of the sign;
into an antecedent, and consequent; into absolute, and conditional; into
secret, and revealed. But these are not real distributions of the Divine will,
but distinctions only of the name: For to speak properly, there is in God but
one only will, which is ^alled the will of his good pleasure, because out of
his most free good pleasure he has decreed what shall be done: It is called
also his antecedent will; because it had existence before any creature, and
from eternity with God it was established: It is named also absolute, because
it depends upon Gods good pleasure, and not from the things which are done in
time. Lastly it is called secret, because in respect of priority it is known
neither to men nor Angels. But these things are improperly styled by the name
of Divine Will, which are comprehended in that ordinary verse:

Praecipit, and prohibet, promittit, consulit. implet:

Commands, forbids, promises, consulteth, fulfill^th.

A. R. The School men take Gods antecedent will in another sense, for his
velle^ty, and they call it conditional; they make his con^equent will absolute,
and which is always fulfilled, the other not always.
For as the Magistrates com^ands are called his will; so the name of will is
attr^buted to precepts, prohibitions, promises, to effects also and events. And
this is it which is called the will of the sign, because it sign^fieth what is
acceptable to God, and what he would have done by u^. It is also called his
consequent will, because it follows that eternal antecedent will: And it is a
conditional will, because Gods precepts, prohib^tions, con mi. nations, and
promises, have the condition of obedience and disobedience annexed. Lastly his
revealed will, because it is daily set forth in God's word. This distinction of
the will is duly to observed, left we should imagine that there are in God
either really different, or contrary wills.

III. What things are done against the will of God are not done besides his
will.

For many things may be done against his revealed will, which notwithstanding,
are consistent with his sec^et will, or will of his good pleasure. God by his
revealed will desired not man's fall, but most severely forbad it, yet he did
will and decree the same, by the will of his good pleasure, as it was a means
for mani^estation of his glory.

IV. Therefore by the decree and will of God, good and evil comes to pass;
good by efficiency, Evil by permission.

V. Yet the decree or will of God is not the cause of evil or sin: although
what God has decreed, necessarily comes to pass.

For when evil is decreed by Gods will, not effecting, but permitting it; this
decree of God is not the cause of evil; neither again is the will of God the
cause of evil; because his decrees are without repentance and unavoidable; for
they come not to pass by the necessity of coaction, b^t by the necessity of A.
R. Gods will is immutable, because his substance is unchangeable, and his
knowledge unalterable: therefore God changes not his w^ll, though he wills
change in the creatures; neither can God will evil, because it is not
appetible, and it is repugnant to his nature and goodness.
immutability.

VI. The necessity of Gods decrees, takes not away the liberty of the rational
creature.

The reason i^ because there is no necessity of co^ctions but of immu^ability.
The fall of Adam, if we look upon Gods decree, came to pass necessarily: In
the mean while Adam sinned freely, being neither commanded, nor constrained,
nor fo^ced or moved by God, but rather most severely admon^shed that he should
not sin.

VII. Nor does this Necessity take away Contingencie in the second causes.

For many things are not contingent in respect of the second causes, which in
regard of Gods decree come to pass necessarily.

VI^I. No moving or impulsive cause can be given of Gods decree, except Gods
most free will and good pleasure.

XI. The chief end of Gods decree, is his own glory.

X. Gods decree in it self is one and most simple; neither is there priority or
posteriority in it.

XI. But in respect of the things which are decreed, is so distinguished, that
in what manner or order they come to pass, God is said to decree them that
they should thus come to pass.

These are idle questions: whether God decreed this, or that first* Whether he
first ordained the end, or the means? For whereas the decree of God in it self
is one and a most simple action, there is neither priority nor posteriority in
it, but it is distingu^shed only in regard of the things which are decreed; in
which respect we say, that God, 1. Decreed to create man. 2. To bestow his
Image upon him, but so that it might be lost. 3. To permit his fall 4. Of those
who were to fall, some he decreed to leave to themselves, and others he
appointed to raise, and to save them eternally.

CHAP. IV. Of Predestination.
GOD's Decree, in respect of the Creatures, is either general or special. The
general Decree is that by which he appointed to declare the glory of his power,
wisdom and goodness, in the creation and conservation of all things.

The special Decree, called Predestination, is that by which he appointed to
manifest the glory of his grace, mercy, and justice, in the Election and
Reprobation of the reasonable Creatures.

The RULE.
I. Although Predestination in the mind of God be one and a most simple act,
yet by reason of the weakness of our understanding it is distinguished into
that Predestination which decrees the end, and that which decrees the means.

II. He that is predestinate to the end, is predestinate also to the means.

Predestination is either of Angels, or of men.

The Predestination of Angels is that by which God appointed to save etenally
some of them in their first happiness, and that in Christ their head: but to
leave others to themselves, and to punish them eternally for deserting their
station voluntarily; and this for the manifestation of the glory of his grace
and justice.

The Predestination is a part of divine providence, differing in this, that
Providence has respect to a natural end, Predestination to a supernatural: man
therefore being subject to Providence, is also subject to Predestination.
Predestination of men is that by which God appointed, out of the race of
mankind created to his Image, but falling into sin voluntarily, to save some
through Christ eternally, but others being left to themselves in their own
misery, to damn eternally, and that for the manifestation of the glory of his
mercy and Justice.

The parts then of this decree are two, Election and Reprobation.

The RULES.
I. Predestination is a decree, partly absolute, partly not.

II. It is absolute, in respect of the efficient impulsive Cause, which neither
is Faith in those which were to be elected, nor sin in those which were to be
reprobated, but Gods most free will.

Foreseen Faith or Holiness, is not the cause of Election; for man was not
elected, because he was to believe; but therefore he believes, because he was
elected. Act. 13.28* And they believed, so many as were ordained to life
eternal. Neither are we elected, because we were to be holy, but that we might
be holy and unblamable before him through love, Ephesians. 1.4. Neither is foreseen
sm^the cause of Reprobation, for so we should be al reprobates, but that God
according to his most free good pleasure has done what he did, is manifest by
that Luke 12.23. It is your Fathers pleasure to give you a Kingdom* and Romans
9.16. I will have mercy, on whom I will have mercy and ver. 18. Therefore he
will show mercy on whom he will, and whom he wills he hardens.

III. It is not absolute, if we consider the matter or object, and the means by
which he puts this decree in execution.

VI. For the matter or object of election and reprobation, is not man
considered absolutely, but as he was to fall into sin of his own accord.

The reasons are most evident, because the decrees of manifesting mercy, wrath
or justice, presupposes sin; for there can be no mercy, but toward him that
is in misery; and there can be no justice o^ just indignation, but toward him
that is a sinner.

2. But because that only can be reprobated, which may be reprobated; but man
is reprobable, or may be reprobated, not as by God he was created, but as Satan
he was defaced.

V. Sin therefore is not the impulsive cause of Reprobation, but a^ necessary
condition of the matter or object; for though it be not the cause of
reprobation, yet it is the cause of reprobability, or why man should be
reprobated.

For Reprobation and rep^obability, diffe^ as the act and possib^lity. All men
are reprobable or (...) liable to R^probation for sin; but all are not
therefore actual Reprobates.

VI Reprobation then presupposes, 1 The decree of man's Creation. Of the
donation of Gods Image upon him, which Image was to be lost. 3. Of the
permission of man's fall.

VII. But the means of execution are so ordered, that albeit God works most
freely and according to his good pleasure- yet neither have the Elect any just
cause to brag, nor the Reprobate to complain; for to those undeserved grace was
bestowed, and on these deserved punishment is inflicted.

VIII. These are different questions. 1. By what right God reprobates man,
which is his Creature? 2. Why did he not choose all, but some, and reprobate
others? 3. Why did he choose this man, to wit, Peter, and reprobate that man,
to wit, Judas? To the first, we answer from the material cause in that Adam, as
he was to fall, was liable to reprobation. To the second we answer from the
end, because God was willing to manifest the Glory of his mercy and justice.
But to the third, from the cause impulsive, because so it pleased him.

To use the Apostles simile: If it be demanded why the Potter out of the same
lump maks Vessels of such different conditions? it is answered from the end,
because there be different uses of these Vessels in the house. If again it be
demanded, why out of one piece of the lump a Vessel of honor is made and out
of the other a Vessel to dishonor; it is answered from the cause impulsive,
because it so pleased the Potter.

IX. Christ is to be considered either as God, or as God and man the Mediator.
In the former respect, he is with the Father and Holy Ghost the efficient cause
of our election* but in the latter respect, he is the means of execution
thereof.

We are then said to be elected in Christ, Ephesians. 1.4, 5. because by him we were
to be saved, The decree of saving us, is called Predestination to the end; but
the decree of bestowing Christ upon us as our Head; is named Predestination to
the Means.

X. Although these words of Predestination, Prescience, and Predetermination,
are sometime taken for the same; yet for understandings sake they may be thus
distinguished. Predestination signifies the very purpose of God to save us:
Prescience, that free bounty by which he acknowledges us for his own, but
Predetermination imports Predestination as it has reference to Christ, and the
other means of salvation.

Romans 8.28, 29. But we know, that to those who love God, all things work
together for their good; to those I say who are called of his purpose for whom
he fore-knew, those he predestined, that they might be confo^mable to the
image of his Son, etc.

XI. They are altogether A. R. Predestination is a part of Providence, so is
Reprobation: For as God by his Providence has ordained some to life eternal,
so by that same providence he was to suffer some to fall away from that
happiness.
foolish, who acknowledge Election, and deny Reprobation.

Because the Scripture teaches that there is Reprobation as well a^ Election,
Esa. 41.9. I have chosen thee, and not cast thee away. Mal. 1.2. Jacob have I
loved, and I have hated Esau. Romans 9.18. He will have mercy on whom he will and
whom he will he hardens. Romans 11.7. The election has obtained it and the
rest have been hardened. 1 Thessalonians. 5.9. God has not appointed us to wrath, but
to salvation. 2 Timothy 2.20. Vessels to honor, and to dishonor. Jude v. 4. For
there are certain men crept in, which were before of old ordained to
condemnation^

XII. As Christ is the cause not A. R. Christ is the efficient cause of
Electi^n, as he is God equal with the Father; He is the meritorious cause, as
he became our Mediator As head of the Church, he is also the cause of Election.
Joh. 13.18. I know whom I have chosen. and ^oh. 15.16. I have chosen you. In
respect of his ^ctive and passive obedience, he is (...), the outward moving
cause. And if he be the cause of salvation, he must needs be the cause of
election, on which salvation depends; Causa causae, est causa causati.

But beeause we are said to be elected in him, as he b^came our Surety, he is
called the medium or mean of election, rather than the cause. As he is God, we
are elected by him; as Mediator, in him. As God, he is the principal ^fficient;
as Mediator, the secondary or mean of election.


of Election, but of Salvation so infidelity is the cause not of Reprobation,
but of Damnation.

Damnation differs from Reprobation, as the means of Execution from the Decree.

XIII. Damnation is not the end of Reprobation, but the manifestation of the
glory of Gods justice.

Therefore to say, that man was created, that he might be damned, is to say
amiss; for damnation is not the end, but the means of execution, of which m^n
by his voluntary disobed^ence has made himself guilty.

XIV For und^rstandings sake, two ^cts are made of Reprobation* to wit; The
denial of undeserved grace, which is called Preterition, and the ordaining to
d^serve punishment, which is called predamnation.

XV. In the trial of our election we must proceed analytically, or by the way
of resolution, from the means of Execution to the decree, beginning from our
Sanctification.

Thus syllogistically: whosoever feels in himself the gift of sanctification by
which we die to sin, and live to righteousness; he is justified called, or
endowed with true faith, and is elected. But by the grace of God I feel this:
therefore I am justified, called, and elected.

XVI. But this is a diabolical argument. If I am elected, there is no need of
good works; if I be a Reprobate, good works are needless.

For first, it is not the part of a Christian to say, Either I am elected or
reprobated; but rather to make trial of his faith as the means of election. 2
Cor. 13.5.6. Prove your selves whether you are in the faith, examine your
selves; know you not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except
you be reprobates? But I trust that you shall know that we are not reprobates.
2. This syllogism disjoyns things subordinate, and conjoyns things in
consistent: For good works are subordinate, and not to be separated from
election; for they are the means of its execution, and of our assurance
thereof: But to be a reprobate, and to do good works, are things inconsistent.

CHAP. V. Of the Creation.
HItherto of God's internal works, His external are these, which are without
the essence of God; and these are two, to wit, the Creation, and the
Government, or Gods actual providence.

Creation is that, by which God produced the world and the things therein,
partly out of nothing, and partly out of matter, unapt naturally for that
production for the manifestation of the glory of his power, wisdom, and
goodness.

The History of the Creation is ^xtant in Genesis, c. 1. and 2*

The RULES.
I. Creation is not onley a production of something out of nothing, but also
out of matter altogether unapt for such production naturally.

II. The work and honor of Creation belongs to God alone, and not to Angels,
or any other creature A. R. The reason is, because an infinite power is
required to produce things out of nothing. 2* Because en^ity or being (...) an
universal effect, and therefore must be produced by an universal cause, which
only is God, who created, that is, gave simply being to the creature.


III. Creation is a transition from the Possibility to the Act: not of the
Creator, but of the Creature.

IV. That possibility is not private, but negative.

Because the matter of creation is naturally unapt to that which is created out
of it. For example, there was no aptitude or disposition, in dust, to man's body
which was so artificially and miraculously produced thence.

V. There was no accession of perfection in God, by creating the World* neither
did he create it, that he might be bettered or perfected by it, but that his
goodness might be communicated to the creature.

VI^ Creation is either of the Species with all the Individuals; so the Angels,
Stars, Elements were created together, Or of the Species with some Individuals
only, having an innate power of propagation.

VII. A more particular knowledge of the Creatures we leave to Natural
Philosophers, it shall suffice in this place, to handle them according to each
Days production.

VIII The first day of the Creation is famous for three works.

1. For the production of Angels, with highest Heaven, called the Heavens of
the blessed.

2. For the production of this visible world, which was not altogether
destitute of form, but of perfection, separation, and beauty, which by degrees
then it received.

3. For sending in of the primitive Light; which was neither the Elementary
fire nor a bright Cloud, nor any other body, but a Quality sent into the air by
God, who is that inaccessible light. This created quality of Light was
afterward the fourth day placed in the Stars.

IX. The second day the Firmament was created, or the Aerial heaven, which by
its lower part separates the waters above, that is the ^louds; from the waters
beneath, that is the Sea.

X. The third day, God 1. separated the inferior waters which as yet covered
the earth, and gathered them into certain channels, that the rest of the earth
called dry land, might afford a commodious habitation for man and beast. 2. He
gave to the earth a fructifying power to produce herbs and plants, without the
h^lp of seed or sun.

XI. The fourth day, the Stars and great Luminaries were placed in heaven,
whose motion proceeds not from a soul, or any assistant intelligence, as the
Philosophers affirm, but from that power which God gave them in the beginning;
no otherways than the earth by its innate power stands immovable.

XII. There is a threefold use of the Stars. 1. To distinguish the day and
night: 2. To note the times and seasons of the year: 3. To impart their virtue
to inferior bodies.

XIII. The fifth day, were made the Birds, Fishes, and creeping things.

XIV. The sixth day, after the earthly Creatures were produced, and this whole
Universe as a large house was furnished with all kind of furniture, Man at
last was created

Of all these Creatures, Men and Angels are chiefly considered in Divinity,
because on them God bestowed his Image.

The RULES.
1. Although the whole World be the Looking-glass of Gods power, wisdom* and
bounty; yet properly Gods Image is attributed to Angels and Men only.

2. Gods Image does partly consist in natural gifts, to wit, in the invisible
and simple substance of Angels and Men's souls, in their life, understanding,
will, and immortality; partly in supernatural gifts, to wit, in their primitive
blessedness, in the uprightness of their intellect and will, and in their
majesty and dominion over the other creatures.

Angels are intelligent Creatures void of bodies.

The RULES.
I Angels are not accidents, nor qualities, but true substances.

II Angels are void of bodies, A. R. If the Angels were corporeal, the world
were imperfect: because there would be wanting incorporeal creatures. 2 God
made men and Angels to his own image, which consists not only in will and
understanding, but also in immateriality and immortality.
and are not subject to destruction.

III. The bodies in which the Angels appeared were not mere apparitions, nor
yet united to them hypostatically, but were freely assumed to perform some
service in.

IV. Angels are in a place not by way of circumscription: but by way of
definition.

V. Angels cannot be together in many places.

VI Angels truly move from place to place.

Man is a creature, whose body originally was formed of earth, but afterward
is propagated of seed by traduction, consisting of a reasonable soul, infused
into him by God immediately.

Here we disallow not the Philosophers definition, by which they call man a
reasonable creature, but we describe man in the Divinity-School more fitly for
our purpose, as we have now described him.

The RULES.
I. There Is a threefold miraculous production of man's body mentioned in
Scripture: the first was of the dust of the earth, without Father and Mother;
the second production was out of Adam's rib, without a Mother; the third was of
the blood of the Virgin, without a Father.

II. The soul of man is not propagated of seed by traduction, but is
immediately created by God, and infused into the body.

Of man's creation, Moses writes thus, Genesis 2. ver. 7. The Lord breathed into
his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul. In this place
three things are mentioned: 1. The immediate Creation of the soul, for it is
called the breath of God. 2. His breathing, for he says, He breathed into his
nostrils. 3. The personal union of body and soul, in these words And he was
made a living soul, metonymically, that is a living sensitive creature. But
that the souls now are immediately created by God and infused into the body* is
proved by these subsequent Reasons. 1. Because otherwise our souls should have
another original than Adam's had; for ours must proceed of some pre-excistent
matter, where as Adam's proceeded of none. Neither will that objection hold
concerning the d^fferent way or reason of generation, and creation; for nothing
is generated of matter, but what in the beginning was created of matter. 2.
Because the soul of Christ was not formed of seed by traduction, for he was
conceived not by the the help of man, but by the operation of the holy Ghost of
the blessed Virgins blood. 3. Because the Scripture, when it speaks of the
original of our souls, it speaks as of a work of Creation, not of nature, Job.
33.4. The spirit of God has made me: and the breath of the Almighty has given
me life. Zac. 12.1. The Lord stretches out the heavens, and lays the
foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him; where it is
plain that this is reckoned among the works of Creation. 4. Such is man's
generation, as his dissolution is, but man's dissolution is, that his body
returns to dust, and his spirit to God that gave it, Eccl. 127. Whereas then
in man's dissolution, the spirit returns immediately to God, doubtless it was
immediately formed by him. 5 Because the Scripture does plainly distinguish
between the parts of bodies and spirits, Heb. 12.9.6. Because the soul is
indivisible into parts, therefore cannot be produced but of nothing. 7. Because
if it were generated by traduction, either it must be generated of a soul, or
of a body, or of a soul and body together: but it is not generated of a soul,
A. R. The soul could not be produced out of any preexistent matter; neither
corporeal, because it is not a body, nor incorporal, because spirits, and
incorporeal substances admit no change or transmutation.
because of that which is incorruptible nothing can be generated; not of a body,
because it is not corporeal; not of a body and soul together, because so it
should be partly corporeal, partly incorporeal* seeing then it is produced of
nothing, it must be produced by God alone, whose alone property it is to make
things of nothing.

III. These physical Axioms, like begets like, and, Man begets man; remain
true also in this case: both because man begets man, a person begets a person;
as also because by the work of the Parents the body is begot, as it were the
subject of the soul, and so is united to the soul, which is infused by God, and
thus the whole man is brought into this World by generation.

It Is true, that man is the efficient cause of man, but not according to all
his parts: for as he is said to kill a man, that kills only his body; so man is
said to beget man, though he begets not the soul. Neither again is man in this
respect nobler than other living creatures: whereas rather for this very cause,
man's generation is more excellent, in that Gods immediate operation concurs
with natures work.

IV. Man's soul is immortal; not simply, as though God could not annhilate it,
but by Gods ordination, and that it cannot be destroyed by second causes.

V. The faculties of the soul are real^y different from the soul, as qualities
or proper accidents from their subject.

The reason of this is taken from the event, because the essence of the soul
remains entire, when the faculties are shaken and weakened.

VI. The souls faculties are either merely organical, as the vegitive and
sensitive faculty, or are such only in part and for a time, as the
understanding and will; the former appears not when the body is corrupted; but
these without the help of the body can exercise themselves, and appear when the
body is destroyed.

VII Liberty from coaction, is an essential property of the will.

Otherways the will were no will.

CHAP. VI. of Gods actual Providence.
GOd's actual Providence, is that by which not only he preserves his
creatures, but also according to his great wisdom, goodness, power, justice,
and mercy, he governs all things.

The RULES
I To deny A. R. For he could not be God, if he did not order things to their
end: but this is Providence. 2. He were not God, if he were not good: but this
is seen as well in the ordering, as in the creating of the world. 3. He were
not God, if he were not prudent: but Providence is the chief part of prudence.
this Providence, is to deny God himself.

II. Actual Providence differs from eternal, as the execution from the Decrees.

III. As in God's eternal ^rovidence, the will of his good pleasure; so in
this, his revealed will is chiefly seen.

IV. Providence does not only consist in knowledge, but also in the Government
of all things both great and small.

V. Gods providence takes not away, but establishes the second causes.

VI. What A. R. The world were not perfect, if all things we^e necessary,
nothing contingent; therefore God would have contingencies to depend from
con^ingent causes, and necessities from causes necessary; therefore what falls
out necessarily, is because God has so disposed it.
things are contingent in respect of the second causes, are necessary in
respect of Gods providence; but this necessity is of immutability, not of
coaction,

VII. Gods providence is far different from the Stoics fatal necessity.

For the Stoical fate ties God to the connection of seconda^y causes: but the
Christian fate makes a subordination of the second cause to Gods most free will
of which he makes use voluntarily, not of necessity, out of indulgence, rather
then indigence.

VIII. By Gods Providence both good and evil are governed.

IX. Good things are ruled by an efficacious action or effectual working, to
which belong the preventing, concomitant, and subsequent assistance of Divine
power.

X. Evil things are ruled by an actual permission, and so they are permitted,
directed, and determined

XI. Gods Providence remains, ordered and undefiled, even in those actions
that are disordered and sinful.

For in evil actions two things are observable; the action it self, and the
irregularity thereof. The action it self, as all natural motions, is performed
by Gods effectual operation; but the irregularity or vitiosity, comes to pass
by Gods actual permission. For sin is ordered, 1. By permitting it* 2. By
determining and containing it within its bounds. 3. By directing it to a good
issue. Now God cannot be said to be author of sin by any of these ways. Not by
producing the matter of it, or the natural action: for as there is one cause of
the horses motion, another of his halting; even so it is one thing to be the
cause of the action, and another thing to be the cause of the adhering
vitiosity. Not by permitting the evil action, because God is not forced by any
law to hinder sin. Not by determining it; for as he who quenches a f^^e that it
may not spread further, is not the cause of the fire; so he that sets bounds
to sin, is not the cause of sin. Not by directing it to a good end; for as it
is a main skill to prepare wholesome Medicines out of venomous creatures; so it
is the glory of God to create light out of darkness, and good out of evil:
Hence it is apparent how frivolous their device is, who that they might
vindicate God from any contagion of sin, they fly to a bare and idle
permi^sion of sin.

XII. Though the Scripture ascribes many times the same action and the same
work to God, to the devil, and to wicked men, yet sin cannot be in any wise
imputed to God.

In this case we must not have rec^u^se to a bare permission, but we must give
an estimate of these actions according to their scope and end: for in one and
the same action, God has one purpose, Satan another, and wicked men another.
Job's affliction is imputed to God; God gave, says Job, and God has taken;
the same is ascribed to Satan, to the Sabaeans also, and Chaldeans: but
according to the end we must judge of each of them; ^t was Satan's purpose to
make Job despair: It was the Chaldeans intent and Sabeans, to enrich themselves
by plundring that holy man: but God determined to try and make manifest the
faith of his servant. So in the crucifying of Christ, it was Pilates purpose to
continue in the favor of Caesar, and of the Jews: the Jews drift was to
satisfy their desire with hatred and revenge; but Gods end was to redeem
mankind. Hence they are said to do nothing, but what the hand and counsel of
God had determined, Act 4.28.

XIII. The hardening of the wicked is ascribed to God as a most just Judgment;
so as God can neither be blamed as faulty, nor can the wicked be axcused.

The wicked are in this inexcusable, because God only hardens those who
harden themselves; neither does he harden the soft hearted, but in his just
Judgment he increases the hardness of them who were hardened before. Now they
hardened themselves, by abusing those graces which should have softened them. I.
Gods long suffering. Romans 2.4, 5. Or d^spi^est thou the riches of his bounty,
patience, and long suffering not knowing that the bountifulness of God leads
thee to repentance? But thou after thy hardness, and heart that cannot repent,
heapest unto thy self wrath. II. Gods Word, 2. Cor. 2, 15. For we are unto God
the sweet savor of Christ in them that are saved, and in them which perish; to
the one we are the savor of death unto death, to the other the savor of life
unto life III. Gods correction and rod, by which as an Anvil they are made
harder. Ier. 5.3. Thou have stricken them, but they have not sorrowed* thou
have consumed them, but they have refused to receive correction; they have made
their faces harder then a stone, and have refused to return. For this reason
then are they most justly hardened by God, who harden themselves who so often
said of Pharaoh, I will hold, I will make obstinate, I will harden his heart,
For not only does he harden by permission, but also, 1. By letting loose the
bridle with which he held in their exorbitant lusts, Romans 1.24. He dilivered
them up to their own lust, and v. 28. God gave them up to a reprobate mind. II.
By delivering them to Satan as to a Hangman. 1 King. 22.21.22 And there came
forth a Spirit who stood before the Lord, and said, I will persuade him (to wit
Achab) and the Lord said to him where with? And he said, I will go forth, and I
will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said thou shall
persuade him, and prevail also: go forth and do so. As therefore when the
Magistrate delivers over to the Hangman a guilty person to be punished; he is
neither the cause of his wickedness, nor of his destruction: even so when God
gives up wicked men to Satan; neither is the cause of their wickedness, nor of
their ruin to be imputed to God.

CHAP. VII Of the Governmemt of Angels.
GOd's actual Providence does chiefly appear in the government of Angels and
men: This government is either of good Angels, or of bad; the government of
good Angels is that whereby God has established them in their original
integrity and happiness in his Son, as in their head, to the praise of the
glory of his grace*

The RULES.
I. The good Angels of their own nature were as apt to fall, as the bad.

II. Therefore they ought to ascribe not to themselves, but to the grace of God
the Father, and to the Son as to their head, their establishment or
confirmation in goodness.

III. The Son of God is the head of the Angels, not by right of redemption, but
of creation, and of that gracious Union with God.

For they could not be endowed with the Image of God, nor be adopted unto Sons,
but only in the Son of God, Who is the Image of God made visible, and the
firstborn of every creature, Col. 1.15.

IV. That Angel who so often appeared to the Fathers in the shape of man, as a
Prologue or Forerunner of his Incarnation, was not a created Angel, but the
very Son of God.

Genesis 18.13. The Lord said to Abraham, why does Sarah laugh? Genesis 32 28. the
Angel said to Jacob, Thou have prevayled with an Angel; which is thus
explained, Hos. 12.4* He prevailed with God Jos. 5.14. That man whom Iosuah
saw, said, I am as a Captain of the host of the Lord: and v. 15. And the
Captain of the Lords host said to Joshua. See Zach. 1. v. 2, 3.

V. Although there is no ataxie or confusion among the Angels, yet it is not to
be found in Scripture that they have any prince or other head over them than
the Son of God, by Michael the Archangel, the Son of God is rightly understood.

For he is set in opposition to the Devil as to the head of evil Angels. Rev.
12.7. Michael and his Angels fought against the Dragon: ver. 10 Now is
salvation in heaven, and the Kingdom of our God and the power of his Christ.

VI The good Angels are ready executors of Gods will, especially in the
praising of God, and preservation of the godly.

VII. We are not carefully to enquire, whether or not particular men, or
provinces are governed by certain Angels.

For out of Scripture it appears, that GOD uses sometimes the Ministry of one
Angel, sometimes of more.

The government of evil Angels, is that whereby God has thrust them out of
Heaven into infernal places and eternal destruction, as voluntary Delinquents,
having forsaken their first integrity, and beeome the enemies of Christ's
Kingdom.

The RULES.
I. Evil Angels are such not by creation, but by their own voluntary defection

II What their first sin was, whether Pride or not, the Scripture does not
specify, yet it is certain that it was not committed without pride.

For pride is joined to every sin that is committed with deliberation.

III. We may more safely with the Apostle, Jude ver 6. call it, a defection
from their first original, and a desertion of their proper habitation.

IV. The evil Angels have a Prince whom the Scripture by way of excellency
calls the Devil, the old Serpent, Satan, and the Dragon, See Rev. 12.9.

V. Whereas the Scripture speaks nothing of the time when the evil Angels fel^,
nor of the number, we ought also in this to be silent.

VI. Their punishment consists partly in the memory of their happiness lost
irrecoverably, partly in the perpetual sense of their misery and torments.

VII. The substance of the evil Angels remained simple, invisible, and immortal.

VIII. There remained also in them no small knowledge, and a sagacity also of
searching out future things, havnig these h^lpes (...). Their natural
knowledge. 2 Their long experimental knowledge 3. Astrology. 4. The knowledge
of Scripture, chiefly of the Prophets. 5. Extraordinary revelation, so often as
God makes use of the service of these torturers A. R. There is in the evil
Angels a twofold knowledge; the one is by nature, which they have not lost at
all; for their nature being simple, admits no diminution; therefore that
knowledge which in them depends from their nature, as their other natural
faculties do, were not lost nor diminished. Hence they knew how to produce
Frogs in Egypt, and do the other wonders that Moses did, only they could not
produce the Lice; not as if they were ignorant of the occult seeds and causes
of such production (for the knowledge of the Lice was not more difficult, than
that of the Froges) but because they were hindered by the power of God. Their
other knowledge is by grace, and that is either speculative, or practical, the
former is not totally lost, but much diminished; for of Gods secrets they know
very little; But the practick knowledge, which is joined with the love of God,
and detestation of evil, is totally lost in them, for such knowledge cannot
consist with obstinate mal^ce* yet as they naturally know God, so they
naturally love him as an Entity, but not morally, as he is the Fountain of all
happiness, of which they know themselves to be eternally deprived.
.

IX. As this their knowledge is far from charity, so it is void of all comfort,
and strikes in them a terror.

Matthew. 8.29. Wha^ have we to do with thee Jesus the Son of God? art thou come
to torment us before our tim^? Jam. 2 19. Thou believe there is one God: thou
do well; the devils also believe and tremble.

X. There remains also in them great power, which they show by removing huge
bodies out of their places, in raising storms, in overthrowing houses and
mountains, in infecting the air and the bodies of creatures with a venomous
breath, in possessing men, in bewitching the outward and inward senses, by
altering and changing the organ or object.

XI. But over the Stars or celestial bodies they have no right or power.

Because to them is granted power to rule in the air only, Ephesians. 2.2.

XII. All their power over inferior things is so limited by Gods providence,
that without his power they can do nothing.

Matthew. 8.31. But the devils besought him saying, if thou cast us out suffer us
to go into the herd of Swine.

XIII. Evil Angels can do wonders, but not work miracles.

Because miracles are works exceeding all power of the creatures.

CHAP. VIII. Of the government of Man, in the state of Innocence.
SUch is the Government of Angels. The government of man is seen in the state
of Innocence, of Misery, of Grace, and of Glory.

The government of man in the state of Innocence, is that by which God made a
Covenant of works with man, promising him eternal happiness, under the
condition of obedience; otherways, eternal death.

The RULES.
I. God made a double Covenant with man, the one of works, the other of Grace;
that before, this after the fall

II. The Covenant of works was confirmed by a double Sacrament, to wit, the
Tree of Life, and the Tree of Knowl^dge of good and evil, both being planted in
the midst of Paradise.

III. They had a double use. 1. That man's obedience might be tried, by using
of the one, and abstaining from the other. 2 That the tree of life might
ratify eternal happiness to those that should obey, but the Tree of knowledge
should signify to the disobedient the loss of the greatest happiness, and the
possession of the greatest misery.

IV Therefore the Tree of life was so called, not from any innate faculty it
had to give life, but from a sacramental signification.

V. Likewise the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil, has this denomination
from signifying the chief good and evil, and from the ev^nt.

For in effect, and by experience, man found out how great that happiness and
good was which he lost, and how great evil and misery he brought upon himself.

VI. The happiness of man being yet in his integrity, consisted chiefly in the
Image of God.

VII. The soul is the principal subject of this Divine Image, the body is the
secondary, so far forth as the operations of the soul do manifest themselves in
it.

VIII. The gifts of Gods Image were partly natural, partly supernatural.

IX. The natural gifts were the simple and invisible substance of the soul,
with its faculties the intellect and will

X. The supernatural gifts were the clearness of the understanding, the liberty
and rectitude of the will, the conformity of the appetites and affections, the
immortality of the whole man, and dominion over the inferior creatures.

XI Such was the clearness of Adam's understanding, that he knew all natural
things, which had a possible existence in the first principles, which are of
themselves known.

An excellent proof of this was showed by Adam, when he gave every creature its
name according to its nature, Genesis 2.20.

XII The will was free, indifferent to good or evil, so that man might have
persevered in uprightness, if he had pleased he received power if he would, but
not wi^^ and power.

There is a fourfold liberty of will according to the fourfold state of man. In
the first man, the will was free to good or evil. In man lapsed, the will is
only free to evil. In man regenerated, or in the state of grace, it is free
from evil to good by the grace of God, but imperfectly. In the state of glory,
i^ shall be free from evi^ to good perfectly. In the state of innocence he
could not sin. A. R. When it is said here, that in the state of misery, man
cannot but sin, is not meant that man is forced to sin, for he is free from
compulsion, both in the state of sin and of grace; but he is not free from
necessity; for freedom and necessity may be together in the same will; so it
shall be in heaven, when we shall necessarily, yet freely will that only which
is good, as the Angels do; and even here the will is necessitated, when it is
determinated by the last act or practical judgment of reason: why then may not
grace in our conversion necessitate, as well as reason determinate? but man by
his voluntary fall has brought the necessity of sinning on himself* So that
with Saint Paul, we do the evil which we would not do, in that we have lost by
the abuse of our free will both our selves and our free will.
In the state of misery he cannot but sin. In the state of grace sin cannot
reign in man. In the state of glory he cannot sin at all.

XIII. The inferior appetites and affections agreed with reason.

XIV. Man even in respect of his body was immortal, but not simply, as though
his body being composed of the elements could not be resolved into its
principles, but by Divine Covenant; not as though it could not die, but because
it had a possibility not to die.

XV. Man's dominion over the inferior creatures was not only entire in respect
of possession, but mild also and gentle in respect of use and execution.

XVI That labor which was enjoined to Adam to keep and dress Paradise, was
not toylsome, but most pleasant.

CHAP. IX. Of the fall of our first parents, the beginning of Man's misery.
SO much concerning the government of Man in the state of innocency^ The
government of Man in the state of misery is, whereby God in his just Judgment
has subjected Man to diverse miseries, who of his own accord fell into sin.
This state of Man consists in sin and in the miseries which follow upon sin.

Sin is a transgression of the Law, or whatsoever is repugnant to Gods Law.

1 John 3.4. Under the name of Law in this place are understood both things
commanded, and things prohibited, in the beginning proposed to man as also the
Law of nature printed in his heart, But concerning the restoring and enlarging
of the Law after the fall* we are to speak in its own place.

The RULES.
I. By sin is meant either the subject of transgression, with the transgression
it self in the concrete, or the transgression alone in the abstract.

II. The definition of sin by thought, word and deed; is too narrow.

For so it is defined by the Pontificians, but as it shall appear afterward,
this definition belongs nothing to original sin.

III. God cannot be called the author of sin without blasphemy.

IV. One and the same thing in a diverse consideration, may be both sin, and the
punishment of sin.

Sin is either primitive, or derivative. Primitive is the disobedience of our
first Parents, whereby they transgressed Gods Commandment concerning the Tree
of Knowledge of good and ev^l.

The RULES.
I. Neither God, nor Gods Decree, nor the denial of special Grace, nor the
permission of sin, nor the stirring up of natural motion, nor finally the
government of that sin, were the causes of Adam and Eves transgression.

Not God; because he most severely prohibited the eating of that fruit. Not his
Decree, because that infers a necessity only of immutability, not of coaction,
neither does it force any man to sin. Not the denial of special Grace, by
which man should continue in his integrity for God was not bound to give that
grace to man, which he gave him; for he received possibility if he would,
although not a Will to that possibility. Not the permission of sin; for he was
not bound to hinder it, as before page 58* Not the stirring up of natural
motion; because motion of it self is not sin. Not the government of his fall;
because to turn evil into good, is rather to be the author of good, than of evil

II. God did both will, and nill the first Sin.

He nilled it so far forth as it was sin; he willed and decreed it, as it was a
means of manifesting his glory, mercy, and justice.

III. The Procatertical or external, A. R. The direct cause of sin was man's
own will; the indirect cause was Satan, by persuasion and suggestion. For no
external thing can necessarily move the will, but the last end only. Satan
may internally work upon the fantasy, by representing forms to it; and upon
the appetite by moving it to passion by means of the spirits and heart; but he
cannot work upon the understanding and will.
cause, was the instinct and persuasion of Satan that subtle Serpent.

IV. The Proegumene or internal cause was the will of man, of it self
indifferent to good or evil, but by Satan's persuasion bent to evil.

V. There be certain degrees of that sin, by which Adam fell from God, not at
once, but by little and little, viz. 1. Incogitancy and curiosity of Evahs
talking with the Serpent, her husband being absent. 2. Incredulity, by which
she began by degrees to distrust God, and to give assent to Satan's lies, who
called in question Gods good will toward man. 3. An inordinate desire to the
forbidden fruit, and an affectation of divine glory. 4. The fact it self. 5.
The seducing of Adam, and an inordinate affectation raised in him also.

VI. If you consider the parts of this sin, you may justly call it the
transgression of the whole Law of Nature.

For man sinned by incredulity, diffidence, ingratitude, idolatry, whereby he
fell from God, and of himself endeavored to make an idol of himself; by
contemning Gods Word, by Rebellion, Homicide, Intemperance, Theft, by laying
hand on that which was another, without the owners consent; by assenting to
false witness; Lastly, by an ambitious affectation of too high an honor, yea,
of that glory which belongs only to God: whence the definition of this sin
by Intemperance, Ambition, or Pride, is too narrow.

VII. Therefore with the blessed Apostle, we rightly call this sin, a
transgression, an offense, and disobedience* Rom 5.14, 18, 19.

VIII. Adam in this business is to be considered not as a private, but as a
public person, and consequently as the Parent, head, and root of all mankind.

IX. Whatsoever therefore he received and lost, he received and lost it for
himself and posterity.

As the head contains Reason both for it self and the members: as a Gentleman
keeps or loses his Copyhold for himself and posterity: so Adam lost that
felicity for himself and his posterity. As out of a venomous root, nothing can
proceed that is wholesome: so all that are come of Adam naturally, are born
guilty of that primitive sin.

X. That primitive sin therefore is not only personal, but natural also;
because by it whole Nature is destroyed, of which also Adams prosterity is held
guilty, to wit, all that are naturally sprung from Adam.

Christ then is excepted from this guilt, for he was born of Adam, but not by
Adam; not by natural generation, but by the virtue of the Holy Ghost.

XI. As therefore the Person infected Nature, so afterward Nature infected the
Persons.

XII. We religiously believe that our first Parents were received into favor
by God.

CHAP. X. Of Original Sin, and Free Will.
THat Sin which is derived from the first or primitive Sin, is either original
or actual; original Sin is that native corruption derived into the whole man
and to the whole race of man naturally descending from Adam, whereby man having
utterly lost his freedom to good, becomes prone to evil.

The RULES.
I. This sin in Scripture is named by way of excellency, Sin, and the Body of
sin Romans 6.6.
, Sinful-sin Romans 7.13.
, Inhabiting-sin Romans 7.17.
, The law of our members Romans 7.23.
, The Old Man Romans 6.6.
, Flesh John. 3.6. Gal. 5.17.
.

II. It is called also Concupiscence.

Rom 7.7. I had not known lust or concupiscence, unless the Law had said, thou
shall not covet or lust, or Jam. 1 14, 15.

III. Therefore the Papists do erroniously exempt it from being a sin,
reckoning it among the works of God.

By the name of Concupiscence is understood, either that natural faculty of
desire which was in man, even before his fall, or that corruption which
naturally adheres to it, as it is in it, in the first act, and as it inclines
man only to evil.

IV. The proximate cause of Original sin, is the guilt of the first sin, in
respect of which it is a most just punishment from God, to wit, a part of that
death which God threatened to man.

V. Although the soul is immediately infused by God into man; yet being united
to the body, it is made guilty presently of the first sin, imparted to the
whole man, and therefore is infected with Original contagion.

VI. Neither for this cause does Original sin cease to be sin, in that it is
not wittingly nor willingly committed; for it is sufficient that the
irregularity of our nature is present, though spontaneousnesse be absent.

VII. From this Original sin (except Christ alone) no man is free, not the
blessed Virgin Mary: Neither is it only in Infants, but it is in the Embryo
scarce as yet conceived, and before the birth; and it appears still more and
more, as the rapacity of Wolves shows it self in their whelps.

Psalm. 51.7. Behold, I was borne in iniquity, and in sin has my mother
conceived me.

2 Cor. 5.21. For he has made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin.

VIII. Original sin does consist not only in an impotency, and inaptitude to
goodness; but also in pronenesse to evil; neither is it only the amission of
Original good, but also the immission of the contrary evil.

IX By Original sin our natural gifts are corrupted, but supernatural are
utterly lost.

X. The Understanding remained, but darkened; the Will remained, but depraved;
the inferior Appetite remained, but altogether vitiated.

XI Hence it is, that in natural and civil actions, an irregenerate man can do
no good without special grace.

XII. Without this special grace, no excellent thing could be performed by the
Gentiles.

XIII. Whatsoever good then that was which they did, it was mixed with much
vanity; so that their chief virtues were in Gods sight, but glorious enormities.

XIV. For those are not good works which are good in themse^ves, but which are
done well.

A work is said, to be good, either univocally, or equivocally, univocally, so
such a work is simply good in respect of all circumstances: equivocally, a work
is good in it self; but withal, vicious, either in respect of the subject, or
object; or means, or the end: for if we look upon the actions of the Gentiles,
we shall find, that they aimed more at their own, than at Gods glory in them.

XV. Although the affections of the wicked are kept in by God as with a Bit,
yet they are not healed.

XVI. But supernatural gifts were utterly lost A. R. When it is said here, that
supernatural gifts were utterly lost, is meant, that Faith was utterly lost;
and Faith is the chief of all supernatural gifts* now that Faith was utterly
lost in our first Parents, is plain, because they gave credit to the Serpent,
therefore they believed not that God was either true or omnipotent: they
thought to hide themselves from him; therefore they believed not his
omnipresence, and in a manner, Adam accused God for giving him the woman, that
made him sin; and in this, he lost the faith of Gods goodness and justice; yet
though man lost his Faith he did not utterly lose all other spiritual gif^s;
for he did not utterly lose the knowledge of God, nor did his posterity, for
that is learned by the things that are made, Romans 1.20. nor did he utterly lose
the fear of God, for Adam confesses, Gen 3. that when be heard the voice of
God, he was afraid; which Fear, though servile, yet it is a supernatural gift,
but of an inferior rank.
, to wit, the claritie of the intellect, the rectitude of the will, and the
conformity of the appetite with reason.

XVII. When it is said here that there is no spiritual knowledge in us, this
must not be taken subjectively but causatively: for there is knowledge in us
because the soul is the subject of knowledge; but this knowledge or performance
of spiritual things is not of us, or from us; for of our selves we cannot think
a good thought. Again, when it i^ said here, that the principle of this
knowledge is not in us; the meaning is, that the pri^e or chief principle is
not in us, for that is grace; yet the secondary or subordinate principle of
know^edge is in us, and that is the mind. Lastly, it is said here that this
principle is not in us either in act or in possibility* we must not conceive
that here is meant possibility passive; for there is in us a power to receive
spiritual knowledge when it is infused, or else (...) stones: but here is meant
an active possibility; for we are no^ agents but patients, in the f^^st act of
our conversion, so that there is no power not possibility in us to illuminate
our own minds, or to rect^fie our own will.
Hence there is no principle of knowledge, or performance of spiritual things
in us, either in act or in possibility.

XVIII. They seek then the house in the ashes, who ascribe to an unregenerate
man free will, or other faculties, by which he may do well, or prepare himself
to his own conversion, or to the acceptance of Gods grace.

For this is the error of Pelagians, and Semi-pelagians.

XIX. Man's will remained free from coaction, but not to good and evil.

XX. Yea, it is free to evil only, and therefore deserves rather to be called
servile than free.

As for the understanding, the natural man comprehends not the things that are
of Gods Spirit, 1 Cor. 2.14. If you look upon the will, the imagination of man's
heart is only evil, Genesis 8.21. Finally, the Scripture cries out, that the
whole man having lost his spiritual life, lies dead in sin, Ephesians. 2.1. Col.
2.13.

XXI. Although this sin is pardoned in the sanctified Parents, notwithstanding
by generation it is tansmitted to posterity.

The reason is, because the corruption dwelling in us, is not altogether taken
away by pardon, although the guilt be done away; and as faith is the gift, not
of generation* but of regeneration; so man, not as he is regenerate, but as
man, begets man; even as seeds being winnowed from the ears, chaff and husks,
do spring up again with the same.

CHAP. XI. Of actual Sin.
SO much of Original sin; Actual sin is, whereby Gods Law is broken by
thoughts, desires, words, or deeds.

The RULES.
I. According to the diversity of circumstances, there are diverse sins.

II. From the efficient cause; sin is either of public or of private persons,
as they are in more or less dignity.

III. From the matter; which are things thought, desired, said, or done.

IV. From the form; it is either of commission, or omission.

V. From the end; it is either of incogitancy, or of affectation, and against
conscience; and that rather of malice, than of infirmity; or contrarily, rather
of infirmity, than malice.

VI. From the subject; it is of the soul chiefly, or of the body, or of both.

VII. From the object; it is either committed against God, or our neighbor.

VIII. Sin committed against God, is either with a kind of unwillingness, or
with a full desire, this later sin, the Scripture calls, the sin against the
holy Ghost, and to death.

Matthew, 12.32. 1 John 5.16.

IX. The sin against the Holy Ghost, or to death, is, when one is convicted in
his conscience by the testimony of the Holy Spirit, resists notwithstanding
the same, spitefully, wantonly, and with an high hand.

X. Sin against man, is committed, either against superiors, or inferiors, or
equals; being knit by fewer or more bands of blood, affinity etc.

XI. From the adjuncts; a sin is either such of it self* or by accident.

Such are scandals, in things otherwise indifferent, see Romans 14.

XII. No sin of its own nature is venial, or so small, as not to merit
damnation.

By this maxim, the Popish error, that some sins of themselves are venial* is
condemned; the reason is manifest by the object, and the effect: for there is
no sin, which is not conjoined with the offense of Gods Majesty.

XI^I. Yet in resp^ct of the event, to wit, Christ's merits and Gods fav^ur, all
sins are pardonable, ex^ept fin^l infidelity, and the sin against the Holy
Ghost.

Not as though these sins were greater than Grace and Christ's merit; but
because they resist grace and Christ's merit, and despise both.

XIV. We are to judge of the degrees of other sins, by the circumstances; the
considera^ion of which does aggravate or lessen them.

Thus the sin of a superior is greater than of an inferior* for sin is so
much the more conspicuous, by how much the more eminent he is that sins. The
sin of desire is greater than the sin of thought alone; A sin committed in word
and deed is greater than that which is in thought and desire; sin committed
with affectation, is greater than that which ^s done of incogita^cy; the sin of
commission, is greater than of omission, if it be in the same kind; the sin
against God, is greater than against man; that sin is greater which is
committed against him, to whom we are most beholding for favors, than against
another; for example, A sin against our Parents is greater, if it be in the
same kind, than against a brother; a scandal against a we^k brother, ^s
greater than against a stronger.

CHAP. XII. Of the Miseries which follow Sin.
HItherto of sin; now of the mise^y that follows upon sin: This misery is
either temporal or eternal, both which is either corporal or spiritual.

The RULES.
I. God comprehended all man's misery under the name of death.

Gen 2.17. What day thou shall eat of it (to wit of the fruit of the Tree of
knowledge of good and evil) thou shall dye the death.

II. There be four degrees of this death.

III. The first degree, is death spiritual, which is the privation of spiritual
life: Of this man being destitute, he lives only to sin.

Rev. 3.1. I know thyworks, in that thou art said to live, but thou art dead.

IV. The second degree, is the death of affliction, which is the privation of
original happiness, and the inflicting of all sorts of calamities.

Exodus 10.17. Pray to the Lord, that he would remove this death from me.

V. The third degree, is death corporal, which is the privation of this life,
and the resolution of the body into dust, and the reversion of the soul to God.

Eccles* 12.7. He shall return to dust, from whence he came, and the soul to
God that gave it. The soul returns to God either as to a Father, or as to a
just Judge: And although by the bounty of Christ, our death is become a passage
from this life to that which is eternal; yet in this place we consider it as it
is in it self.

VI. The fourth degree, is death eternal, or the state of the damned; which in
relation to death corporal, is called the second death.

Rev. 21.8.

VII. We must imagine nothing of the state of the damned, which is not in
Scripture,

VIII. This state consists in the privation of the chief good, and infliction
of the greatest evil.

IX The privation of the chief good is, whereby they are for ever excluded from
the fellowship of God, and of the blessed.

Mat. 25* 41. Go from me ye cursed.

X. But the chief evil shall be a communion for ever with the Devil and his
Angels.

Matthew. 25.41. Into everlasting fire prepared for the Devil, etc.

XI. The place appointed for the damned is Hell.

XII. But where Hell is, we are not to search or enquire.

XIII. It Is sufficient that in Scripture it is named Gehe^na Mat. 5 22.
, a Fiery Furnace Mat. 13.42.
, the place of torment, Luke 16.28
a Prison 1 Pet, 3.19.
, bottomless pit Rev 9.1.
, the lake of fi^e Rev. 20.15.
, burning with fi^e and brimstone Rev. 21.8.
.

XIV. In the pains of the damned we are to consider the multitude, greatness
and continuance.

XV. Their multipli^ity is known, because their torments will be spiritua^ and
corporal.

XVI. The chiefest of the spiritu^l pains are, the worm of conscience never
dying, Esa 66 ^4.
, and that which follow* ^t* an extreme and inexpressi^l^ sorrow and anguish
Rom 2.9.
.

XVII. The corporal p^ins are under^tood by the phras^ of ^^qu^n^h^^le fire;
for in this life th^re is no torm^nt greater than that of fire.

Matthew. 13.42. Rev. 20.15.

XVIII. The greatness of the pains is understood by weeping and gnashing of
teeth.

For these be symptoms of the greatest pain and torture, Mat. 22.13.

XIX. But this misery is eternal, whereby no deliverance is to be expected by
the reprobate.

Luke 16.26. Between us and you there is a great gulf, that they who would come
to you from hence cannot, nor from thence come hither Rev. 14. ver. 11. The
smoke of their torment shall ascend for ever and ever.

XX. Those fopperies of the Papists, which they have borrowed out of the
heathen Poets, concerning the place of Infants in hell, and of the Fathers, and
of the Purgatory, are savourless, and not worth the refuting.

CHAP. XIII. Of the Moral Law.
HItherto of the state of Innocence and Misery* now follows the state of Grace
and Glory. The Doctrine of the state of grace has two parts: the one is
concerning a redeemer, the efficient cause of this state; the other concerning
our calling to this state.

The Redeemer is known by the Law and by the Gospel: By the Law we know the
necessity, by the Gospel the verity of our Redemption.

The Law is that Doctrine whereby God manifests what he will have performed
by us, under the commination of death eternal, and promise of eternal life,
that by apprehending the inability which is in our selves of satisfying the
Law, we may be driven to seek help in Christ.

The RULES.
I. The Law of God given by Moses, differs not really, but in some respect from
the Law of nature planted in Adam, A. R. Therefore all men are bound to obey
the moral Law; not because it was given by Moses, for so the Jews were only
tied to it, but as it is the Law of nature.
the remainders of which are as yet to be found among the Gentiles.

Romans 2.14.15. The Gentiles which have not the Law, do by nature the things
contained in the Law; these having not a Law, are a Law to themselves, which
show the work of the Law written in their hearts.

II. No man except Christ, has, or can fulfill the Law perfectly.

III. But we are all guilty of the breach and violation of this Law.

Romans 3.23. All have sinned and come short of the glory of God.

IV. We are then doubly miserable, both in that we come short of the promise of
life eternal, and are made guilty of eternal death.

Levit. 18.5. Who does these things shall live by them. Deuteronomy. 27.26. Cursed is
he that confirms not all the words of this Law to do them.

V. Therefore it requires of us a double satisfaction, if we would have it
fulfilled: For it obliges us to punishment, and to obedience: The Commination
of the Law requires that, the Promise requires this.

Therefore these are falsely pronounced disjunctively; to wit, That we are
obliged either to punishment, or to obedience: the Law obliges us to both; for
there is no way to attain life eternal, but in fulfilling the Law, of which
Christ says, do this and thou shall live, Luke 10.28. Therefore albeit we were
free from the guilt and punishment of transgression, yet we cannot attain life
eternal without fulfilling the Law.

VI. Whereas we can neither way satisfy it bids us seek for both in Christ.

VII. And for this end, the Law is renewed after the fall, and as it were
restored from death to life.

For it was given to the first man, that he might attain to eternal happiness
by his own obedience, if he pleased: but it is proposed to man since his fall,
that by perceiving his own inability to perform it, he may perform it in
Christ. Romans 10.4. Christ is the end of the Law unto righteousness to every one
that believes.

VIII. Therefore the promulgation of the Law to the Israelites, on Mount Sinai,
was a singular benefit.

IX. The Law was mended by Christ, not as though it had been imperfect, nor as
though Christ had been another Moses to establish a new one, but he only
vindicated it from the Pharisees corrupt glosses.

The Pharisees did expound the Law accoring to the letter only, and did urge
only outward obedience, as it appears by the refutation of them, Mat. 5.
Therefore the Samosatenians* and their fellows, who accuse the Law of
imperfection, are deceived: for though it be imperfect in respect of us,
because by our fault it is made insufficient to save us; yet in it self it is
perfect, besides it is the perfect Idea of that Justice which is in the Kingdom
of Heaven

X. Therefore falsely do the Pontificians-affirm, that the perfection of the
Law consists rather in councels, than in precepts.

The Law is either Moral, Ceremonial, or Judicial: the Moral is that which God
comprehended in the ten Commandments.

The Rules for right understanding and explaining the Decalogue, are these
following.

The RULES.
I. The interpretation of every precept, is to be sought out of its next end.

II. Whereas the precepts are most brief, they are also Synecdochical: for out
of negatives we must understand affirmatives and contrarily, so things forbid,
out of things commanded, and on the contrary; out of the species the genus, and
contrarily out of the outward worship, we understand the inward, and on the
contrary; out of things done, and spoken, desires, counsels and actions; and
finally, out of relatives we are to understand correlatives.

III. One and the same thing may be reduced to diverse precepts in diverse
respects.

IV. A general Law yields to a particular.

V. There is a greater force or emphasis in negatives than in affirmatives.

For negatives are of a far larger extent; whereas affirmatives include
circumstances: affirmatives oblige always but not incessantly; whereas negatives
oblige both always, and incessantly. For example, we are always bound to do
our neighbor good, but not incessantly, for there is not continually occasions
to do him good: on the contrary, it is never lawful to hurt our neighbor.

VI. Hence there are more negative than affirmative precepts.

VII. Every sin bears the name of that sin, which by name is prohibited.

The reason is that we may take the more notice of the filthiness of sin; so
Christ calls a wanton look upon a woman adultery; and John calls hatred
murder, Matthew. 5.28. 1 John. 3.15.

VIII. Earthly promises are symbols of heavenly things.

Therefore the Servetans and Anabaptists do falsely dream that these promises
are only earthly, the earthly promises include heavenly: for so it pleased God
to apply himself to that ignorant people, and as yet under the Paedagogie of
the Law.

The parts of the Decalogue are two, the Preface and the Precepts.

The preface is twofold; the one of Moses, the other of God,

The Preface of Moses is this, Then God spoke all these words.

Gods preface is this, I am the Lord thy God which brought thee out of Egypt.

In which words he shows his selfe-power and full authority in commanding:
drawing reasons, 1. From his divine essence, the symbols whereof, are the names
Jehovah, Elohim. 2 From the Covenant of Grace, the sign whereof, is that
Phrase, Thy God: 3. From the benefit of Redemption, the type whereof was, the
delivery of the Israelites out of Egypt.

Of the Commandments there are two Tables; the first is, concerning our duty
toward God, the other of our duty toward our Neighbor.

The sum of the first Table is, Thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy
heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy strength.

Which, words require both sincerity and perfection in our love; sincerity,
because there is mentioned the heart, the soul, and all our strength;
perfection, because we are b^d love God with all our heart, all our soul, all
ou^ strength.

To this Table there belong four Commandments* the first shows who is to be
worshipped for the true God; the second, after what manner he must be
worshipped; the third, how we are to honor his name all our life; the fourth,
at what times the public worship of God is to be maintained.

The sum of the second Table is, Thou shall love thy neighbor as thy self:
this command is like the former, because as that is the sum of the four first
preceps: so this is the sum of the six last, concerning our love toward our
neighbor: to this then belongs the fifth command, of preserving the dignity of
our neighbor, the sixth, of his life, the seventh, of preserving our neighbors
chastity, the eigh^h, of his estate, the ni^ht of his fame, the tenth, of
restraining vicious affections toward our neighbor.

Let this concerning the Moral Law, suffice to evince the necessity of
Redemption; for what good works belong to eevery Precept shall be taught in the
second Book*

CHAP. XIV. Of the Ceremonial and Judicial Law.
THe Ceremonial and Judicial Laws, serve as handmaids to the Moral: that to
the first, and this chiefly to the second Table.

The Ceremonial Law is that, in which God commanded certain Ceremonies and
outward Rites, as Types of Christ hereafter to be exhibited.

The RULES.
I. The Ceremonial Law is a Schoolmaster to lead us to Christ, Gal 3.24.

II. The Ceremonial Law gives place to the Moral.

1. Because it is in a manner the handmaid of the Moral Law. 2. Because it was
not to continue for ever. 3. Because charity is to be preferred before
Ceremonies. Hence is that of Hos. 6.6. I will have mercy and not sacrifice.

III The Ceremonial Law was, as it were a handwriting and testimony of that
guilt by which all men were held bound.

Col. 2.14. And putting out the handwriting of Ordinances, that was against us,
which was contrary to us; he even took it out of the way, and fastened it on
the Cross.

IV. The Ceremonial Law was then abolished by Christ 's death.

V. The use of it before Christ 's death was profitable after his death, until
the Gospel was spread abroad, it was indifferent; but after the promulgation of
the Gospel, not only was the observation of Ceremonies unwholsom, but also
mortal.

Hence Paul, in the beginning, caused Timothy to be circumcised because of the
weaknes^ of the Jews, Acts 16 3. but after the Gospel was more fully
manifested, he would not suffer Titus to be circumcised, Gal. 2.3, And ^urely
at this day to observe the Jewish Ceremonies, were to deny Christ his death,
and coming in the flesh.

VI. Therefore as the opinion of the Encratites and other ancient Heretics,
whereby they prohibited certain meats, as of themselves unclean, was damnable;
so the error of Papists is to be abhorred, who obtrude upon the Church,
Ceremonies partly Jewish partly Heathenish.

The precepts of the ceremonial Law, are either of holy persons, or of holy
things: holy persons were in general, all that were initiated by Circumcision,
whereby they were obliged to the observation of the other Ceremonies, and then
were put in mind of Sanctification by Christ.

In particular, holy persons were the Ministers both ordinary and
extraordinary: the ordinary, were the Priests and Levites, the Priests were
they who administered the Law by expounding, sacrificing, making intercession,
and blessing such things as were to be performed to God and men.

The RULES.
I. The High Priest was a type of Christ the High Priest.

II His rich clothing and ornaments, almost equal to regal robes, were types of
Christ's dignity, and chiefly of his most perfect ju^tice, See Zac. 3.5.

III. The chief ornaments were the Ephod, ^r cloak and Breast Plate fastened to
the ^loak: on the Ephod were the names of the twelve Tribes engraven upon
precious stones; on the breast plate were Urim and Thummim; from whence the
Church received Oracles: The Cloak then represented the Church; Vrim and
Thummim, that is, light and perfection, did signify Christ the Word and
Interpreter of the Father, our light and perfection; the Ephod represented
Christ, as he performed the things that concerned us; the Breast Plate showed
him, as he performed the things concerning God.

The Levites were they, who being used in stead of the firstborn, were to
attend the Priests, to keep and to carry the Tabernacle with its utensils.

The extraordinary Ministers were the Prophets and Nazarites.

The Prophets were they, who by divine inspiration teaching and reforming the
Priests and people, were types of Christ, the great Prophet.

The Nazarites were they, who by a special vow abstaining from wine, and
consecrating themselves to God, were types of the holiness of Christ.

In the holy worship, we are to observe the instruments, and the manner of it.

The Instruments were the Tabernacle, and the utensils thereof, to wit, the
Ark, the Altars, the Table, and brazen Laver.

The RULES.
I. The Tabernacle was the Type of the Deity, which was to dwell in Christ
bodily.

John. 1.14 He dwell amongst us, as in a Tabernacle. Col. 2.9. In him dwelt the
whole fullness of the Deity bodily.

II. The artificial structure of the Tabernacle, was a type of the spiritual
Fabric of the Church, which was to be grounded upon Christ.

Ephesians. 2.20, 21.

III. The removing of the Tabernacle, did figure the Christian Churches
pilgrimage here on earth.

IV. The uniformity of the Temple, signified the Unity of Christ and the Church.

V. The parts whereof were three, the Court, the Holy-place, and the Holy of
Holies.

VI. The Court in which the people met, was a Type of the visible Church, in
which are good and bad.

VII. The Holy place, was the Court for the Priests, and a type of the true
members of the Church, that elect and royal Priesthood.

1 Pet. 2.9.

VIII. The Holy of Holies, into which none entered, but the High Priest, and
that but once a year, did shadow out the Sanctuary of Heaven, into which
Christ was to enter for our good.

IX. The veil of the Temple garnished with Cherubims, did signify Christ's
flesh, covering as it were the Divine nature.

X. In the Court was the Altar of Burnt offerings overlaid with brass,
representing Christ's flesh united in the Divinity, and withal, his strength of
suffering any thing for us: the Altar also of incense, intimating Christ's
Intercession for us.

XI. There also was the brazen Laver appointed for washing, which signified,
that we are purged by the blood of Christ, that we may offer to God acceptable
sacrifices.

XII. In the Holy-place or Court of the Priests, was the Table, and on it the
Shewbread, and the golden Candlestick, by which was taught, that Christ is to
his people, meat, drink, and light to life eternal.

XIII. In the same place were the Vessels of gold, ready for sprinkling, and
Incense, representing both Christ's death and Intercession.

XIV. In the Holy of Holies, was the golden Censer, proper to the High Priest
alone; and there was also the Ark of the Covenant.

XV The Ark was made of Cedar-wood, and covered with gold, which represented
both Christ's natures.

XVI. The Tables of the Law, the Manna, and Aarons rod kept within the Ark,
represented Christ, as he teaches, nourishes, and rules his People.

XVII. The cover of the Ark, called the Propitiatory, together with the
Cherubims, from whence God promised to speak with Moses; was the type of Christ
covering our sins, defending us by his Angels, and expounding to us the word
and counsel of his Father.

The manner of the Levitical service consists partly in the things that were
offered to God, partly in holy times.

The things that were offered to God, were sacrifices both Expiatory, or of
Propitiation; and Eucharistical, or of thanksgiving.

The Expiatory Sacrifice, or Peace Offering was, when the faithful witnessed
by the killing and offering of living creatures, that they, in themselves were
guilty of death, and that they placed their confidence in the blood of Christ,
as of that immaculate Lamb, who was to be offered afterward for the sins of
the World.

The Sacrifice Expiatory was offered either for all sins, or for some certain
sins.

The sacrifice that was offered for all sins, was called a Holocaust or
Burnt-offering; for it was performed by burning the whole sacrifice.

The sacrifice for certain sins, called the Sacrifice of Redemption, was either
for the sin it self, or for the guilt thereof.

The Sin-offering was, when a sin was expiated, which had been committed out of
error or ignorance, See Levit. 4.2, 3.

The sacrifice for the guilt, called Trepass Offering was, when a sin was
expiated, which had been done wittingly, but yet out of infirmity, Levit. 5,
and 7.

The Eucharistical sacrifice, or Offering of Thanksgiving, was to testify the
gratitude of the offerer. These were performed by offering of gifts only, or
by offering of living creatures also.

The sacrifice of gifts, called Libatio, or Meat Offering was that, in which
meat, drink, oil, salt, frankincense, etc. were offered.

The sacrifice of Living-creatures, was performed either by burning the fat of
the sacrifice, or by killing and eating of the beasts also: That was called,
the Sacrifice of Pacification, This, the sacrifice of Praise.

The holy-times, were either of days, or of years.

Of days were, 1. The morning of each day, and the two evenings, in which the
daily sacrifice was offered. 2. The seventh or Sabbath Day, which was a type of
that sanctification and rest which was to be obtained by Christ. 3. The Calends
or New Mons, or first day of the month.

The times of the year were either anniversary or every year, or else after the
expiration of diverse years.

The anniversary Solemnities were either greater or lesser.

The greater were the feasts of Easter, of Pentecost and of Tabernacles.

The feast of Easter was celebrated the fifteenth day of the first Month, as a
remembrance of the peoples delivery from Egypt, and as a type of future
deliverance by Christ.

The feast of Pentecost was kept the fiftieth day after Easter, as a memorial
of the Law given upon mount Sinai, and as a type of that new Law which was to
be written in our hearts by the holy Ghost, who was to be sent afterward in a
visible form. At this feast were offered the first fruits; hence it was called
the feast of the first fruits.

The feast of Tabernacles, was solemnized the fifteenth day of the seventh
month, as a remembrance of that gracious preservation of the Israelites in the
desert in tents, and as a type of Christ's incarnation: Thanks also were given
to God at this feast for the fruits and harvest; whence it was called the feast
of Collection.

The lesser solemnities were the feast of Trumpets, celebrated the first day of
the seventh month, in which the civil year had its beginning; the feast also
of expiation, which fell out upon the tenth day of the same month: That did
represent the sounding of the Gospel, this of our atonement to be made by Christ

The Solemnities that were kept after diverse years, were the Sabbathical year,
and the year of Jubilee.

The Sabbathical year, or year of weeks, was every seventh year, wherein there
was a cessation from tilling the ground, and from demanding of debts.

The year of Jubilee was every fiftieth year, in which all possessions return to
their owners, and the Hebrew servants were set free: A type of our freedom
from sin and Satan by Christ.

So much for the ceremonial Law, the judicial Law was that which belonged to
the constituting of the Jewish Commonwealth.

The RULES.
I. As the Ceremonial Law had relation to God, so the Judicial to our Neighbor.

II The Judicial Law binds us in those things that agree with the Moral Law,
and were of common right.

III. But what was of private right, and commanded for the Jewish Commonwealth
in particular, do no more bind us, than the Municipal Laws of other
Commonwealths.

CHAP. XV. Of the Gospel, and how it agrees with and differs from the Law.
HItherto we have seen out of the Law, the necessity of Redemption: now we are
to see the truth thereof, in the Gospel.

The Gospel is the joyful news, or Doctrine of the Son of God, being sent into
this World, that he might assume our nature, and might undergo the curse of the
Law for us, that by his perfect obedience to the same, he might obtain life
eternal to us.

The RULES
I. The Law and Gospel agree in the chief efficient cause, to wit God, and in
the instrumental, namely the written Word; but they differ in their outward
instrumental causes: both because the Law was delivered by Moses, and the
Gos^el by Christ fully; and also because the Law is by nature known to man, but
the Gospel is not, except by Gods gracious revelation;

II. They agree in their common matter, because on both sides obedience is
required by promises and threatenings: but they differ in their particular
matter; for the Law principally teaches what we must do, and the Gospel, what
we must believe.

III. They agree in their common form; because on both sides the Looking-glass
of perfect obedience is exhibited: but they differ in their proper form; for
the Law teaches, what is that righteousness which is perfect, and most
pleasing to God; but the Gospel shows where, or in whom we are to find that
perfect righteousness* the Law requires it of us, the Gospel shows where it is
to be found, namely in Christ.

IV. They agree in their principal end, to wit in Gods glory; and in the next
subordinate end to it, namely our salvation, which on either side is seen: but
they differ in their particular ends; for the Law was given to that end, that
it might drive us to seek Christ; but the Gospel that it might exhibit Christ.

V. They agree in their common object, namely in man lapsed; but they differ in
their proper object; for the proper object of the Law, is man, as he is to be
terrified and humbled; but of the Gospel, man as he is terrified and humbled.

VI. They agree in their common adjuncts, to wit, holiness, goodness, and
perfection, which both Law and Gospel have, being considered in themselves, but
they differ in this, that by accident, and by reason of our weakness, the Law
without the Gospel is insufficient to save us.

VII. It is apparent by this comparing of the Law and Gospel, after what manner
these two are proposed in Scripture as subordinate and opposite the one to the
other.

VIII. They are opposite in respect of man as he is regenerate, or
irregenerate, but they are subordinate in the regenerate man.

They are proposed by the Apostle as opposites Romans 6.14. You are not, says
he, under the Law, but under grace. Here he points out the state of man, before
and after regeneration. The unbeliever is said to be under the Law, 1. Because
he is under the curse of the Law. 2. Because he is under the rigor of the Law,
by which it requires perfect righteousness, and obedience. 3. Because he takes
occasion to sin from the Law, according to that, Nitimur in vetitum semper,
cupimusque negata. We always incline to forbidden things and desire that which
is denied us, see Romans 7.8. But the believer is said to be under grace; 1.
Because he is free from the curse of the Law. 2. Because he is delivered from
the rigor of the Law, and that exaction of perfect righteousness to wit, that
which Christ has performed. 3. Because he is delivered from the dominion of
sin, so that he takes not any longer from the Law occasion to sin, but begins
to yield obedience to the Law, by the operation of the Holy Ghost, that he
might give witness of his thankefullness. But they are set out as subordinate
when Christ is said to be the end of the Law Romans 10.4. when it is called a
Schoolmaster to lead us to Christ, Gal. 3.24. and when the Law, is said not to
be contrary to him who does the works of the Spirit, Gal. 5.22, 23. For that
righteousness which the Law requires, that the Gospel exhibites in Christ to
the Believer* and albeit we cannot in this life yield full satisfaction to the
Law, yet the regenerate begin to obey it, by the grace of sanctification.

CHAP. XVI. Of the Person of Christ God and Man.
THe parts of the Gospel concerning Christ our Redeemer, are two; the first is
of his person, the other of his Office.

In respect of the Person; the Redeemer is God and man; that is, Gods eternal
Son, being incarnate or made man, in the fullness of time.

John. 1.14. And the word was made flesh and dwelt amongst us Gal. 4 4. But
after the fullness of time came, God sent his Son made of a Woman. 1. Tim. 3
16. and without controve^sie, great is the mystery of godliness, God made
manifest in the flesh.

The RULES.
I. The Incarnation of Christ originally, is the work of the whole blessed
Trinity; but terminatively, or in respect of the object, it is the work of the
Son alone.

For the son only assumed man's nature; which the father in the Son, by the
Holy Ghost formed of the substance of the blessed Virgin.

II The person of Christ is considered, either disjunctively, as the Word, and
the eternal Son of God: or conjunctively, as God and man: the first
consideration is according to Divinity; the latter according to Oeconomie or
Gods gracious dispensation.

III. Likewise the divine nature is considered, either in it self, and simply;
or relatively, as it is in the Person of the Word by dispensation.

IV. Alth^ugh then it be true, that Christ-God is become man, yet it follows
not, that therefore the Divinity is incarnate; or, because the Son is
Incarnate, that the Father also and Holy Ghost are Incarnate.

V. The matter out of which the Incarnation was effected, is the seed of the
Woman, or of the blessed Virgin, Genesis 3.15.

VI. The form of it consists in the Personal Union, whereby the word was
made flesh; and Christ remained the same he was, and became what he was not.

VII. The end is Gods glory and our salvation.

VIII, Both the truth of God, as also our salvation, do evince the necessity of
Christ's incarnation:

IX: The truth of God: because in the Old Testament, it was uttered by diverse
Prophesies; and was shaddowed by diverse types: These are the chief Prophesies.
Gen 3.15 I will put enmity between thee and the Woman, and between thy seed and
her seed, it shall bruise thy head, and thou shall bruise his heel, Genesis 22.18,
In thy seed all nations shall be blessed. Esa. 7.14. Behold a Virgin shall
conceive and bring forth a Son, and they shall call his name Emanuel. Esa. 9.6,
7. For unto us a child is borne, and unto us a Son is given, Jer. 23.5. Behold,
the days shall come, in which I will raise to David a righteous branch, and a
King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice on the
earth. In his days ^udah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely; and
this is his name whereby he shall be called, The Lord our righteousness. But
his types were the Tabernacle, the Arc of the Covenant, and such like, of
which we have said: but chiefly Melchisedeck without father, without mother,
Hebr. 7.3. and; that humane shape or form in which he appeared of old
frequently to the Fathers.

X. Our salvation for this cause does evince and prove the necessity of his
Incarnation, in that we could not be saved, but by such a redeemer, who was
both God and Man in one Person, or God-man.

XI. That he should be God, was requisite in respect of both parties: on the
one side the Majesty of God required it; on the other side our wants, the
greatness of the evil that was to be removed, and the good that was to be
restored.

Such is the Majesty of God, that no man could interpose himself, but he who
was one with the Father, the very Angels durst not do this, because they also
stood in need of Christ the Mediator, Col. 1.16 17. Because they being compared
with God, are unclean, Ioh. 15.15 and for this cause, they cover their faces in
Gods presence, Isa. 6.2. How much less then could any man intercede, whereas
there is not one just person? Romans 3.10. The evil that was to be taken away
was sin; and the consequents of sin; the wrath of God, the power of Satan; both
temporal and eternal death. Now I pray, by whose suffering could that infinite
Majesty be satisfied; which was offended, unless by his suffering who was also
Infinit^? By whose Intercession could the wrath of God be appeased, but by his
only, who is that best beloved son of God? By whose strength could Satan, with
the whole power of darkness be overcome, except by his, who in power exceeds
all the Devils? who finally could overcome death, except he who had the power
over death? Heb. 2.15. But the good things that were to be ^estred, were
perfect righteousness, adoption into sons, the Image of God, the gifts of the
holy Ghost, life eternal, and such like: but now, who could bestow that
righteousness on us, except he who is justice it self? Who is so fit to make us
the sons of God, as he who is by nature the Son of God? Who was so fit to
restore in us the image of God, as he who is himself the Image of the
invisible God? who can bestow on us the holy Spirit so assuredly as he from
whom the spirit proceeds? Who at last can give us life eternal, but he who is
life it self, John 1.4.

XII. That he might be man the justice of God required; which as it leaves not
sin unpunished, so it punishes not sin but in that nature which sinned.

The first branch of this Rule is plain, both by the justice and by the truth
of God: By his justice, because God by this does not only resist, but also
punish sin, Psalm. 5.4, 5, 6. For thou art not a God that have pleasure in
wickedness, nor shall evil dwell with thee: the foolish shall not stand in thy
sight; thou hate all workers of iniquity, thou shall destroy them that speak
lies: the Lord will abhor the blody and deceitful man. Now by the truth of God;
because the threatening, which was given before the fall, could not be in vain:
therefore Socinus is idle and foolish, who (that he might overthrow the merit
of Christ) feigns such a justice of God, which does not necessarily inflict
eternal death, or require satisfaction; and which in this respect can be
content to loose its own right: but if sins were to be punished they were
surely to be punished in our nature; for to man the Law was given, and to man
death was threatened; therefore it lies upon man to suffer the punishment.

XIII It was requisite that God and man should be united in one person, that he
might be a Mediator between God and us.

He was therefore the medium between God and man, that is, he was at the same
time God and man, that he might perform those things which were to be effected
toward God and man, Heb. 5.1. These works of God and man do require both
natures in the same person, of which in the next Chapter more at large.

The parts of Christ's Incarnation are two, to wit, the Conception, and the
Nativity.

In the Conception three things, for the better understanding, are
considerable; the forming, the assuming, and the personal union of the humane
nature.

The forming of the humane nature of Christ, is that whereby it was produced
without the help of man, of the Virgins blood, by the operation of the Holy
Ghost.

The RULES.
I. The holy Ghost is not the material, but the efficient cause of Christ's
conception; For he was conceived not of his substance, but by his power; not by
generation, but by his commanding force and benediction. Aug.

II. The next or proximate matter was the blood of the blessed Virgin.

III. The form of Christ's conception, consists in the preparing and
sanctifying of the Virgins blood by the Virtue of the holy Ghost, in the
forming of the body, whereby together at the same instant it was made perfect,
and not successively, as the bodies of other men are: lastly, in the inspiring
of the reasonable soul.

Whereas forty days are appointed in ordinary generation for the time of
forming the Embryo; the body of Christ was perfected in a moment; otherwise not
Christ the man, but an Embryo had been conceived.

IV. The end of Christ's miraculous conception was, that he might be free from
Original sin, for this sticks close to all that are of and by Adam, that is, to
all who are naturally descended from him: but it was needful that Christ
should be born without sin, that we might have a Holy High Priest; Heb. 7.26.

The assumption of the humane nature is, whereby Christ assumed truly a humane
soul and body, with all their affections, properties, and infirmities, yet
without sin.

The RULES.
I. Christ assumed not man, but the humanity; not the person, but the nature.

For otherwise he had not been God-man and one person, but two persons, and so
there had been two Christ's. The Scripture styles him Emanuel, because the same
who is with us, that is to say who is man, is also God, Isa. 7.14. the same
eternal Word is said to be made flesh, John. 1.1. and the same is called both
David's Son and his Lord, Matthew. 22 42. etc.

II. And not only did he assume a true humane body, consisting of three
dimensions and a true soul; but also the essential Properties.

III. Yea, and he took our infirmities too, but not those damnable ones; but
such as were faultlesse and miserable.

Th^se infirmities are either of the body, or of the soul. Again, the
infirmities of the body are from external causes, as the calamities and
torments inflicted by enemies: Or they have their being from some internal
cause, and they follow wholly our nature; since it fell from its primitive
happiness; as to be cold, to be hot, to thirst, to hunger, to be in pain, to
grow weary, and such like: But the infirmities of the soul, are sadness, fear,
ignorance, etc.

IV. So likewise he took upon us our affections, but free from all disorder, or
inclination to evil.

The personal Union is, whereby the Person of the Son of God did communicate
his Hypostasis or Personality to the humane nature and he so knit it to
himself, and with his divine nature, that the properties of both natures being
entire, he is in one Person God and Man.

The RULES.
I. Christ's humane nature has no other, or particular Hypostasies or
subsistence, than that of the Word, that is of the Son of God.

In this point, Christ differs from all other men; because every man has a
peculiar Hypostasis or manner of subsistence, by which he differs from other
Persons besides his essence* consisting of body and soul: but Christ's humane
nature wanting a proper subsist^nce, is assumed into the fellowship of the
Hypostasis of the divine nature: neither do we infer from hence, that the
humane nature in Christ, in this point, is more inferior than in other men; for
it is so much the more excellent in Christ, by how much the subsistence of the
Son of God does exceed other creatures.

II. For the better conceiving of this mystery, it is expedient that we show
how the humane nature was, and was not united to the Son of God.

III. It was not united coessentially, as the Persons in the Godhead are
united, not essentially only and virtually; as the essence of Christ is present
to all; not by way of assistance, or by the presence of grace only; not
naturally, as the matter and form are united, not by way of convenience, as
one friend to another; not mystically only, as Christ dwells in the faithful;
not Sacramentally, as he is in the holy Supper, but Hypostatically and
personally; that is to say (that we may more fully explain our selves for the
avoiding the Eutychian and Nestorian Heresy) 1 Immutably, without changing of
the divine Person. 2. Indivulsably, without pul^ing the natures asunder, with
Nestorius. 3. Inconfusedly, without confounding the natures, with Eutyches, 4
Inseparably.

IV. There are three effects of the Personal Union, the communication of
properties; the excellency of the human nature, and the cooperation of both
natures in these common works of God and man.

V The communication of properties is a manner of speaking, whereby that which
belongs to either nature is predicated of the Person of Christ, which way
soever it is called: This is either directly done, or indirectly. directly,
when that which belongs to the divine nature is predicated of the Person so
nominated from the divine nature; even so are things denominated from the
humane nature which belong to the humane nature* Joh. 1.1. In the beginning was
the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God. etc. Luc. 18.32. The
Son of man shall be delivered to the Gentiles, he shall be mocked, and
spitefully entreated, and spit upon. Indirectly, when that which belongs to the
Divinity is enunciated or said of Christ as man; and what appertains to the
humanity is spoken of Christ as God: as Joh. 3.13. No man has ascended to
Heaven, but he that descended, to wit, the ^on of man, which is in Heaven, Act.
20.28. God has purchased the Church with his own precious blood.

VI. This communication is verbal or real; verbal in respect of the manner of
speaking, but real in respect of the foundation; to wit, of the personal union.

For as both natures truly subsist in the Person of the Son of God, so the
propert^es of both natures are common to him.

VII. But here we must distinguish the concrete words from the abstract; for
those belong to the Person, but these to either Nature.

Therefore I may truly say, God is man, and man is God; but not likewise the
Deity is the Humanity, or the Humanity the Deity: for even in natural things
there is this difference, many things are opposite in the abstract, which in
the concrete are but diverse or subordinate: for we say rightly, that is
corporeal which is animate: and something corporeal is animate; but we cannot
say, that the soul is the body, or that the body is the soul so all Christ is
every where, but not all of Christ or both Natures.

VIII The excellency of Christ 's humane nature, consists partly in those
gifts which proceed from the grace of union, and partly in the honor of
adoration.

IX Among his gifts, we are chiefly to consider his Knowledge and Power.

X* Although that eternal knowledge which is an essential property of the
Divine nature, is not transfused into the Humane nature; yet in this humane
nature there is a threefold knowledge, to wit, a donative, an infused, and an
experimental.

XI. The donative, called also the Knowledge of the blessed, is that whereby
the humane nature being most nearly united to the Divine essence, sees the
same, though it cannot comprehend it.

For a finite thing cannot comprehend an infinite; it sees God all, but not*
altogether or totally

XII. The infused knowledge is that, whereby Christ being anointed by the holy
Ghost, knows all heavenly things, which otherwise cannot be seen but by the
light of grace.

XIII. The experimental knowledge is that, by which Christ knows the things
that are intelligible by the light of nature; conceiving the effects out of
their causes, and the causes out of their effects.

XIV. Albeit both in his donative and infused knowledge he excels Angels and
Men, yet this differs from his eternal omniscience.

XV. Ignorance is opposite to his experimental knowledge: which A. R. It is
said here, that Ignorance is attributed to Christ; This cannot be meant
properly; for it was not fit there should be ignorance in him, who came to cure
our ignorance: And if ignorance be the want of that knowledge which ought to be
in us, it must needs be sin in whomsoever it is. There is a difference between
these two phrases: not to know and to be ignorant: for ignorance is the
privation of knowledge, which is a habit; and that was not in him, in whom were
hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. And so Peter, Joh. 21. and all
the Disciples, Ioh. 16. confess that Christ knew all things. But not to know,
signifies the suspension of the act of knowledge only, which can be no
privation in him that has the habit. To wink, is not to be blind: for he that
winks has the habit of sight, which a blind man wants. Again, to know in
Scripture is sometime to make known; as Genesis 22. Now I know that thou fear
me; that is, I have made it known. So, not to know, is not to make known, by
the rule of contraries. So, Christ knew not the last day; that is, he made it
not known, or he did not know that day to reveal it. So when Christ is said to
increase in knowledge, is not meant that he was ignorant, but that he attained
to the knowledge which he had before, after another manner than he did before,
that is experimentaly now, habitually before*
ignorance is attributed to Christ; for in this kind of knowledge he is said to
increase, Luke 2.25.

XVI. Such is the power of his humane nature, that in this also it is superior
to men and Angels, for it received an instrumental power to work miracles; but
the principal or omnipotent power was reserved for the Word, which makes use
of the humane nature as of an instrument.

XVII. The adoration of the humane nature is an honor that follows upon the
Personal union; yet this adoration is not of the flesh, as flesh, nor of the
creature, but of God in the created flesh.

XVIII. The third thing that follows upon the Hypostatical union; is the
meeting of both natures in those works which are called (...), that is, God
man; and (...), or Perfections: in which these four things are considerable:
1. The worker, Christ himself: 2. The principles by which he works, to wit, the
two Natures: 3. The force or enargie, or the twofold action according to the
twofold nature: 4. The external work it self, in which those actions are united.

This is made clear by the ^^m^ly of a Fiery sword; in which, 1. We see the
unity of the Sword. 2. The two principles of working, to wit the Sword and the
fire 3 Two actions, cutting and burning. 4. One work; the thing cut and burned.

So much of Christ's Conception. His Nativity is, whereby Christ according to
the usual time being carried in the Virgins womb, was at length born and
brought forth to light.

Luc. 2 6, 7. So it was, that while they were there, the days were
accomplished that she should be delivered, and she brought forth her
firstborn Son.

The RULES.
I. We firmly believe Christ's nativity, against the Jews.

The confirmation is twofold. The first out of the Prophets: because the places
in which he should be born and educated, in which he should teach and suffer
are wasted; and the time is past, in which according to Prophetical oracles he
was to come. For he was to be borne in Bethlehem, Mich. 5.2 to be educated in
Naza^eth, Esa. 11.1. and to enter Jerusalem while the second Temple stood,
Zach. 9.9. Hag. 2.7, 9. and that when the fourth Monarchy was abolished; Dan.
2.44. the Scepter not being totally departed from the Jews, Genesis 49.10. But
Bethlehem, Nazareth, Jerusalem and the second Temple are long since destroyed,
that fourth Monarchy is abolished, and the Scepter totally departed from Judah:
the Messiah then is doubtless come. The second confirmation, is taken from the
agreement of Luk's Evangelical History conce^ning Christ his nativity, with the
prophetical oracles concerning the time of the Messiah's coming, Genesis 49.10. of
his Pedigree Ier. 23.5. of the Virgin his mother, Esa. 7.14. of his Country,
Mich. 5.2. Lastly concerning his condition, Esa 53.2.

II The Nativity (to speak properly) is not of the humanity, but of the man
Christ; not of the nature but of the A. R. The Nativity is of the nature as of
the Terminus, but of the Person as of the Subject; for the Person is begot, and
so is the Nature; this terminative, that subjective.
person.

III. There be two generations of the Son: the one eternal, to wit of the
Father; the other temporal, namely of the Virgin his mother. There be also two
filiations or Sonships; by the one whereof he is the Son of the Father, by the
other the Son of Mary.

IV. Yet we must not say there is a double Son or two Sons; for he is not two
Persons, but one Person and two Natures.

V. Therefore Mary is to be named not only the Mother of Christ, with the
Nestorians; but also the mother of God.

VI. The Nativity of Christ is both natural and supernatural: Natural as he was
born in the usual time by the opening of the womb; Supernatural, as he was
begot of a Virgin.

The Papists, under pretense of maintaining Mari's Vi^ginity, affirm that
Christ was born of Ma^y without pain, the womb being shut: Now although we
leave it as a thing doubtful, whether Mari's Childbearing was without pain or
not, as the Ancients thought: yet we deny that Christ came out the womb being
shut; when in plain terms the Law is applied to her, which requires, That
every male, which opens the womb, shall be holy to the Lord, Luc. 2.23. Neither
does Mari's Virginity consist in this, that her womb was not opened in her
Childbirth, but in this that she was known of man.

VII. We believe also that Mary continued a Virgin after her childbirth: For
her marriage with Joseph did not consist in the generation of children, but in
her education, and holy conjunction of life with him.

VIII. Although Christ had no other brothers born after him, yet he is rightly
called Mari's first begotten Son.

In Scripture Christ is called the first born, four manner of ways. 1. In
respect of eternal generation, by which he was begot before all creatures Col.
1.15. 2 In respect of election and dignity, whereby he is the firstborn
amongst brethren, Romans 8.29. 3. In respect of his resurrection, whereby he is
the first-begotten from the dead, Col. 1.18. 4. In respect of his nativity of
the Virgin, Luc. 2.7. Now he is not only called firstborn, whom other
brothers do follow; but he also who is born before others, although he be
indeed the only begotten, or he whom other brothers do not follow; whence such
a one, even before he had any brothers, was consecrated to God, as if he had
been the firstborn, Numb. 18.16.

IX. The fruit of Christ 's nativity is showed, both in the speech and song of
the Angels.

Their speech is, Luc. 2.10, 11. Then the Angel said unto the Shepherds, Fear
not; for behold I bring you tidings of great joy that shall be to all people,
that this day there is born to you a Savior in the City of David, which is
Christ the Lord. Now the song is, Glory to God on high, Peace on earth, and
good will toward men. ib.v. 14

CHAP. XVII Of the Office of Christ the Mediator.
HItherto we have spoken of the Person of Christ our Redeemer; the Office of
his Mediatorship is that, whereby as God-man he was to perform those things,
which for our salvation were to be performed between God and us.

The RULES.
I Christ in respect of his mediatorship (...) fitly called Jesus, Messiah,
Christ, and Lord.

II. Christ is the Mediator of Angels and Men, but not after the same manner;
for he is Mediator to those in respect of their gracious union with God, but
of these in respect of reconciliation and redemption.

III. The efficient cause of this office is the whole blessed Trinity; but the
Father, by way of excellency.

Isa. 42.1. Behold my servant whom I upho^d, mine elect in whom my soul
delights. and Isa. 49.1. The Lord has called me from the womb Psalm 110.4.
The Lord has sworn, and will not repent, thou art a Priest for ever after the
order of Melchisedek, Hebrews 5.5. Christ glorified not himself to be made an
High Priest: but he (...) said to him, thou art my Son, to day I have begot
thee.

I The subject of this office is not only all Christ, but the whole of Christ,
for he is Mediator according to both natures

This is denied by the Samosatenians and Pontificians, who do teach that Christ
was Mediator only according to his humanity. But this rule is grounded upon a
most firm reason: for if the works of a Mediator be the perfect operations of
God and man, in which is required not only the action of man, but of God also,
then doubtless this Office is attributed to Christ even according to his
Divinity: But the former is true, and therefore the latter. The assumption may
be proved by examples: without the operation of the Deity, neither can he
declare the hid wisdom of God, nor illuminate our minds: without the power of
the Deity, neither could his satisfaction obtain the honor of merit with God,
nor could his Intercession be effectual: without the Deity, neither could he
have sustained that heavy bu^ then of Gods wrath, nor had he bin able to subdue
or abolish death and Satan: without the virtue of the Deity, neither could he
have saved his Church, nor have subdued his enemies. Neither is it any
hindrance to this truth, that there is one Mediator of God and man, the man
Christ Jesus, 1 Timothy 2.5. for there the word man, is not the word of the
nature, but of the person: and when he is said to be the Mediator of God and
man, it is presupposed that the Mediation is hypostatical, as Christ is God and
man. In the interim there are many testimonies that prove the operation of the
Deity, Act. 20.28. God did red^eme the Church by his own blood Heb. 9.14. By
the eternal Spirit he offered himself. ^oh. 1.7. The blood of Jesus Christ his
Son cleanses us from all sin. And although the Son be the Party that is
offended, yet it does not hinder but that he may be Mediator to himself. For as
properly Righteousness is called in respect of another, but analogically in
respect of us: so Mediation is properly in reference to others, but
analogically in relation to the Mediator himself. Christ indeed being
absolutely considered is the offended party; yet the same is Mediator, in that
he has undertaken this Office in himself of an Intercessor by agracious
dispensation: No otherways than if the son of a King, who being as much
offended by Rebellion as his Father, should notwithstanding plead for the
Rebels, and reconcile them to his Father.

V. The object of Christ's Office is God offended, and Man the offender.

VI. The manner whereby he is called to this Office, consists in that
plentiful unction of Christ, by which he received the gifts of the Spirit
without measure in respect of us.

Psalm 45.7. God even thy God has anointed thee with the oil of gladness,
above thy fellows. Isa. 61.1. The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he
has anointed me. Ioh. 3* 34. God gave him not the Spirit by measure.

VII. The end of this Office is, that by whom God created all things, by him he
might to himself reconcile all things, Col. 1.20.

VIII. Christ is Mediator both in merit and efficacy; in merit, because he has
most fully satisfied for us; in efficacy, because ^e does effectually apply
this merit to us.

Hence again it is apparent: That this Office is administered by him, not only
according to his humanity, but according to his divinity also; to wit, without
which neither could his merit be of infinite value, nor could it be applied to
us. He does then save and quicken us, he pardons our sins, and hears our
prayers; in his humane nature by his merit; in his divine, by his efficacy.

IX: Christ is the sole and one Mediator: Act. 4.12. For in no other is there
salvation, nor is their any other name under heaven given among men, whereby we
must be saved, 1 Timothy 2.5. There is one Mediator of God and man, the man Christ
Jesus.

This Office of Christ is threefold, Prophetical, Sacerdotal, and Regal: His
Prophetical office was to instruct his Elect in heavenly Truths, the parts
whereof are, the external Preaching of Gods will, and the internal illumination
of the mind.

His Sacerdotal office is, to appear for us before God, with full satisfaction,
and to intercede for us: the parts whereof are, Satisfaction and Intercession.

His Regal office is, to rule and preserve the Church: the parts whereof are,
the Government of the Church, and the destruction of his enemies.

CHAP. XVIII. Of the Humiliation of Christ.
SO much of the Person and Office of the Mediator Christ: the state thereof is
the condition in which Christ as God-man did execute his office of
Mediatorship; and this is either of his Humiliation, or of his exaltation. The
state of Humiliation is, in which he took the form of a Servant being in the
form of God, and gave obedience to his Father for us he died, and was buried,
and went down to Hell: And in this state he so performed his Prophetical,
Sacerdotal, and Regal office, that in a manner he stripped himself of the form
and glory of the Divinity.

He did not cast off the Divinity, but hid it in the assumed form of a servant:
And although the Dei^y of Christ did manifest it self in the state of his
Humiliation, chiefly by miracles; yet this was little in comparison of that
glorious manifestation of him in his exaltation.

In the state of Humiliation he performed his Prophetical office, not only
mediately, by sending John Baptist his Herald before, and by the Apostles whom
he called; but also immediately to his lost sheep, especially of Israel, by
preaching to them the heavenly Truth, with great constancy, patience, and
efficacy, both of his doctrine and miracles.

But his Sacerdotall office he administered in this state, making a most full
satisfaction, and an humble intercession for us.

The satisfaction of Christ is that, whereby he being subject to the Law for
us, did undergo the curse due to our sins, and performed most perfectly
obedience to the Law, which was required of us, and so has freed us from the
curse, and has restored us to life.

This consists in suffering the pains and in perfect justice, in that is seen
chiefly his passive, in this his active obedience.

I do purposely add this restriction, that we may not think his active and
passive obedience so to differ, as if the suffering of ^he punishment consisted
only in his passive obedience, and his perfect justice only in his active; for
they differ not in time, seeing both of them continued from the first moment of
his incarnation till his death. Nor do they differ in subject, because the same
obedience in a different respect is both active and passive; and consequently
Chri^^^ obedience is an active passion, and a passive action: for as passion is
a receiving of the punishment, it is called passive obedience; but as it is a
testimony of his great love, it may be called active. Neither is the division
of obedience into active and passive, a division into parts, but only a
distinction taken from the end; to wit, the twofold satisfaction, for
punishment, and for life eternal. The curse upon the transgresso^s of the Law
requires the former. Deuteronomy. 27.26. The promise of life under the condition of
perfect obedience and righteousness requires the latter, Lev. 18.5. Therefore
we are said Analogicaly by that one and most perfect satisfaction of Christ,
both to be freed from the punishment, because he suffered the punishment for
us, and to be invested in the right of life eternal, because he fulfilled the
Law for us*

The suffering of punishment is, whereby he undertook upon himself the
punishment due to us, and offered himself of his own accord a holy Sacrifice to
God for us.

This consists both in the sufferings which went before his great and last
Passion, but especially in this last agony.

The RULES.
I. No part of Christ's Passion must be excluded from A. R. Christ's passions
were truly satisfactory, if, 1. We consider the greatness of his love. 2. The
greatness and multitude of his sufferings. 3. The dignity of his Person. 4. The
holiness of his life.
his Satisfaction.

The reason, because he did not suffer for himself in any thing, but all for
us.

II. Therefore those innumerable sufferings which Christ endured until his last
journey to Jerusalem, are not to be separated from the price of Christ's
redemption; for although the Passion of Christ which went before his last
agony, might be called a preparative to his death, yet it is indeed an integral
part of satisfaction.

As it cannot be denied, that the payment of an hundred pounds by him who owe^h
diverse tuns of gold, is an integral part of the paymen^, although i^ ^e but a
small sum in respect of the whole and principal debt.

III. Yet the Scripture synecdochically, and by way of excellency, does
describe his last passion as the price of our redemption; and his death or
oblation on the altar of the cross as an expiatory sacrifice.

Of this see the 9. and 10. chapter to the Heb*

IV. The principal efficient cause of this passion, was the holy Trinity; the
ministering causes were Christ's enemies, both Jews and Gentiles.

V. the Person that suffered for us, is not the Father, nor the Holy Ghost, but
the Son of God.

VI. Although God is rightly said to suffer, yet the Godhead suffered not: God
suffered in the flesh, not with the flesh.

VII. The sufferings of Christ were diverse, of which there were three ranks to
wit, some before his death, death it self, and some after death.

VIII Of those that went before his death, some were internal, some external.

IX. The internal were his sadness, anxieties and tortures, proceeding from
the fierceness of Gods wrath, and the conflict he had with that tentation of
dereliction, which cast him into that bloody sweat, and made him cry out, My
God, My God, why have thou forsaken me!

X. But although he wrestled with the tentation of dereliction, yet he fell not
into desperation; neither did he yield to the tentation, but overcame it by a
strong confidence in his God.

The undoubted argument of his victory was this, that in his greatest agony, he
failed not to call God his God.

XI. His external sufferings were the tortures of his body, which he endured in
a manner in all his members and senses: for his head was torn with throns, and
beat with reeds, his face was defiled with spittle, and bruised with buffeting;
his ears were wounded with scoffs and railings; his eyes were troubled with the
mourning of his Mother and his disciples; his tongue was scorched with thirst,
and poisoned with vinegar and gall; his body was stripped, and torn with
whipping, and the same was fastened to the Cross, his hands and feet being
pierced with nails, and was hanged between Thieves; his sinews were racked,
and his side was pierced with a lance.

XII. The Cross was chosen to die on, which was no ordinary kind of death, but
an accursed one; for of old it was made execrable by the mouth of God.

Cursed is he that hangs on a Tree, Deuteronomy. 21.23.

XIII. A R. In Christ's death, the Personal Union was not dissolved: This is
true; and the reason is, because the gifts of God are without repentance: now
the Hypostatical Union is the greate^t of his gifts, which could not be l^st
without sin; and sin could not be in him, who came to save sinners: its true,
Christ seems to grant a dereliction, when he says, My God, my God, why have
thou forsaken me? But these words do not show any d^reliction, or dissolution
of the personal union in death, for Christ spoke them whilst he was alive: they
only show that Christ was left to tread the wine press alone; and yet he was
not alone, for the Father is with me, says he. Christ was alone and forsaken
in respect of Deliverance, but not alone nor forsaken in respect of the divine
presence and assistance, without which he could not have performed that great
work of our redemption. In that the Father left him in the hands of his
enemies, and did not deliver him, he might be said to forsake him; But it may
be objected, that Christ's soul was the medium of the union between the Divinity
and Christ body: This medium being gone, how could the extremes cohere? I
answer, in this union the soul was the medium of congruity, not of necessity,
for the Divinity was united to Christ's body in the Virgins womb, before the
soul was infused, or else he could not have been conceived by the Holy Ghost.
So might the Divinity be united still to the body, after the soul was
separated. The soul indeed being a spirit, was a fit medium to unite the Deity
to the body, but not absolutely necessary.
In Christ's death, the Personal Union was not dissolved; the soul indeed was
severed from the body, but neither of them from the Personality, or Hypostasis
of of the son of God.

XIV. The sufferings that followed his death, were not joined with any pain,
yet they wanted not disgrace or ignominy; such was his burial, and the three
days lying in the grave.

XV. His burial was a part of his sufferings whereby Christ's body, no other
ways than the carcasses of other men, was cast into the grave.

XVI. His three days detention or stay in the grave, is the last degree of his
Humiliation, at which time his soul being translated to Paradise, his body was
detained under the pains and bands of death, as if he had been altogether
overcome and swallowed up by it, his enemies in the mean while triumphing over
him, as if he had been quite cut off.

Acts 2.24. Whom God raised, having loosed the sorrows of death

XVII. When mention is made of Christ's descent into hell, in the fourth Article
of the Creed, it is demanded, of what part of Christ's passion that must be
understood?

That opinion of the Papists concerning Christ's local descent into Limbus
Patrum, or the place of the Fathers and their delivery from thence, is fabulous
and very ridiculous: from which their opinion is not much different, who feign
that Christ entered Hell, that he might triumph there as a Conqueror. Both
opinions are repugnant to the story of the Gospel: For whereas Christ
otherwise in respect of his Deity is every where, his soul being recommended
into the hands of his Father by himself whilst he hung on the Cross, and his
body being laid up in the grave, it must needs be false that Christ did locally
go down to Hell. Besides, whereas God does profess that he is their God after
death, Exodus 3.6 there can be nothing more absurd, than that the souls of the
Fathers should be detained in that limbus or prison. Peter witnesses. 1 Ep.
3.19. that Christ preached to the Spirits of old that were disobedient: but
this is to be understood of that preaching which was before the flood by Noah,
being furnished or instructed for this purpose by the Spirit of Christ. Neither
is there any ground for that fiction of Christ's triumph in Hell; both because
he triumphed not before his resurrection, as also because Heaven was the fit
place of his triumph, not hell. Again, whereas, the word Scheol sometimes
signifies the grave, and sometime Hell the place of the damned, hence it is
that the phrase of Christ's de^cent into hell has diverse meanings in Scripture;
for either it is the same thing that is to be buried, Ps. 16.10 Thou will not
leave my soul in hell. Or it is the same, that is to fall into extreme
tortures, and anguish; 1 Samuel 2.6. The Lord brings down to hell, and brings
out. Psalm. 18.4 The sorrows of hell compassed me about: O^ else it signifies
the state of them who are oppressed and swallowed by death* Ps. 49.14. Like
sheep they lie in hell, death gnaweth upon them. Isa. 14.11, etc. The first
exposition has no place in the fourth Article of the Creed; for it is unlikely
that in so brief an Epitome of Faith there should be any tautology or that a
plain speech should be declared by a darker. In the second, the inconvenience
of a disordered narration seems to resist, to wit, that Christ's extreme
sadness and anguish of mind are rehearsed to be after his death. But Calvin
makes the matter plain, showing that the order of things, and not of time is
observed: so that there are two members of that Article; the former is of the
tortures of the body, the latter of the internal torm^n^s of the mind. They
who maintain the third exposition, do chiefly urge the order of passages; both
because the detention of Christ in the grave is the last degree of humiliation,
as also because by this means the degrees of his joyful exaltation to answer
the sufferings of Christ; to wit, his Resurrection answers his Death; the
Sepulture, his Ascension to heaven; and his descending to hell, the sitting at
his Fathers right hand. Now as this opinion is not disliked, so the former is
not rashly to be rejected; nor should we dispute contentiously in this matter,
seeing this claus of Christ's descent to hell was not always added to the fourth
Article, as the Nicen^ Creed, and diverse others do witness So that this may
remain firm, that neither his spiritual agonies in his soul, nor his three
days detention in the grave, ought to be separated from his sufferings.

XVIII^ For the form or manner of his passion: He suffered, 1. Truly; 2. Holily
and innocently; 3. Voluntarily

These three things are to be well observed: For if he had not truly suffered,
he had not satisfied; if he had not suffered holily and innocently we could not
have a perfect High Priest, Heb 7.26. If lastly, he had not voluntarily
submitted himself, his sacrifice had been compulsory, not free: hence he says,
Heb. 10.7. Behold here I am to do thy will, o God.

XIX. The general end of Christ's passion is the glory of God, and chiefly the
manifestation of his wrath against sin, as also of his justice and mercy;
besides the declaration of the Divine and Humane nature: But the proper and
special end is, Satisfaction for our sins.

XX. In the end and use of every particular Passion, a regard is to be had of
that Analogy in which the Expiation is compared with the sin, and the passion
with the punishment, which we should have suffered.

For example: He sustained most g^ievous tortures in his soul, and body; both
that the sins of soul and body might be exp^ated, as also that we might be
delive^ed from those spiritual and corporal pain, which eternally we should
have suffered. His death upon the cross was exec^able; partly, that he might
expiate the sins by which we deserved to be accursed, partly that he might free
us from that curse and damnat^on. He was buried, to ^estifi^ that our sins were
buried with him, and that he might sanctify our graves in which as is in
prisons we were to be detained until the horrible day of judgment, by turning
them into sleeping places. His three days detention in the grave teaches that
we had deserved, that for our sins death had eternaly reigned over us, if his
ignominious detention had not also satisfied for this punishment.

XXI. They do annihilate the end and fruit of Christ's passion, who say that he
suffered only for this, that he might be an example to us.

It Is true, that Christ by suffering has left us an example; but the mean
fruit of his passion is the satisfaction for our sins. The Socinians
acknowledge Christ a Savior, only in these things 1. In that he preached
celestial Truth. 2. that he confirmed it. 3. That he was our example in his
passion and Resurrection. 4. In that at length he bestows life eternal on us
But when we allege testimonies out of Scripture concerning Christ's death for
us, they elude them by saying, that he died for us, that is, for our good; but
not for us, that is, in our place or stead. But this most pestilent. Heresy is
refuted by these subsequent Arguments. 1. Because he so died for us, that he
gave his life as the price of red^mption for man: Mat. 20 28 who gave himself a
ransom for all. 1. Tim 2.6. that he is said, to redeem us with his precious
blood 1 Pet. 1.18, 19. You are says he, redeemed Now who knows not that it is
one thing to be an example of salvation and freedom, and another thing to pay a
ransom for any? for he that satisfies not for his slave or in his stead, how
does he pay a ransom for him? 2 Because he died so for us, that he was made
sin for us, 2 Cor. 5.21. That he took our sins upon him, and he bore the
punishment due to our sins Isa. 53.4. Is then the taking of another sin upon
him and the suffering of the punishment due to another, only the sh^wing of an
example and not to satisfy and to be punished in his stead? 3. If the
sacr^fices of the Old Testament were offered by the priests for the people, or
in their stead, then Chr^sts sacrifice also was performed in our stead, the
former is true, therefore so is the lat^er. They assert boldly, that in
Scripture there is no example where the particle ( for) is the same that ( in
another stead.) But who sees not this in these subsequent testimonies? Joh
10.11.

The good shepherd lays down his life for his sheep, to wit, by fighting even
to death* in the stead or place of his sheep. Romans 5.7. Scarce will one die for
a just man. Romans 8.26. The Spirit makes intercession for us: and v. 31. If God
be for us, who can be against us? and Romans 9.3. I could wish to be accursed for
my brethren. Neither does the eternity of pain due to our sins make Christ's
Passion an insufficient ransom, in that he suffered not eternally for us:
because the his punishment was not eternal in regard of time. Yet it is
equivalent to eternal pain; both in respect of the infinite majesty and
dignity of Christ's person, as also in consideration of the greatness and
infinite weight of his sufferings, and the b^rthen of Divine wrath which the
wo^ld and all ^he creatures ^herein were not able to endure.

XXII. The Papists do overthrow the same satisfaction of Christ, in setting up
other Priests, and obtruding the Idolatrous Mass for a Sacrifice.

They are refuted by these strong reasons: 1. Because there is one Mediator, 1 Timothy 2 5. 2. Because Paul speaks only of one Priest, Heb. 7.26. Such a high
Priest became us. 3. Because there was offered but one oblation, Heb. 7 27. He
performed that once: and 9.^5. Not that he might offer himself often: and 10.
10. by his offering once made: and verse. 14. By one oblation he has
consecrated forever those that are sanctified, ver. 18 Where there is remission
of sins, there is no more offering for sin. 4. If therefore the Priesthood of
the old Law was abrogated, because the ancient Priests were but weak men; then
it must follow, that none in the New Testament was fit to be a Priest, except
the Son of God Heb. 7.28. For the law makes men high Priests, but the word of
the oath makes the Son. But they use this exception, to wit, that Christ is
the chief High Priest, and themselves secondary, and consequently Christ's
instruments: But either they offer the very same sacrifice which Christ offered
on the Cross, or another: If they offer another, then it must be unfit, for
the reasons alleged: if the same, then these absurdities will follow. 1 That
Christ offered for himself, because these offer for themselves; for the high
Priest, and the inferior Priests will do the same thing, though after a
different way. 2. That they reckon themselves among the torturers who crucified
Christ. 3. Whereas in this oblation the Priest and the Sacrifice are the same
thing, they must be a Sacrifice, at least in the second place: Neither is that
distinction of a bloody, and an unbloody Sacrifice, of greater moment; for so
there should not be one sacrifice, which thwarts the former testimonies; and
remission of sins, should be obtained by an unbloody Sacrifice, which the
Apostle flatly denies Heb. 9 12.

XXIII As then much is detracted from Christ's sufferings by the former errors,
so they extend the object thereof wider than is fitting, who teach that Christ
died universally for all and every one man.

If we look upon the greatness and worth of Christ's merit, it is sufficient to
redeem ten thousand worlds; but if we consider Gods purpose and Christ's
intention, it is false that he died for all and singular. H^nce it is, that he
is said to die for all sufficiently, but not effectually that is to say, that
Christ's merit is sufficient for all in respect of his dignity, but not
effectual in all in respect of application, seeing Christ died to that end,
that his death should be applied to all: for why should he die for those for
who^ he prays not, but he witnesses that he prays not for the world, Ioh.
17 9 Our adversaries urge those places, in which mention is made of the whole
world, also of all men, 1 Timothy 2.4. and 1 Ioh. 2.2. in which also all men,
generally are called. But in 1 Ioh. 2.2. by the name of the whole world,
metonymically are understood, the elect dispersed over all the world. and 1 Timothy 2 4. by all men are meant, as the words following show, all sorts of men,
whether Jews or Gentiles Princes or Peasants; and consequently not every one of
the kinds, but the kinds of every one, in which sense the word All is used,
Genesis 6.19. Joel 2.28.

Perfect Justice, the other part of Christ's satisfaction, is that, whereby in
comforming himself to the Law, and performing perfect obedience thereto, he
has purchased for us the inheritance of life eternal. And this justice is
partly original, partly actual: Original is the conformity of Christ with the
Law: in which he was conceived and born.

The RULES.
I. Original righteousness is opposed to original sin.

II. And this is not a bare innocence or freedom from sin, but an aptitude
also and inclination to goodness.

As Original sin is not only a privation of just^ce, but an inclination also to
evil.

III. Christ's original justice is a part of his Satisfaction for us.

The reasons are, 1. Because the Law requires not only actual obedience, but
also a full conformity with the law, otherwise original contagion were no sin.
2. Because Christ is all ours; and what he was made, or did, or was, he was
made, did, and was for us.

His actual justice, is that obedience, whereby Christ did most perfectly
fulfill the law in the act it self. And this is called in the Schools active
obedience.

The RULES.
I. As Christ's passion was necessary to expiate sin; so was his active
Obedience and justice to obtain life eternal.

Reasons, 1. Because the Law obliges us both to pun^shment, and to obed^ence:
to punishment, because it pronounces him accursed, who does not all the words
of the Law, Deuteronomy. 27* 26. To obedience, because it promises life to them only,
who do perform all things, Lev: 18 5. Who does these things shall live by them
and Luk^ 10.28. Do this and live. Neither does the distinction of Justice into
Legal and Evangelical, h^nder; see^ng the Gospel exhib^ts in Christ the same
Justice which the law requires 2. Because this double satisfaction answers our
double misery; to wit, the guilt of sin and of damnation, and the want of
Justice, Romans 3.22. All have sinned and come short of the glory of God. 3.
Because true Justice properly so called consists in actual obedience Deuteronomy.
6.25. And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all th^se
Commandments before the Lord. 4. Because he performed that actual obedience
either for himself, or in our stead: but not for himself, therefore in our
stead. The assumption is plain, out of that relation which Christ has to us;
for whatsoever he was, or did in all the course of his obedience he was, and
did that in our stead. But they who acknowledge his passive obedience only
satisfactory and meritorious, say that his active obedience makes toward our
Redemption and Salvation, but only as a necessary help, or the cause without
which Salvation could not be obtained: for say they, this active obedience is
required for two causes: First, by the right of Creation; Secondly, that his
Sacrifice might be acceptable to God, and that he might be a holy High Priest.
But the first branch of this opinion is false; for Christ is not in this to be
compared with other men: for as the Son of God was made man, and a creature for
us, not for himself, so he was made A. R. Christ was subject to the Law, that
he might free us from the curse of the Law. 2. That he might take away from the
Jews occasion of calumniating. 3. To show, he was the end of the Law. 4. That
by his example he might invite us to keep the Law.
subject to the law, not for himself, but for us. The later branch confounds
his holiness or innocence, with his obedience or actual justice, which differ as
much as the habit and privation. Innocence indeed is necessarily required in
Christ's Sacrifice; but his actual obedience is not only required in Christ, as
a Priest, but it ^s also a part of his satisfaction and merit: for if Adams
actual disobedience was the merito^ious cause of damnation, why should not the
actual obedience of the second Adam be the meritorious cause of salvation?
except we w^ll say, that the first Adam was more powerful to damn us, then the
second was to save us.

II. The Fathers command which christ obeyed, was special and general, special
in respect of the end, that he should obey not for him self, but for us: But
general in respect of the object; for he was subject to the same Law* which was
prescribed to us, and in all things which the Law enjoined us to.

They who only make Christ passive obed^ence meritorious, pretend that it was
performed so only by a special command from the Father, that he should die for
us. But this were not a special command only, but a partial: For Christ's
obedience does as far extend it self, as the Law does: whereas then the Law
obliges us both to the punishment and to obedience, he did satisfy both these
requisites.

III. Life eternal, is considered, either in it self, as it is a full
participation of celestial joy: or in opposition to damnation, as it is a
freedom from damnation: in the former sense, the perfect Justice of Christ is
the cause of eternal life; but in the latter, the suffering of the punishment,
is the cause of life eternal.

It is one thing to describe Life eternal privative^y, and another thing
positively. To speak properly, there is no other cause of eternal Life, but
perfect justice according to the Law, Do this and live: Yet Christ's death is
called the cause of eternal Life so far as it is a delivery from all evil:
neither is freedom from damnation, and heavenly joys, parts of life, but only
different relations: Hence it is apparent in what sense Christ promises that
he will give his flesh for the life of the world, Ioh. 6.51. Two things here
are objected. 1. If Christ's active obedience is the cause of eternal Life, then
he suffered in vain. 2 If Christ obeyed for us, then we need not yield
obedience. But in the first Argument there is no consequence; for there is one
end, which is common to both parts of satisfaction, to wit, our salvation,
another, proper to each one: for the end of his sufferings was our delivery
from evil; but the end of justice, is the procuring of right to eternal life.
The latter Argument against the merit ^f active obedience, is such a one, as
Socinius frames against the merit of passive obedience: if quoth he, Christ
died in our stead, then we need not ^ie. But there is no consequence in either:
there is one death of Christ, another of the godly: that was joined with a
curse, this with a blessing; Christ did undergo that as the wages of our sins,
but we undergo this as a passage from this life to a ^eav^nly: so there is one
obedience of Christ, another of man; that was perfect justice which he
performed in our stead, to purchase l^fe for us; but this is imperfect, and is
performed to show our gratitude for our redemption.

IV. The active Justice of Christ, in the Old Testament was shadowed out by the
glorious robes of the High Priest as a type.

They who deny the merit of active obedience, ask, by what type it was shad^wed
out? For if, say they, it is a part of the Priests office in what thing did the
High Priest type it out. But to what purpose was all that glorious attiring of
the High Priest in which he appeared before God, if it was not to shadow ou^
Christ's righteousness? Hence we read, that not only were the filthy garments
of Iosuah taken off from him, in sign of our sins removed from us; but that
new garments were put upon him, and a mitter or crown set upon his head Zach.
3.4, 5.

So much of Christ satisfaction: His Intercession in the state of Humiliation
was, whereby he offered Supplications and Prayers, not without tears and
groans, to his Father for us.

The Evangelical story is full of examples, and tells us of whole nigh^s that
Christ spent in prayer: but he performed this office chiefly in the time of his
Passion. Ioh. 17. and H^b 5.7. Who in the days of his flesh offered with
strong cries and tears, supplications and prayers to him, who was able to
deliver him from death.

The RULES.
I. They annihilate Christ's Intercessi^n, who seek other Mediators of
Intercession, as they call them, besides him.

The Pont^ficians distinguish between the Mediator of Redemption, and mediators
of Intercession; and this latter office they ascribe to the departed Saints:
but it is no l^sse sacrilege to ascribe his In^ercession to the secondary
Intercessors, then to impart his sacrifice to Subordinate Priests, and whereas
they fe^gn that the Saints profit us not by their intercession only, but by
their merits also, their distinction falls to the ground* seeing they divide the
glory also of Redemption between Christ and the Saints, while they feign, that
by their merits, as it were by an auxiliary aid, our sins are purged, and the
defect of Christ's passion suppli^d.

Hitherto of his Priestly office: His Regal office he administered in the state
of his his Humiliation, in gathering together a Church by his word and Spirit,
so, that in it their appeared no sign of Regal Majesty.

The RULE.
I. In vain do the Jews dream of the Messiah's corporal and earthly Kingdom.

Isa. 42.2. He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in
the streets, Is. 53.2, 3 But he shall grow up as a branch, and as a root out of
a dry ground: he has neither form nor beauty; when we shall see him, there shall
be no form that we should desire him: he is despised and rejected of men: he is
a man full of sorrows, and has experience of infirmities. We hide as it were
our faces from him; he was despised and we esteemed him not. Zac. 9.9 Beho^d
thy King comes unto thee: he is just, and having salvation poor, and riding
upon an Ass.

CHAP. XIX. Of Christ's Exaltation.
THus of the state of his Humiliation; the state of his Exaltation is that,
wherein Christ being raised from the dead, was exalted to heaven; and being set
down at his Fathers right hand, was crowned with the highest degree of glory,

The RULES.
I. The efficient cause of this Exaltation wa^ (...) whole Trinity.

II. But Christ considered according to dispensation, is the object thereof.

III. The exaltation of Christ's person was according to both natures.

IV. According to his humane nature, he was exalted, by laying aside the
infirmities which he assumed, and by obtaining those gifts which before he
wanted* For he attained as great a perfection both in his body and soul, as the
creature was capable of.

V. He was exalted according to his divine nature, not by accession of any
dignity to it, being considered in it self; but by the manifestation of that
majesty, which before was hid under the form of a Servant.

VI. A. R. It is said here, that Christ obtained his exaltation by his
obedience, not by the way of merit. It is true, that Christ as God cannot
merit: Nor, 2. did he merit the grace of union as man; for that was infinitely
more than man o^ Angels could merit, Nor 3. did he merit by the act of freewill
in his conception, that plenitude of grace and knowledge which was infused into
him: Nor, 4. did he merit any thing, which was not due to him in respect of the
Personal union. Yet we may not de^y, but that he merited whatsoever honor was
conferred on him before his death, and likewise his exaltation after his
resurrection: for so the Apostle shows, that because Christ humbled himself,
and became obedient to the death of the cross, therefore God exalted him,
Phil. 2.9, 10, 11. He shall drink of the brook in the way, therefore shall he
lift up his head, Ps. 107. Therefore S. Austin in Joh tract. 104 calls Christ's
humility the merit of his glory, and his glory, the reward of his humility.
This glory then was Christ's due, both in respect of the personal union, and
also in respect of merit: for why may not a thing ^e due in a double respect.
Christ attained to this exaltation by his obedience, not as it were by merit,
but as it were by the means or way.

VII. The end hereof was to witness, that he faithfully performed the office
enjoined him in his humiliation, and to manifest his divine power by which he
does powerfully apply his merit to us.

The parts or degrees of this are three: His Resurrection, his Ascension to
Heaven, and his sitting at the Fathers right hand.

His Resurrection was the first degree of exaltation, by which Christ having
overcome the power of death, was raised the third day, in that very flesh which
he had laid down, that he might live to God for ever.

The RULES.
I. Christ was not only the object, but also the efficient cause of his
resurrection

Romans 1.4. Being declared with power to be the Son of God, according to the
Spirit of sanctification, by the resurrection from the dead. 1 Pe^. 3.18. He
died concerning the flesh, but was quickened in the Spirit.

II. The matter of the Resurrection is ^he same body that was crucified, but
^ndowed and glorified with new qua^ities.

III. Neither was it so changed, as to lose its quantity and three dimensions.

For otherwise it had been no body, not had Christ remained man in his
Resurrection.

IV. The Form consists in a new and indivisible union of soul and body.

V. Although Christ's Resurrection was altogether miraculous, yet it is false
that his body passed through the stone which covered the grave, or that it
passed through the door, after his Resurrection.

Matt. 28 2* The Angel of the Lord rolled a way the stone. Joh. 20.19. The
doors being shut, not through the doors that were shut.

VI The end of his Resurrection, besides that general end which was mentioned
before, is the assurance of our Resurrection both from the death of sin, as
also from death corporal.

Rom 6.1, 2. etc. and 1* Cor. 15.12, etc.

His ascension into Heaven was the second degree of his Exaltation, in which
Christ after he had conversed forty days with his Disciples upon Earth,
ascended into Heaven.

The RULES.
I. Christ ascended both according to his divine and humane nature: according
to his humane, as the object; according to his divine, as the efficient cause.

II. The form consists in Christ's real and local translation from this World
to the highest Heaven.

III. Here we need not trouble our selves about penetrat^on of bodies; both
because Heaven is not a solid, thick, or iron body, as the Philosophers would
have it; as also because one body can easily yield to another, and the creature
to the Creator.

IV. The doctrine of Christ's corporal presence here on Earth, does utterly
overthrow that of his ascension.

V The special end of Christ's ascension, is to assure us of our threefold
ascension: the first is, of faith and godliness in this life; the second, of
our souls in death; the third, of body and soul in the last day.

The sitting of Christ at his Fathers right hand, is the highest degree of his
Exaltation, by which being placed in Heaven, he is exalted above all power.

Ephesians. 1.20.21.22, He has set him at his right hand in the heavenly places, far
above all principa^ities and powers, and might and dominion, and every name
that is named, no^ in this world only, but in that also which is to come, and
has made all things subject under his feet, and has appointed him over a^l
things to be the head to his Church, which is his body, and the fullness of him
that fills all in all things.

The RULES.
I. To sit at Gods right hand, is to have the next power after God.

After the manner of Kings, who use to set them on their right hand, to whom
they will give the chief honor next to themselves. Psalm. 45.10. The Queen is at
thy right hand. 1 King 2.19. When Ba^^sheba came to Solomon to speak unto him
for Adoniiah, the king rose to meet her, and bowed himself to her, and sat down
on his Throne, and he caused a seat to be ^et for the kings mother, and she sat
at his right hand, Matt. 20.21. Command that my two Sons may sit, the one at
thy right hand, the other at thy left in thy kingdom.

II. Christ according to both Natures sits at Gods right hand.

III. The Humanity was so exalted, that yet it was not made equal to the
divinity: he received glory above all creatures, yet not equal to that
essential glory which he has in common with the Father and the Holy Ghost.

In this highest degree of Exaltation, Christ has not left to do his office:
He performs his Prophetical office by furnishing his Ministers with gifts, of
old extraordinarily, but now by ordinary means, propagating his Gospel through
all the World with most happy success.

Ephesians 4.11. Some he gave to be Apostles, etc.

His Priestly Office he exercises, not in offering himself again, or in
casting himself with cries and sighs at his Fathers knees; but in appearing
before his Father for us, with the merits of his most full satisfaction, and in
applying the same effectually to us.

Psalm. 110.4. The Lord has sworn, and will not repent, thou art a priest for
ever, after the order of Melchisedek. Heb. 9.24. He has not entered into the
Sanctuary made with hands, which are similitudes of the true Sanctuary, but is
en^red into the very Heaven to appear now in the sight of God for us.

Lastly, He uses Kingly office not only by ruling the Triumphant Church, but
also by gathering together the Militant Church, by preserving, protecting and
delivering it, as also by overthrowing the Enemies thereof.

Psalm. 110 1. The Lord said to my Lord, sit thou at my right hand, until I make
thine Enemies thy foot. stool.

The RULES.
I. This Kingdom of Christ is not that essential; which from eternity he
obtained with the Father and Holy Ghost; but a personal, donative and
ecumenical, which as our Head and Mediator he had of the Father.

II. Yet he has for ever administered this ecumenical Kingdom.

2 Samuel 7.13. I will establish the throne of his Kingdom for ever, Dan. 7.14.
whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass a way. Luk,
1.33* of his Kingdom there shall be no end: The words of the Father to Christ
do not oppose these sayings, until I make thine enemies, etc. For the meaning
is not, that Christ after his last coming shall reign no more; but it shows
this at least, that it shall come to pass that he shall subdue all his Enemies:
For that clause until, and the like, exclude not the future time, but they are
affirmatively and negatively spoken of it, and oftentimes they signify the
same, that always or never: for example, Genesis 28.15. I will not forsake thee,
until I have performed that which I spoke to thee. 2 Samuel 6.23. Michal had no
child till the day of her death. Matthew. 1. 25. He knew her not until she had
brought forth her first begotten Son. Matthew. 28.20. Behold I am with you till
the end of the World; nor is this saying against us, 1 Cor. 15.24* 28. where it
is affirmed, That Christ will deliver up the Kingdom to his Father, then shall
the Son also himself be subject unto him, that God may be al in all: For in
that place, the delivering up of the Kingdom is not a laying down of Christ's
Regal office; but by the Kingdom there is meant (as commonly in Scripture) the
Church; he will then deliver the Kingdom to his Father, when he shall present the
whole Church to him: therefore that subjection shall not abolish Christ's
Kingdom; whereas Christ even as Mediator is subordinate to his father in
glory, so Christ shall be and shall remain our King, that notwithstanding he
will with us subject himself to the Father. But you will say, that already he
is subject to the Father* That is true indeed, but not simply; for n^w the Head
with the Church is subjected, yet not all the Church; but then together with
all the members of the Church, and consequently all mystical Christ shall be
subjected to the Father. That finally God is said to be all in all, it is not
so to be understood, as if he were not at this day all in all, or that then he
were only to reign: but but this is spoken after the Scripture phrase, in
which, things are oftentimes said to be done, when they are declared to be: The
meaning then is, whereas in this World the Kingdom of God is annoyed and
obscured by the Enemies thereof, these Enemies being at last subdued, it will
be most apparent that the Kingdom will be Gods, and his Christ's.

CHAP. XX. Of the common Vocation to the state of Grace.
HItherto of Christ the Redeemer, who is the efficient cause of the state of
Grace: Now follows the Vocation to the same.

This is either common to the elect and reprobate, or proper only to the elect.

The common calling is, whereby all men are invited to the state of Grace, and
participation of Christ the Mediator.

This is also called the election of the whole people wheresoever. Deuteronomy. 7.6.
Thou art a holy people to the Lord thy God, he has chosen thee.

The RULES.
I. As election so vocation is either to an office, or to salvation: the latter
is that which is here to be considered.

There is an example in Saul of Election and Vocation* to an office 1 Samuel
10.24. Do you not see wh^m the Lord has chosen?

II. The efficient cause of this vocation is commonly the whole blessed
Trinity: but particularly Christ the Lord; who as in the days of his
ministration here on earth, did immediately call sinners, so he does now by the
means of his ministers

Matthew. 22.2, 3. The kingdom of heaven is like unto a king who made a marriage
for his son, and sent his servants who should call those that were invited to
the wedding etc. Mark 1.14 15. Jesus came to Galilee preaching the Gospel of
God, and saying, the time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand,
Repent and believe the Gospel. 2 Cor. 5.20. Therefore we are Ambassadors for
Christ, etc.

III. The matter of this vocation are not all men, nor the elect only, but any
of the race of mankind.

That all are not called, the whole History of the old Testament witnesses;
for God at that time passing by other Nations called the people of Israel: but
in the time of the New Testament, not all, no^ every one is called; seeing that
many never heard of Christ. And that the elect only are not called, the
parable of Christ does sufficiently witness, in which good and bad are invited;
many also are said to be called, but few chosen: Matt. 22 10 14 Now all sorts
of men are called, of what state, condition, age etc. they be.

IV. The form of this vocation consists partly in the proffer of the benefit
of Redemption, and partly in the precept of accepting it.

2. Cor 5.20. Therefore we are Ambassadors for Christ, as though God did
beseech you through us, we pray in Christ stead, that ye be reconciled to God.
For he has made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made
the righteousness of God in him.

V. The end of this is Gods glory, and the salvation of the Elect: now the
glory of Gods mercy is seen in the elect obeying the vocation, and the glory of
his Justice in the reprobate disobeying.

VI. Common vocation is principally for the Elect, secondarily for the
Reprobate.

VII. Yet both are called seriously, and without hypocrisy.

Of the Elect there is no doubt; as for the reprobate, although they are not
called with any purpose in God to save them yet they are called seriously, and
salvation is seriously promised to them, on condition they will believe:
neither are they mocked in that they are deprived of the grace of faith; but
because voluntarily they fell from their original grace, and with a malicious
purpose they despise the means of salvation: God notwithstanding may justly
claim Faith of them; and this right of claim which he has, he does as justly
use as any other creditor, that their mouths may be stopp^d, and they made
inexcusable, and Gods justice may be vindicated: therefore he does not call
them, that he might mock them, but that he might declare and make manifest his
justice upon them.

VIII. Therefore out of the common vocation, we must not presently infer an
election: both because it is common to the Elect and Reprobate, as also because
it includes the condition of Faith.

Although a whole nation is said to be elected, yet all in that nat^on are not
elected: as the Jewish people are called an elect people, and yet many of them
were reprobates.

IX. Neither are all therefore elected, because they are commanded to believe
that they are elected; for they are not absolutely commanded to believe that,
but with trial of their Faith.

2 Cor. 13.5. Try your selves whether yo^ be in the Faith or not; prove your
selves: know ye not your own selves how that Jesus Christ is in you, except
ye be reprobates? but I trust, that ye shall know, that we are not reprobates.

CHAP. XXI. Of the Covenant of Grace.
THe fruit and benefit of Vocation, is the outward communion both of the
covenant of Grace, as also of the Church.

The external communion of the Covenant of Grace, is whereby they who are
called, are accounted to be in the covenant, and Gods people yet analogically,
as some are truly Gods people, some only in outward profession.

In the Covenant of grace we must consider both the offering of it and the
confirming or sealing of it: the offering of the Covenant of Grace, is that
whereby God promises to the elect to be their Father in Christ, if they
perform filial obedience.

The RULES.
I. By the name of Covenant we understand not that general, which God made with
all creatures; nor the covenant of works made with our first parents, but that
which after the fall, God of his mere mercy has made with us

II. Therefore the covenant of Grace is called a Testament or ^isposition,
because by this, God has appointed to his sons an heavenly inheritance, to be
obtained by the mediation of his own Sons death.

H^b* 8.10. Therefore this is the Covenant that I will make, etc. and Chap.
9.15, 16. And for this cause he is the Medi^tor of the New- Testament, that
through death which was for the redemption of ^he transgressions that were in
the form^r Testament, they which were called might receive the promise of
eternal inheritance: for where a Testament is, there must needs be the death of
him that made the Testament.

III. The efficient cause of this is c^mmonly the Holy Trinity: but
particularly christ, God and man, that Angel of the covenant.

Mal. 3.1. Beho^d I will send my Angel, (to wit John Baptist) who shall prepare
the way before me; and the Lord whom you shall seek, shall suddenly come to his
Temple, even the Angel of the Covenant, whom you desire.

IV. The matter of the Covenant of Grace, are the things conditioned on both
sides; to wit, of God and man God promises that he will be our God in Christ;
man promises the obedience of Faith and life

V. The former consists in a mutual obligation; but so that they are
Relatives of an unequal nature; for the promise and obligation on Gods part is
free, but on man's part it is a due debt

VI. The end of the Covenant is the same that is of the general vocation, Gods
glory, and the salvation of the Elect.

VII. The subject or object of this proffered Covenant, are all that be called;
but properly the Elect only

This Cov^nant is proffered to all that are called, but the the Elect only
enjoy the Promises of the Covenant*

VIII. Out of the adjuncts, we are to consider the administration of the
Covenant of Grace.

IX. The administration, in respect of time is distinguished into the old and
new league, or testament

X. The old Testament is the Covenant of Grace, administered in the time wherein
Christ was to be exhibited.

XI. The form of this Administration was threefold: 1. from Adam to Abraham. 2
from Abraham to Moses: 3. from Moses to Christ.

XII. Between the first and last form of administration, this difference is, 1.
That that was made by words of promise, which were very short, and yet long
enough; but this has not only a promise, but an express condition of
Obedience also. 2. That had only the ceremony of Sacrifices; but this also of
Circumcision. 3. That was proposed to all mankind; but this was tied only to
Abraham's posterity

XIII* Between the administration of the form in the third, and two former,
this is the difference; that the third is more perfect, and truly testamentary,
because enlarged not only with the Passover, but also with many other types
of Christ's death.

XIV. The New Testament is the covenant of Grace, which is administered, Christ
being exhibited,

XV. The New and Old Testament agree in substance: for in both Christ is the
same Testator; in both is the same Promise of Grace in Christ; in both is
required the same obedience of faith and life.

XVI. They are deceived then who make Parallel distinctions of the Old and New
Testament; of the Covenant of Works, and of Grace; of the Law, and Gospel: for
in both, the Testament or Covenant is the Covenant of Grace; in both, the Law
and Gospel are urged.

XVII. But the administration of the Old and New Testament differ first in
time; because the Old Testament was exhibited before Christ; but the New is
administered, Christ being now exhibited; that was to continue only till
Christ, this for ever. 2 In place or amplitude, for that was proffered to the
people of Israel only, this extends it self through all the world. 3. In
clearness; because the free promises of Christ are more clearly preached in
the New Testament, and confirmed, the shadows of Types and Ceremonies being
abolished. 4 In facility; because the administration in the Old Testament, was
more laborious than in the New. 5. In sweetness; for in the Old Testament, the
perfect obedience of the Law is oftener urged, yet not excluding the promises
of the Gospel; yet to that end, that they might be compelled to seek Christ by
that rigorous exaction of obedience, as it were by a Schoolmaster: but in the
new Testament, the promises of the Gospel are more frequent, yet not excluding
the Law, which drives us to new obedience, to be performed by the grace of
Regeneration.

XVIII. Hence then it is manifest, in what sense the new Covenant is opposed to
the old, in Jeremiah.

Jer. 31.31, 32. Behold the days come, says the Lord; in which I will make a
new Covenant with the house of Israel, and the house of Judah; not according to
the Covenant which I made with their Fathers when I took, etc. and v. 33. But
this shall be the Covenant etc I will put my law in their inward parts, and
write is in their hearts. v. 34. And they shall teach no more every one his
neighbor, etc. they shall know me from the least to the greatest. In these
words, regard is had to the third and fifth difference: to this, when mention
is made of the law written in Tables of stone, and afterward to be written in
their hearts* but to that, when he promises a clearer knowledge.

CHAP. XXII. Of the Seals or Sacraments of the Covenant of Grace in general.
HAving spoken of the Covenant proffered to us; now follows the Confirmation
thereof by Sacraments, as it were by Seals of the Covenant of Grace

A Sacrament is a Sacred action instituted by God, in which that grace which
Christ has promised to the Covenanters is sealed by visible signs on Gods
part, and they are tied on their part to obedience

The RULES.
I. The word Sacrament, which of old was used for a military Oath, or for money
deposited in stead of a pledge by those who were in suit of law, is not unfitly
applied in the Church to the signs of Grace.

For by Sacraments, as it were by solemn oaths, we are bound to observe what is
promised in the Covenant; and the same are to us pledges of grace promised in
the Covenant.

II. It is called also a Mystery, as it signifies some secret and divine thing
proposed in signs and types: yet the word Mystery is further extended, than the
word Sacrament: seeing every sacrament is a mystery, but all mysteries are not
sacraments.

III. Sacrament sometimes is taken properly for the whole action, as it
contains both the sign, and thing signified; but Synecdochically it is only
taken for the sign.

IV. According to the first sense it is already designed; but in the other
sense it is defined a visible sign of an invisible grace.

V. The principal efficient cause is commonly the whole Trinity; but
particularly Christ that Angel of the Covenant.

VI. The instruments of administration, are the Ministers lawfully called.

VII. The instrument by which the Sacraments are effected, or by which the
signs are consecrated, is the Word of Institution, consisting chiefly of two
parts, to wit, a precept of the due administration and receiving; and a promise
of the fruitful efficacy of Sacraments.

VIII. The word of institution does not change the quality, or substance of the
elements, but only their use, and that not by any secret virtue inherent in the
words themselves, as the Papists say, but by Gods ordination.

As a stone by the Magistrates appointment is changed into a landmark, the
substance and qualities thereof still remaining: so, as Austin says, the Word
being joined to the element, it becomes a Sacrament, the quality and substance
remaining, only the common use is changed into a sacred.

IX. It is false also which they teach, That the Ministers intention is of such
absolute necessity, that without this there can be no Sacrament.

For if the Sacrament depend not more on Gods institution, than on the
Ministers intention; wretched consciences will be deprived of all comfort* who
know not the Ministers thoughts whilst he administers.

X They do also foolishly set in opposition the Word preached, and the Word of
Institution; for these differ not really, but in some respect only seeing a
Sermon is but the explication of the Word: therefore the Word of Institution
belongs to the ^ss^nce of of the Sacrament, but the Word Preached to the manner
of administration.

XI. The outward and terrene matter of the Sacrament, is the visible Sign or
Element.

XII. The inward or heavenly matter, is the thing signified, to wit Christ with
all his benefits.

XIII. The external form consists in the lawful administration and
participation of the Sacrament according to Gods command.

XIV. The internal form is the analogy of the sign and thing signified.

XV. Therefore the union of the sign, and thing signified, is not physical or
local, but habitual, as the sign represents the thing signified; and while the
sign is given by the Minister, the faithful receive the thing signified from
Christ.

XVI. Yet we deny not the presence of Christ, and of his body and blood, in the
action of the Sacrament: for besides that he is present in his Divine Person,
he is not wanting in the presence of his Spirit to his own body and blood, not
locally, but sacramentally.

There is a threefold presence, besides that which is local. 1. Symbolical;
when things are represented to the mind by some sign or symbol, as things by
words or voices, man by his image. 2. Spiritual when we represent to our
selves, by faith some spiritual thing nor present; as Abraham represented to
himself and saw the day of Christ, Ioh. 8.56. 3. A Virtual, when that which is
distant in place, is present in power and efficacy: as the Sun. These three
ways of Presence meet in the Sacrament: for the body and blood of Christ are
present to us, 1. Symbollically, as they are represented by an external sign.
2. Spiritually, as we apply by faith, to our selves Christ's body and blood with
his merits. 3. Virtually, as we perceive the fruit thereof by faith in our
hearts. The first degree of Sacramental presence, belongs also to infidels; the
second and third, to the faithful only. Therefore although Christ's body by
local presence is far distant from the symbol, as heaven is from earth, yet
there is a sacramental presence. Presence is not opposed to distance, but to
absence.

XVII, Neither are therefore Sacraments empty signs, because the symbol and
thing signified are not locally united; for there remain notwithstanding, 1.
The signs signifying, 2. Exhibiting, 3. Applying, 4. Sealing.

We must carefully observe these four sorts of signs, against those who cry
out that we have nothing in the Sacraments but empty signs. Signs then are
either significant only, as a painted image signifies a man; or exhibiting
also, as a scepter, keys, and such like, which being exhibited, regal power is
also conferred, and leave to enter the house: or they are besides applying
signs, as that promise of God to preserve the 144000. this the Angel applies
to each one, by setting a mark on his forehead Rev. 7.3. Or lastly, they are
confirming and sealing signs, as earnests, seals, and such like. Now these four
degrees meet in Sacraments: for, 1. The outward symbols do signify and
represent Christ's body and blood. 2. Together with the sign, the thing
signified is exhibited; yet not in the sign, but in the Sacramental action;
the Minister exhibiting the sign, and Christ the things signified. 3. The
thing signified generally prom^sed to the faithful in the Gospel, by the
exhib^tion of the sign is applied to every one of the faithful. 4. The same
promise is confirmed by the Sacrament; whence they are not only called signs
but seals also, Romans 4.11.

XVIII. From the union and relation of the thing signified, with the sign;
there arises a sacramental phrase or speech, in which the thing signified is
predicated of the sign: In this manner of speech is expressed what these
outward signs signify, rather than what they are in themselves, or in their
own nature.

Gen* 17. 19. Circumcision by a sacramental phrase; is called the Covenant: but
v. 11. properly, the S^gn of the Covenant* Exodus ^2.11 the Lamb is called the
Passover: which place is vindicated from our Adversaries exceptions by the
like sayings, Mar. 14.12. And the first day of unleavened ^read when they
killed the passover, Luc. 22.7. The day of unleavened bread cam^, in which the
Passover was to be killed. ver. 8. Go and prepare the Passover for us, that
we may eat. ver: 11. There is an Inn, where I must eat the Passover with my
Disciples* and v. 12. There prepare the passover verse, 15. I have desired to
eat this Passover with you. To this purpose serve all those places, in which
Expiation is attributed to sacrifices, and purification to water and washings;
also in which the name Jehovah is given to the Ark* or to Jerusalem, Psalm.
47.6. Ezekiel. 48.35. Like testimonies are in the New Testament. Mat. 26.26, 27,
28. While they were eating, Jesus took bread; and when he had blessed, brake
it, and gave it to his Disciples, saying; Take eat* this is my body: lik^wise,
taking the cup* and having given thanks, he gave to them, saying, D^^nk ye all
of this, for this is the blood of the New Testament, etc. See the like places
in Mark, Luke, and 1 Cor. 11. so 1 Cor. 10.4. And the Rock was Christ. Ephesians.
5.26. That he might sanctify his Church, having purged her with the washing of
water. Col. 2. v. 12. ^eing buried with him in baptism. Heb. 9.13. For if the
blood of bulls, and of goats, and the ashes of an he^fer; sprinkling the
unclean, sanctifies to the purifying of the flesh. Yea, the very same is seen
in other speeches, besides sacramental, as Genesis 4^.27. The seven cows, are
seven years; that is, types, and figures of seven years* R^velations, 17, 9.
The seven heads, are even hills; and verse 12. The ^on horns, are ten Kings.

XIX. This kind of speaking, is called a Sacramental Metonymie of the thing
signified, for the sign. Now it is not material whether the trope be in the
attribute, or in the copula, or coupling of the words; for though the trope may
be in the attribute, yet the cause or ground of the trope is in the copula.

The material cause of a simple enunciation. consists in the subject and
attribute; but the copula being affirmed or denied, makes up the formal part by
which it becomes true or false, Proper or figurative: for as often as things of
different natures are affirmed or joined by the copula, that speech is false or
tropical, the seal therefore of the trope is in the predicate; but the cause
thereof is in the copula Whereas then the copula (is) in this enuntiation, This
is my body, conjoints things of different natures, to wit bread and ^hrists
body: necessari^y the speech must be false, but to say so were blasphemy; or
else tropical: Therefore the interpretation of such speeches is plain: bread is
the body of Christ, that is a Sacrament of his body: Circumcision is Gods
covenant, that is, a sign or sacrament thereof seven kine are seven years: that
is figures of seven years, so we are said to be cleansed with water
sacramentally, because baptism or washing is the sacrament of cleansing: so
sacramentally, the sacrifices of the Old Testament are said to expiate, because
they were tipes of expiation by Christ,

XX. The end of Sacraments; is the sealing of the Covenant of Grace.

XXI. The effects of the Sacrament, are not justification or sanctification, as
if it were by the work wrought; but the confirmation and sealing of both
benefits

This is plain, by the example of Abraham, who before he was circumcised was
justified, Romans 4.11. Therefore the Pontificians falsely affirm that the
Sacraments confer remission of sins, and such like benefits, by their own
inward virtue out of the work wrought: These Places then of Scripture, in which
such things are spoken of the Sacraments, are to be expounded by a Sacramental
Metonymie, as is said.

XXII. Sacraments are common to all that are in the covenant, in respect of the
signs; but proper to the Elect, in respect of the thing signified

XXIII. Sacraments are necessary to salvation, not simply and absolutely, as if
they were the prime causes thereof? but hypothetically as they are ordinary
means of salvation to be used, as Christ has commanded.

Hence says Bernard; Not the want, but the contempt damneth.

XXIV: The Word and Sacraments agree in substance? for what the testament
promises, the seal confirms: but they differ, 1. In that the word is
received by the ear, the Sacraments perceived by the eye, so that the Sacrament
is a visible word. 2. Because the word of the Gospel is general; but by the
Sacrament, the promises of the Gospel are applied to every believer. 3. Because
by the Word, faith is ordinarily begot; and confirmed by the Sacrament.

Sacraments are of the Old Testament, or of the New. Of the Old Testament,
there were two principal and ordinary; to wit, Circumcision, and the Passover.

Of these we have handled in the doctrine of the Ceremonial Law.

Of the New Testament, there are two; Baptism, and the Lords Supper.

The RULES.
I. The Sacraments of the Old and New Testament agree in the thing s^gnified,
in respect of substance, to wit, Christ with his benefits, which is the kernel
of all the Sacraments.

Heb. 13.8. Jesus Christ yesterday, and to day is the same, and for ever. Rev.
13.8. The Lamb slain from the beginning of the world; to wit sacramentally, in
the sacrifices and Passover.

II. Baptism does answer Circumcision analogically; so does the Lords Supper
the Passover: For as Circumcision was the Sacrament of initiation, or of
ingrafting into the Covenant of regeneration, or spiritual circumcision, so is
Baptism; And as the Passover was the Sacrament of spiritual food, even so is
the Lords Supper. Hence the Holy Supper succeeded the celebration of the last
Passover.

III. The difference between the Sacraments of the Old and New Testament,
consists. 1. In external signs. 2. In the manner of signifying; for there
was signified, that christ was to be exhibited; here exhibited 3. In number:
For besides Circumcision and the Passover, they had also other Sacraments; We
have none besides Baptism and the Lords Supper. 4. In amplitude; for the
New Covenant does not extend it self to one and the same people. 5. In
continuance; for those continued only till Christ's first coming, but these
remain to the end of the World. 6. In clearness.

IV. The difference then which the Pontificians feign, is false; ^. That the
Sacraments of the Old Testament were types of the Sacraments of the New
Testament. 2. that the Sacraments of the Old Testament did only shadow out
justifying grace; but that ours have really in themselves the Body of spiritual
good things.

As for the first d^ff^rence; it is one thing to be a type of Christ, and
another thing to be types of the Sacraments in the New Testament. That
Circumcision and the Passover were types of Christ, is said; but that they
were types of our Sacraments I deny* ^or it were most absurd to think, that
they were instituted only to represent ours. The other d^fference also is
false: for both in those Sacraments, and in these Christ with his benefits are
the matt^r and marrow. But the diff^rence between the Sacrament of the O^d and
New Testament is rather this; that they were shadows of ^pi^itual good things,
whereof Christ was the body, Col. 2.17.

V. Neither will it follow that therefore the Sacraments of the New Testament
are not better than these of Old, because they do not confer justifying grace
for the work wrought: for their prerogatives remain, as they are expressed in
the third Rule, chiefly the second and sixth

Here it is wont to be objected, that if we acknowledge not this their
fict^tious difference, the Sacraments of the Old Testament will be clearer than
these of the New; for the Passover represents Christ's death, clearer than the
Bread in the Lords Supper. But we must know wherein the clarity of a Sacrament
consists chiefly; to wit, not in external signs only, but in the
Sacramental word. Now are not these words very clear: This is my body, which is
given for you; This is my blood which is shed for you? There is nothing so
plain concerning Christ's death, in the Passover. Besides, it is false, that
the killing of a Lamb was a clearer sign; because many more and obscure
ceremonies were added to the killing of the Lamb; as also because the breaking
of Bread* the pouring out of Wine, and the receiving of both, do most clearly
represent the breaking of Christ's Body, the shedding of his blood, and the
participation of both.

VI. In vain do the Pontificians reckon among the Sacraments of the
New Testament, Confirmation, ^enance, Extreme Unction, Ordination of Ministers,
and Matrimony.

Three thnigs are required to a Sacrament. 1. That it be instituted by God
under the Covenant of Grace. 2. That it may have an external Symbol ordained by
God. 3. That the Promise of grace may be annexed to it. Now these three belong
only to Baptism and the Lords Supper, and not to any of the rest. Confirmation
is a Popish ceremony, in which the Bishop or his Suffragan having asked certain
questions of the party baptized, concerning the Heads of Religion, besmears him
with a little ointment, putting a linen cloth on him, not to be removed by the
witnesses before the third day; and he cuffs him, the better to remember the
matter, and that he may be sufficiently furnished with the holy Ghost against
Satan's tentations. But where in Scripture do we read of the institution of this
Sacrament, and of its ceremonies? where is the Promise? We may more truly call
this the Popes excrement; than a Sacrament and that mark which the Beast puts
upon the forehead of his worshippers, Rev. 13.16* Therefore impiously do they
prefer this Sacrament to Baptism; for they teach plainly, that Baptism is
perfected by it, and that in this there is a great^r measure of spiritual gifts
than in Baptism: and whereas any Priest or Pastor may administer Baptism, yea
any Lay man, or woman; Confirmation must only be performed by the Bishop or
his Suffragan. Penance is a Sacrament with them, in which the sinner having
given trial of his repentance, is absolved by the Priest. We indeed
acknowledge that repentance is enjoined to sinners, and that power of absolving
is given to Ministers; though they feign a far other penance and absolution, as
shall appear hereafter: But in the mean while, there is no outward symbol
instituted by God which has a promise; neither can these words, [ I absolve
thee] be in stead of a symbol, as Bellarmine would have it. Extreme Unction is
a Sacrament amongst them, in which the Priest having rehearsed some Letanies,
anointeth the party that is dying, with hallowed oil of the Olive, in those
parts of the body, where the seats of the five Senses are; and this he does
after the parties confession and absolution, to the end he may recover his
health, if it be expedient for him, and that the remainder of his sins, after
he has received the other Sacraments, may be wiped away. Christ indeed
promised his Disciples, that the sick, on whom they were to lay their hands,
should recover, Mar. 16.18. James also commanded that the sick should be
anointed; after imposing of hands and prayer by the Elders: which ceremonies
were not Sacraments, but voluntary rites joined with miracles, which together
with the gifts of miracles are expired. Therefore between extreme Unction, and
this, there is no similitude: For, that I may say nothing of that magical
exorcism with which the oil is hallowed, it is certain, that in the Apostles
time, not only dying people (as now in Popery) but any also that were sick;
were anointed. Ordination is a Sacrament among them, in which the Bishop alone
or his Suffragan lays his hands upon the Minister, and delivers to him with
solemn words a Book, a Platter, a a Pastoral staff, etc. using also the
ceremonies of Unction and Shaving, and imprints on him an indeleble character,
to confer Justifying grace. Whereby he might rightly use the power of the
Keys. Now although Ministers may be ordained by imposition of hands and
prayers, after the example of the Apostles, yet this Imposition is a thing
indifferent: but for the Popish ceremonies, they are partly Jewish, as
anointing, partly Heathenish, as shaving, expressly forbid, Lev. 19 27 Marriage
is no Sacrament of the Covenant of grace, both because it was instituted before
the fall, as also because it is Common to all that are within and without the
Covenant: yet we deny not but that Marriage is a representation of that
spiritual wedlock between Christ and his Church; but if for this it were a
Sacrament, then there should be so many Sacraments, as there be Parables and
Allegories. Hence diverse Schoolmen have denied this to be a Sacrament: And in
what esteem it is among the Papists, appears by this that they make an
irreconcilable war between Marriage and O^dination, and forbid Marriage in
their Clergy* as if it were an unclean thing.

CHAP. XXIII. Of Baptism.
Baptism is the first Sacrament of the new Testament, in which the Elect being
received into the family of God, remission of sins, and regeneration in
Christ's blood, and the Holy Ghost, are confirmed by the outward sprinkling of
water.

The RULES.
I. The word Baptism signifies a dipping and aspersion, or wash^ng.

That it signifies aspersion, appears in Mar. 7.4. And when they come from the
Market, they eat no^, except they be w^sh^d.

II. Here are four appellations of Baptism to be considered. ^. The Baptism
of water Matthew. 3.11. I baptize you with water.
. 2. Of light or doctrine Matthew. 21.25. The baptism of John (that is, all his
ministry, both of doctrine and baptism) whence was it? and Act. 18.25. Appollo
knew only the baptism of John.
3. Of the Spirit, or gifts of the Spirit Act. 1.5. ye shall be baptized with
the Holy Ghost. Matthew. 20.22.
. 4. Of blood or martyrdom Can ye be baptized with the Baptism wh^rewith I am
baptized?
.

III. Christ our Lord is the principal efficient cause; but the instrumental,
is the Minister lawfully called.

IV. Therefore we hold not that baptism lawful, which is administered by any
private man or a woman as in Popery.

For if in earthly Commonwealths that is not accounted of, which a private man
does without command; how much less can Christ be pleased with such disorder
in his Church?

V. A. R. The outward matter of Baptism is water.] I will here add the reasons
why water is used in Baptism. 1. Because the dipping in water represents
Christ's death and burial, and withal our mortification; so the rising out of
the water is a shadow of his resurrecti^n, and our spiritual vivification. 2.
Water is a cheap and common element, therefore obvious, and easily obtained. 3.
In the beginning the spirit moved on the waters, and was the cause of
generation; so in the baptism of water and the spirit, is effected our
regeneration. 4. Water washes away the filth of the body, so does baptism the
spots of the soul. I will pour upon you clear water, and you shall be cleansed
from all your iniquities, Ezekiel. 36. by this water, Ephesians. 5. Christ cleanses his
Church. 5. Water quenches the thirst of the body, so does Baptism the thirst
of the soul. 6. water cooles the heat of the body, so does baptism the beat of
Gods wrath, and the fire of our lusts, 7. Baptism is the Sacrament of
illumination, H^b 6 4 and 10.32. Therefore (...) to illuminate, is used for
baptising; and bap^^ sm is called (...) illumination; and the days of baptism
we^e called the days (...) of light. Now water is a diaphar^nt ^ody, by which
light is transmitted to us, so ^s mental illumination by the water of bapti^m,
in which now we are not dipped, but besprinkled, which is all one: for the
g^fts of the Spirit are expressed by the sprinkling of clear water, in Ezekiel,
and by the sprinkli^g of water in the old purifications, and by the sprinkling
of the Lambs blood in the Passover, to which the Apostle alludes, Heb. 10.
having our hearts besprinkled from an evil con^cience.
The outward matter is water: But for oil, salt, spittle, and other things
which Papists join to this element, belong rather to the profanation, than
administration of baptism.

VI The internal matter is Christ, with his death, burial and resurrection
with other benefits.

VII. It Is external form consists partly in actions, partly in words.

VIII. The action is the aspersion of water; which is used for dipping.

The dipping in, and rising out of the water, was a clear symbol of Christ's
burial and resurrection: But because of the weakness o^ Infan^s, in cold
countries, we use sprinkling; which probably was used by the Apostles, when
they bapt^zed in priva^e families.

IX It is not much material, whether one aspersion or three be used: so it be
void of superstition, and that it be not performed drop by drop, or by the
finger, but so that the symbol may answer the sprinkling or washing.

X. The word by which Baptism is to be administered, is to be comprehended in
Christ's institution, especially in these words; I baptize thee in the name of
the Father, of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.

XI. The Latin tongue in Baptism, and the superstitious consecration, or
exorcisme of the water; are repugnant to the form of Baptism.

XII. The internal form consists in the analogy of aspersion, and remission
of sins; as also of regeneration or sanctification.

In this, Baptism answers the legal aspersions, by which likewise remission of
sin by the blood of Christ was shaddowed: Water also, as it cleanses from
filthiness, and moistneth the Plants, does adumbrate regeneration, whereby we
dye to sin, and live to righteousness: See Romans 6. v. 1. etc.

XIII. The end of Baptism; besides those which are common to it, and the Lords
Supper, is the sealing of our regeneration, and of our reception, or ingrafting
into the family of God.

XIV. The subject of Baptism; are all that be in the Covenant; even the
children of those who are reckoned among the number of the Covenanters.

This rule is grounded, 1. on Christ's command, Matt. 19.14. Suffer little
children, and forbid them not to come to me; they ought not then to be kept off
from Baptism, whom Christ will have to be brought to him. The words used in
this place, and Luke 18.15. Of little children and infants, are emphaticall. 2.
On the reason alleged by Christ, Mat. 19.14. For of such is the kingdom of
heaven; For if to them the kingdom of heaven, and the Covenant of Grace
belong, the seal of the Covenant must needs appertain to them also; but they
are capable of this Covenant, Genesis 17.7. I will be thy God, and of thy seed.
Act. 2 v. 39. To you and to your children is the promise made. 3 On the analogy
of circumcision; for with this Sacrament Infants were initiated. 4. On the
example of the Apostles who are sa^d to baptize whole families, Act. 16.15, 33.
It were a foolish thing to apply that rule, 2 Thessalonians* 3.10. [ If any will not
work, let him not ea^] to Infants: so perversely do the Anabaptists wrest the
places of Scripture to a contrary meaning; in which those that are of years,
are commanded to be taught, before they are baptized.

XV. Infants have both Faith and Reas^n: although not in the fruit, yet in the
seed and root; though not in the second act, yet in the first; though not by an
outward demonstration of the work; yet by the inward virtue of the holy Spirit.

XVI But concerning the Infants of Infidels, the case is otherwise; who are not
born of Parents, even so much as either of them a Believer: for they are not to
be baptized till they be of discretion, and are able to testify their Faith.

XVII. The Baptism of Bells, is a horrible profanation of the Sacrament, and
joined with abominable idolatry.

XVIII. As naturally we are born, before we eat; so baptism is before the
Lords Supper.

XIX. Baptism is not to be iterated, if the essentials thereof were used.

Hence it is, that our Church ratifies the Baptism of the Popish Church; not
as it is abused there, but as it is administered in the name of the Holy Trinity.

XX. Baptism is necessary, not absolutely, but in respect of ^hrists command;
neither must we feign such a necessity, as permits any other besides the
minister to baptize; or, to cause us think they are excluded out of heaven, if
they die unbaptised.

XXI. The Baptism of Christ, and of John are in effect the same.

The Pontificians deny that John's baptism was instituted by God; against
these plain testimonies; Mat 21.25. Luke 3.2. and 7.30. Joh. 1.33. Neither
matters it that John distinguishes between his baptism and Christ's, Mar. 1.8
For there the opp^sition is not between baptism and baptism, but a comparison
only between the office of the Minister in Baptism, and Christ; for the
Minister gives the Symbol but Christ the thing signified. They say that such
as were baptized by John, were rebaptised, Act. 19.1. etc. If they were
rebaptised by the Apostle, we gather that they were not rightly baptized by
some, who were imitators of John. neither yet can we find out of the text, that
they were rebaptised: for those words, v. 5. are not Lukes concerning Paul, but
Pau^'s concerning John and his disciples: therefore th^s place favors
neither Papist nor Anabaptists.

CHAP. XXIV. Of the Lords Supper.
THe Lords Supper is the other Sament of the New Testament; in which Christians
that are of age, receive spiritually Christ's body and blood sealed to them in
the reception of Bread and Wine according to Christ's institution.

The RULES.
I. The Lords Supper is called metonymically the Eucharist, or Thanksgiving,
Sin^xis, or a collection; the Lords Table, the New Testament, and
Synecdochically, the Breaking of Bread.

II. It has the same efficient causes that Baptism has.

III. The outward matter thereof, or Signs, are Bread and Wine.

IV The Supper is lame, without both Sgnes; and to rob the people of the Cup,
is Sacrilege.

Matthew 26, 27. Drink ye all of this. 1 Cor. 10.16. The cup of blessing which we
bless, is it not the Communion of Christ's blood? And 11. v. 26. As ^ften as
you shall eat this bread, and ^rink of this Cup, you declare the Lords death.

V. The inward matter is Christ, with all his satisfaction and merit.

VI. As it is Jewish Superstition, to use unleavened Bread; so the Popish Penny
Wafers are superstitious relics.

VII. Its outward form consists in Actions and Words.

VIII. The Actions are the breaking of Bread, and pouring out of Wine; the
distribution of both signs, and the receiving thereof with the hand and mouth.

IX. The word is, the whole institution, containing the Eucharist, the command,
and the promise; but the promise chiefly.

X. Therefore it is impiety to think that the bread is turned into Christ's body
only, the bare accidents remaining; by the low mumbling of these five words,
For this is my body, and that with one breath, and the Priests intention.

XI. The internal form consists in the Analogy of the sign, and the thing
signified: in which, by Bread and Wine are signified Christ's body and blood, as
spiritual meat and drink; but by the breaking of Bread, and pouring out of the
Wine, are represented the breaking of his body or crucifixion, and shedding of
his blood; and lastly, by the distributing and receiving of both, the applying
of Christ's death.

XII. The breaking of Bread is not a thing indifferent.

For Christ made use of this himself and commanded it to be used; saying, do
this; which he himself explained, adding, This is my body which is broken for
you. From this the Supper, is so called, by this also the Churches union is
showed. 1 Cor. 10.17. We being many, are one bread and one body; for we are all
partakers of that one bread.

XIII. The words, This is my body, can neither be meant of transubstantiation,
nor of consubstantiation* but the meaning is, This (to wit the Bread) is the
Sacrament of my body.

The Papists interpret the words thus: That which is contained under the kind
of Bread, is my Body. The Lutherans thus: in, with under this is my Body. The
reason of our interpretation, is explained in the former Chapter. They say that
it is absurd to use tropical phrases which are obscure, in Christ's will and
Legacy, But, 1. This supposition of theirs is false, that tropical phrases are
obscure; for we use tropes oftentimes to illustrate. 2. It is false also that
tropes are not used in Wills and Testaments: for Jacobs Will shows the
contrary, Gen ^9. And Moses's, Deuteronomy. 33. David's, 2 Samuel 23. Tobias, 4.
Matathias, 1 Mac. 2.3 If there be no trope in the Lords Supper, then let them
show how the Cup can be called the New Testament in his blood, without a trope.
That saying of Austins (Advers. Adimant. Mani^. cap. 12.) is worthy here to be
set down. The Lord doubted not to say, this is my Body, when he gave the Sign
of his Body.

XIV. It is one thing to say, that Christ is present in the Bread; and another
to maintain his presence in the Supper: for Christ is present in his Deity and
Spirit; he is present also in his body and blood, by a Sacramental presence; 1.
Of the Symbol, not that he is present in the Bread, but that he is presented by
the bread as by a symbol. 2. Of Faith, whereby we apply Christ with his merits
to us. 3. Of Virtue and efficacy.

XV. The proper end of the Supper (not to speak of others) is, to seal our
spiritual nutrition or preservation to life eternal, by the merit of Christ's
death and obedience; whence depends the union of the faithful with Christ, and
with themselves

XVI. It is an intolerable abuse, to take this Sacrament to prove ones
innocence, in the courts of justice, to confirm men's covenants, to prosper our
purposes and actions andc.

XVII. The Lords Supper must be often times taken.

As often as you shall eat this bread, etc. 1 Cor. 11.26.

XVIII The Supper differs from Baptism, not only in external signs, but in its
proper end: because Baptism is the sign of, spiritual Regeneration; but the
Supper of nutrition also in the object or subject to which, for Baptism is
given to Infants, the Supper to those only who are of years, and have been
tried: they differ also in time, for Baptism is used but once, the Lords Supper
often times.

XIX. The Popish Mass is altogether repugnant to the Lords Supper.

1. The holy Supper is instituted by Christ, the Mass by the Pope: 2. the
Supper is a Sacrament instituted in memory of Christ's sacrifice which was once
offered, but the Mass among Papists is the sacrifice it self to be offered
every day: the Ancients indeed called the Lords Supper a sacrifice; yet not
expiatory for sins, but Eucharistical, and such as is joined with prayers, and
charitable works, which are acceptable sacrifices to God. 3. Christ did not
offer himself in the Supper, but on the Cross; but ^hey will have Christ to be
offered in their Mass. 4. Christ instituted his Supper for the living; but the
Mass is celebrated for the dead also 5. In the Holy Supper Christ's body was
already made by the virtue of the Holy Ghost, not of bread, but of the Virgins
blood: In the Mass Christ's body is made anew by the Priest, uttering his five
words; and that of bread. 6. In the holy Supper, there was and remained true
Bread and true Wine, and it obtained this name even after consecration: In the
Mass, if we will believe it, there remain only the outward species of the
Element, and the accidents* 7. In the Holy Supper, they all drank of the c^p as
Christ commanded: in the Mass, the Lay People are denied the cup. 8. In the
Supper, Bread was broken to represent Christ's body broken on the Cross: In the
private Mass the bigger Host is broken into three parts: the first is for the
triumphant Church; the second, for the Church in Purgatory; the third, for the
Church here on earth.

CHAP. XXV. Of the Nature of the visible Church.
HItherto of the outward communion of the Covenant of grace: Now follows the
external society of the visible Church, where by all that be called, are
accounted for members of the Church: For the Church is considered either in it
self, or in opposition to the false Church; the Church is considered in her
self in respect of her own nature, and outward administration.

The visible Church then, is a visible society of men called to the state of
grace by the Word and Sacraments

The RULES
I. The name of Church and Synagogue, is the same with the Hebrew Kahal and
Edah; but the society of Christians is m^re usually called the church.

II We must carefully here observe the distinction of the word, that we may
know of what Church we speak.

III. For whereas it is distinguished into the triumphant, and militant: that
belongs to the doctrine of the state of glory; this is for our present
consideration.

IV. The militant Church, is divided into the visible and invisible.

V. The invisible Church, is the company of the Elect only.

This is called invisible, not as if the men that belong to her were not
visible as they are m^n, but that they are not perceived as they are elect: for
the Lord knows only who are hi^, 2 Timothy 2.19.

VI. This belongs to the doctrine of special vocation; for by her proper
effects, to wit, faith, charity, and such like, the elect which are the
invisible Church are known.

VII. The visible Church is the company of all that are called in common, as
well Reprobates as Elect.

VIII This word Church visible, is ambiguous: for properly it is meant of the
universal Church, dispersed through the whole World; more strictly, of any
particular Church as of France, England, Holland, etc. but most strictly, of
the representative Church, or the company of Pastors and Elders.

IX. Her efficient cause in common, is the holy Trinity; in particular Christ.

X. The matter of the Church are they who are called in common, and received
into the Covenant of grace, and Infants that are born in the Church.

XI. Neither unbaptised Infants, nor Catechumeni nor excommunicate persons, are
to be excluded out of the number of the Churches members.

The two fo^mer so^ts of men belong to the Church by the righ^ of covenant,
though not of profession; but for the third kind, though they be cast out of
some particular Church, yet they are not simply ejected out of the catholic
though the Papists excommunicate them.

XII. The form of the Church consists in a double union* the first is of her
conjunction with Christ her Head* the other, of her members among themselves.

XIII. The first union is in this, that in the Church not only Christ as the
head, is eminent; but also as the head, he communicates his gifts and virtue to
the members,

Ephesians 1.22. etc; And he has appointed him over all things to his Church,
which is his body, and the fullfilling of him, who fills all in all* and cap.
5.23. For the man is the head of the woman, even as Christ is the head of his
Church: and gives salvation to his body etc. Col 1 18. And he is the head of
the Church, which is his body.

XIV. They make a monster of the Church, who set up any other universal head
thereof besides Christ.

For as she is not headless, so is she not many headed, for of one body there
is but one head, except it be a monster: neither must therefore the Church,
because visible, have a visible head one earth: for properly the Elect only
are members of the Church; therefore though she be visible in respect of
outward administration, yet she is invisible in respect of the Elect, and of
their union with Christ.

XV. The other union of the members, or of particular Churches among
themselves, consists in the unity of profession, faith, and charity.

Ephesians* 4 4, 5 6. There is one body, and one spirit, even a^ you are called
into one hope of your vocation: there is one Lord, one Faith* one Baptism, one
God and Father of all, etc.

XVI. The principal end of the Church is Gods glory; the proximate, our
salvation.

XVII. Of the adjuncts we must observe her Titles and Notes.

XVIII. For her titles, she is called One Catholic, and Holy.

XIX. Christ's Church is one; in respect of the form now explained.

XX. She is Catholic; in respect of the union of time: place and persons

The Church Catholic has a treble signification* 1. A very general one* to
wit of the whole society of men and Angels 2. A more particular of the company
of all elect men. 3. Most special of all, of the visible militant Church.

XXI* She is Catholic in respect of time, because she has not utterly failed
since the beginning of the world; but still there has been some visible Church.

As the light of the Moon decreaseth, though her substance never wastes: even
so although the light of the Church is sometimes clearer, sometimes obscurer;
yet she remains the same still and visible too; not to Hogs eyes, but to the
godly.

XXII. In respect of place and persons, she is Catholic; because she is not
tied to place and persons*

Mat. 24.14, 15. This Gospel shall be preached through all the world. Acts
10.34, 35. Of a truth I perceive, that God is no accepter of persons; but in
every Nation, he that fears him and works righteousness is accepted with him

XXIII. The Church is holy in common, because of her calling and covenant; but
particularly in respect of the Elect, who are holy in Christ, by an imputed
righteousness begun in them.

Concerning the holiness of vocation, God says to Moses, Deuteronomy. 7.6. Thou art a
holy people to the Lord thy God. Of imputed and begun holiness, Paul, 1 Cor.
6.11. But you are washed, but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus,
by the Spirit of our God.

XXIV. The inherent holiness of the Church in this life is imperfect, except
in respect of Christ, who by his perfection covers her imperfection; and in the
hope of future perfection.

Ephesians. 5.25, 26, 27. Christ has loved his Church, and has given himself for
her; that he might sanct^fy and cleanse her with the washing of water by the
word; that he might present her to himself a glorious Church not having spot or
wrinckle or any such thing; but that she might be holy, and without blemish.

XXV. Therefore the Church is not free from all error; as the Papists say; for
although the Catholic Church does not so err in the fundamentals of Faith, as
to fall off utterly, yet she is not quite exempted from error, seeing there is
no member of her perfect in th^s life: as for a particular Church, she may both
err and become a harlot.

Hence the Church of Rome, which in the Apostles time was like the woman
clothed with the Sun, having a Crown on her head, and the Moon under her feet
is so degenerated, that she is likened to the whore sitting upon the Beast,
Rev. 12.1, and 17.3, etc.

XXVI. The notes of the visible Church are the pure Preaching of the word, and
lawful administration of the Sacraments.

We spoke above of the Notes of the invisible Church, that they depend from the
works of Vocation: for the notes of the Elect specially called, andi of the
visible Church are the same. But here these notes are only considered, by
which the Church is undubtedly made visible: now it appears that these are the
note, of the Church out of these testimonies. Matthew 28 19, 20. Go and teach all
Nations, baptzing them in the Name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy
Ghost; teaching them to observe all things which I have commanded you. Act.
2.24. And they continued steadfastly in the Apostles doctrine and fellowship,
and in breaking of bread, and in prayers, Some adjoyn Ecclesiastical
discipline; but this is contained under the two former; for this discipline is
required of both.

XXVII. These notes belong to all Churches alike, so far as concerns the
fundamentals of Religion: but in respect of accidentals, they are in some
Churches more, in some less.

XXVIII. Therefore we are not presently to doubt of the truth of any particular
Church, because of every error or abuse,

For there is so much purity expected, as not to err in any one article, or in
the administration of the Sacraments; so that there be not a falling off from
the hinge of salvation, to wit, from the two Tables of the Law, and Faith in
Christ* 1 Cor. 3.11, 12 For no man can lay any other foundation besides that is
laid, which is Jesus Christ: Now if any build upon this foundation, gold,
silver precious stones, wood, hay, stubble every man's work shall be made
manifest, for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire,
and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is; if any man's work
abide which he has built thereupon, he shall receive a reward; if any man's
work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss; but he himself shall be saved, yet
so as by fire.

XXIX. Of the fifteen Notes of the Church rehearsed by Bellarmine, some are
true, and agree with ours, from which not withstanding the Church of Rome is
afar off, but others are either strangers to the visible Church or they are the
Notes rather of the false, than of the true Church; or they are not convertible
with the Church, for they neither belong to her alone, nor always.

1. His first Note is the name Church and Christians: But the imposing of names
is a matter rather of fact than of right, therefore, an argument taken from the
name is of no force, without the thing answer to the name, Rev. 3.1. Thou art
said to live but thou art dead. 2. Antiquity: but this belongs not to the
Church alone, nor always. Not alone, because the world, the Heaven the
Elements, have antiquity, yet are not the Church. Not always because the Church
has not been always ancient, there was a time when she was new, true
antiquity is the first principle of things, which as it is first so it is most
true; therefore, in general, the Churches antiquity is to be reckoned from
Paradise; in particular, the Apostolical Church, from the preaching of Christ
and his Apostles. But the Church of Rome as it is at this day, arose long after
the Apostles times* 3. A constant duration without interruption. This indeed is
the property of the visible Catholic Church, but depending on Gods promises,
it does more appear to Faith than to sense; and as that is not true antiquity
which depends not from the first principle, so there can be no duration which
has not its original from the same. 4. Amplitude and multitude of Believers,
this belongs not always to the Church, as we may see in that Church that was
in the time of our first Parents, Noah, Abraham, etc. Yea, this note is not
natural to the Church; for there is still the greater number amongst the
wicked, Mat. 7.13. En^er in at the narrow gate. and Luke 12 32 Fear not little
flock. 5 The successions of Bishops: But this also neither is the Churches Note
alone, nor always. Not always; for as it was not in the beginning of the
Church; so it will cease toward the end: not alone; for in the false Church
there is found a succession of Bishops; whence we must look rather on the
succession of Doctrine than of persons; and the persons are to be judged by
their Doctrine, not this by the persons; They have not Peter 's inheritance,
who have not Peter 's Faith, says Ambrose. 6. An agreement in Doctrine with
the ancient Church; This indeed is a true Note, but it is the same with ours;
to wit the purity of the Word and Sacraments, as it was in the time of the
Apostolical Church, from which the Roman has fallen. 7. The union of the
members with their head (the Pope) and among themselves. The first limb of this
Note belongs to the false and Apostatical, not to the Apostolical Church: that
Church is she that worships the Beast, Rev. 13.12. The latter cannot be
attributed to the Church alone; for there is union also among Devils, Mat.
12.8. The 8. is holiness of Doctrine, which is the same with the sixth. The
ninth is efficacy of Doctrine, this also answers the sixth, and our Notes too;
but it agrees no ways to the Roman Church. 10. Holiness of life in the first
Authors and Planters of Religion. Now this Holiness is either inward or
outward; if inward, it is not a mark of the visible Church. He is a true Jew
that is so in secret, Romans 2.29. God knows who are his, 2 Timothy 2.19. If
outward, it is false; for Satan can transform himself into an Angel of light,
2 Cor. 11.14. Therefore the Church is to be judged by her Doctrine, not by the
life of her Doctors, Mat. 23.3. Whatsoever they hid you observe that observe
and do, but do you not after their works. 11. The glory of Miracles. 12. The
light of Prophesy. But the gifts of Miracles and Prophesy were extraordinary,
given to confi^m the Gospel, which are now vanished since the Gospel has been
propagated; wherefore the Apostles makes no promises of other miracles and
prophesy, But they rather make this ^ragging of miracles and prophesy a ^o^e of
the Antichrist on Church, 2 These. 2* 9 Rev. 13 13. And Christ himself says,
that He will not know such, Mat. 7.12. 13. The thirteenth No^e, is the
confession of adversaries, as Heathens, Jews, etc. But the authority of such
testimonies is as great as the adversaries themselves are, by whose accession
nothing is added, and by their want nothing is diminished* 14. The fourteenth,
is the unhappy and of those who have opposed the Church. 15. The fifteenth, is
the happiness of them who have defended her: But this Note is so uncertain,
that it deserves not the name of a Note, For ^f such, man knows not either
love or hatred, Ec. 9.3. Yea, it is rather a Note of the false Church; for it
is certain, that for the most part the Churches condition in this life is
wretched and sad, Joh. 16 20. Verily, verily, I say unto you, ye shall weep and
lament, but the world shall rejoice.

CHAP. XXVI. of the outward Administration of the Church.
HItherto of the nature of the Church; now follows its Administration, which is
either ordinary: or extraordinary: the ordinary is public or private; the
pblike is ecclesiastical, or poblitique; the eccelesiastical is that which
handles spiritual things: This is either proper to public persons in the
Church, or common to the whole Congregation.

The proper, is that which is executed by any Minister of the church according
to his calling. The Ministers are they to whom God has committed the charge of
his flock.

The RULES.
I. No man can have the charge of a Church, but he that is lawfully called.

II. No man is to be forced to undertake the Ministry.

III. Ministers are not to be debarred from Marriage.

1. Cor. 9.5. Have not we power to lead^ about a Sister, a wife as well as the
rest of the Apostles and brethren of the Lord and C^phas? 1 Timothy 3.2. A Bishop
must be without repro^f, the Husband of one wife; and v. ^ One that rules well
his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity.

Ministers are either ordinary, or extraordinary: They were extraordinary whom
God raised upon extraordinary occasions, either to establish a New government
in the Church, or else to repair the old government when it was decayed.

Such were the Prophets in the Old Testament: But in the New, John Baptist,
Christ, the Apostles, Prophets, that is, such as were furnished with gifts of
interpreting Scripture; Evangelists, that were the companions of the Apostles
and supplied their rooms in their absence; Pastors to rule and teach the
Church, and Doctors for the Schools, Ephesians. 4.11.

The RULES.
I. The marks of extraordinary Ministers, were extraordinary gifts.

II. Such were the gifts of Prophecy, Tongues, and Miracles.

III. These extraordinary gifts continued so long as it pleased God, and the
Churches necessity required them; which being taken away, the ordinary Ministry
succeeded.

Ordinary Ministers are they who be furnished with ordinary gifts, and ^n
ordinary calling. And these are Pastors and Doctors, Presbyters and Deacons.
The Pastors are they who are set over a particular flock, to teach them, to
administer the Sacrament to them, and to watch over them.

The RULES.
I. The name of Bishop belongs to all Pastors, 1 Timothy 3.1.

II. Although this custom prevailed in the Church, that he who had the charge
of the Diocese of particular Churches, was named Bishop, yet the name of
Universal Bishop belongs to none.

These are Doctors, who in the Schools teach youth the grounds of Truth, which
they may afterward profess in the Churches.

The RULE.
Pastors differ from Doctors, That in this they have the charge of the Church;
these of the Schools: They are to move the affections; these, to inform the
understanding of their auditors.

Presbyters are godly and grave men, joined to assist the Pastors in such
things as are fit for the good order of the Church in visiting of the sick, in
observing disordered livers, and such like.

Deacons and Diaconesses, of old, were they, who had the charge to gather and
distribute the Church goods.

Act. 6.1, etc, Tim. 3.8, etc.

The RULE.
I. The collection and distribution of Church goods is of Divine right.

This appears by the Oeconomie of the Old Testament; for by the command of God
Tithes were gathered for the Priests, Levites; and poor. In the new Testament,
Christ refused not the money that was offered by godly rich persons. Luke 8.3
out of which he sustained his Disciple^ and friends and the poor also, Ioh.
13.29. In the Apostles time the Deacons had charge of the Church goods, Act 6,
1. etc.

II. As we reprove the covetousness of the Romish Church, supported with
horrible superstition and idolatry in the gathering of Tithes and other Church
duties as likewise their profuse wasting thereof upon their pomp and luxury; so
among Protestants, they grievously offend God and the Church, who unfaithfully
dispense these goods.

Thus of the proper administration; the common consists in the calling of
Ministers, in the well ordering of the Church, in judging of Doctrine and
controversies, and in the use of the keys.

The calling of the Ministers, is the choosing of fit men for the church into
the Ministry, after trial had of their life and doctrine, and an introduction
of them by some solemn Rite into the Possession of their Office.

The RULES.
I. The chief efficient cause of this vocation is God who inwardly calls
Ministers, and furnishes them with his gifts: but the ministerial cause is the
whole Church, or at least the representative, consisting of Pastors and
Presbyters, or other Churchmen, and not the Bishop or Pastor alone.

For the Apostles never challenged to themselves alone the right of Election,
Act. 1.23. and 6.5. and 14.23.

II Three things are required to a lawful calling; trial, election, and
confirmation.

III. Trial is both of life and doctrine; and the life must be first tried
before doctrine: for he is not to be admitted to the trial of Doctrine, whose
conditions are not to be endured.

IV. The manner of Election is this: After the pouring out of fervent prayers
to God, the persons being named out of whose number one is to be chosen; either
by the vocal suffrages of all, or of the greatest part, or else by holding up
of hands, that one is elected.

V. Confirmation is the introduction of the party elected, in which public
prayers being premised, he is recommended to the Church and his calling is
confirmed by imposition of hands.

VI. Pontificians falsely say, that that is an unlawful calling, which is done
by the Presbyters without the Bishop.

For Bishops have not by Divine right, greater power and authority.

VII. The Reformed Church has ratified the calling of them, who in our fore
fathers time reformed the Church; not as if it proceeded from Popery as a bunch
or swelling of the Church, but as principally they were called by God, and
furnished with gifts.

They object, that such men were called under Popery, but that their vocation
is expired since they fell off: We answer that they are falsely accused of
falling off: for they have not fallen off from the Gospel, to the preaching of
which they were called even in Popery, but from the corruption of the Gospel:
neither have they cause to cry out that they were called to preach the doctrine
of the Romish Church; for whereas they comprehend their doctrine under the
title of the Gospel, the Minister, who observes, that in very truth it is far
from the Gospel, he by the right of his calling might contradict the same.
Although then they have revolted from the Romish Church, yet they have not
revolted from their calling.

VIII. Neither can they produce any thing whereby they may infringe the calling
of our Ministers, performed according to the former Rules above handled.

For 1. When they ask by what right we teach? we answer the same that Christ
did to those that asked the same question, Mat. 21.25. The Baptism of John
whence is it, from heaven or from men? Even so we say, the Doctrine of our
Ancestors, which is preached among us at this day, whence is it? Is it
repugnant to the word of Christ and his Apostles, or is it consonant? If it be
repugnant, let them show in what Articles: If it be consonant, they cannot
reprove our vocation For where the true Doctrine has place, there the vocation
is lawful: Besides, that calling which answers the example of the Apostles and
Primitive Church, is lawful; but that our calling is such, cannot be denied.

The power of judging Doctrines, is that whereby the Church enquires into men's
Doctrine, and cuts off the controversies that trouble her.

The RULES.
I. Every private man may and ought to judge of the Doctrine he professes,
whether it be consonant to Scripture or not.

Act 17 11. The men of Berea daily searched the Scripture, whether these things
were so. 1. Cor. 10.15. I speak as to those who understand, judge you what I
speak. 1 John 4.1. Beloved, believe not every Spirit, but try the Spirits if
they be of God.

II. This ought to be done also by the Presbytery or assembly, when any great
controversy arises.

III. As the holy Spirit is the chief Judge of controversies; so the Scripture,
which is the voice of the holy Spirit, is the rule by which the straight is
known from the crooked.

The power which concerns the well ordering of the Church, is that which
determines what things ought to be done decently in the Church.

The RULES.
I. The object of this power, are the outward circumstances of Divine Worship;
to wit, time, place, and such like, which in themselves be indifferent.

II. If in these any inconvenience is found, the Church may lawfully abrogate
the old Ceremonies, and substitute such as are more convenient.

III. Yet the canons and customs of the Church must not equal the
Scripture-canons.

The power of the Keys is that, which the Church uses for preservation of
Discipline: whereof are two parts; to bind, and to loose.

To bind, is to denounce Gods wrath against sinners, unless they repent.

To loose, is to pronounce remission of sins to repentant sinners* both which
have certain degrees: The degrees of binding are: 1 A severe exhortation and
commination, after private admonitions have been re^ected; this must be done by
the Presbytery Mat. 18.15, 16, 17. If thy brother should trespass against thee,
go tell him his fault between thee and him alone; if he shall hear thee, thou
have gained thy brother; but if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one
or two more, that in the mouth of one or two witnesses every word may be
established; and if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the Church; but
if he shall neglect to hear the Church, etc.
. 2. A keeping off from the Lords Supper Mat. 7.6. Give not that which is holy
unto dogs, nor cast your pearls before swine.
. 3. The greater excommunication, by which the sinner is cast out of the
Church, yet not without hope of pardon and return, if he repent 1 Cor. 5.5. Let
such a man he delivered over to Satan to the destruction of the flesh, that the
spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
. 4. Anathema, or in the Syriac word Maranatha, when he is cast out without
hope 1 Cor. 16.22. If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be
Anathema, Maranatha. 1 John 5.16. There is a sin unto death, I do not say he
shall pray for it.
.

In loosing, the same degrees being observed, the sinner is by the Church
received again into favor. So by the Apostles advice, the excommunicated
Corinthian is received again into grace, 2 Cor. 2.7, 8.

The RULES.
I. Christ is the author and founder of this power.

Out of the testimonies above cited.

II. This power of the Keys is in the whole Presbytery, not in the Bishop or
Pastor alone.

The Pope falsely arrogates this power to himself. For to say nothing of that
right which he claims from Peter, it is certain, that the Keys were not
delivered to Peter alone, Mat. 16.18. but the same right was imparted also to
all the rest. Mat. 18.18. Verily I say unto you, whatsoever you bind on earth,
etc. and Joh. 20.23. Whose sins ye shall remit, etc.

III. The object of this binding, is the sinner; who either was not amended by
private admonition, or whose scandal was greater than could be done away by
private exhortation.

IV. The form consists in the decent observation of degrees: For when the
first and second will prevail, we should not make use of the third, and very
seldom of the fourth.

V. Popish Indulgences, which are the fictitious treasure they brag of,
gathered by the Pope out of the merits of Christ, of the blessed Virgin, and of
the Saints, who suffered more (as they teach) than their sins deserved; are
far from the power of the Keys.

Let the treasure of Christ's blood suffice us, which cleanses us from all sin,
1 John 1.7.

VI. Loosing, consists not in those satisfactions which they enjoin s^nners.

By satisfaction here, we understand not that which is given to the Church by a
serious testimony of repentance, and that publicly, when it is required; but
that which satisfies for sin. Besides their opinion is grounded on a false
supposition, that the punishment is reserved, after the fault is remitted. Of
this we will speak in the Doctrine of Just^fication hereafter.

VII. The end of this power is the preservation of the Churches honor, and
that wicked men might be brought to repentance.

VIII. The power of the Church, and of the Magistrate, differ in these. 1 The
object of this is any man; but of that the members of the Church only, without
exception of the greatest personages. 2. The object of this, are the body and
outward goods; but of that, the soul. 3 This punishes even penitents; that
receives penitents into favor.

IX. Ministers and Presbyters should not divulge any secret offense, revealed
to them by him whose conscience is oppressed, except the safety and peace of
the Public require it, least others be debarred of the Churches comfort.

Thus of the Church Government: the Political follows, and is that whereby the
Church also is governed by the Magistrate.

The RULES
I. Magistrates are the Churches nursing, fathers, as they are keepers of the
two Tables of the Law, as they preserve Churchese and Schools, and defend the
Truth.

II. The Clergy is not exempted from the Magistrates subjection.

Romans 13.1. Let every soul be subject to the higher powers. The examples of
Christ paying toll-money, Mat. 17.27. of Paul appealing to Caesar, Acts 25, 11.
witness this.

III The Infidel-Magistrate must be obeyed in things that may be done with a
saf-conscience.

IV. We must pray for Magistrates that be Infidels, 1 Timothy 2.1 etc.

So much of the Public Admininistration: The Private is, whereby each member
of the Church is coupled with one another in the bond of love, to the edifying
of the whole mystical body.

See Romans 12.6, etc. 1 Cor. 12 12 etc. Ephesians. 2.20, etc. and 4.1, etc.

Hitherto of the Ordinary Church Government: The Extraordinary is, when
necessity requiring, a Council is gathered.

A Council is a Meeting enjoined by the Civil Magistrate, or the common consent
of the Church; in which men endowed with the gifts of the Spirit, and l^wfully
chosen for this purpose, undertake the Churches cause, and out of Gods word
define it. And this is either Ecumenical and universal, or else particular.
Particular is, National or Provincial.

The RULES.
I. A Council must be called by the Magistrate, if he be Faithful: If he be an
Infidel, either it is to be procured by Petition; or if he be an open Enemy to
the Council, it must be held by the Churches common consent, necessity so
requiring it

II. The Persons which should be present at the Council, are the Civil and
Ecclesiastical Presidents* so many Scribes, and fit men chosen for this
purpose. Neither are private men to be altogether excluded, who may be present
at the handling of Doctrinal points; but not in matters of Scandal, which
charity ought to cover.

III. The matter which is to be handled in the Council or Synod, is Church
business, which is of weight, and worthy of serious consideration.

IV. The form of the Council, consists in a religious and orderly
disquisition of the truth

V. It will be religious, if after fervent prayers to God, all things be tried
by Scripture, as by an infallible Line and Rule.

VI. It will be orderly, if every man be mindful of his duty.

VII. It is the part of the civil President to gather the Council; to protect
it being gathered; to prohibit all violence and disorder; by his authority to
publish the decrees lawfully made, and to curb the refractory.

VI. The ecclesiastike President, is to propose the Question; to moderate the
Disputation, by the advice of his Assistance; to ask their opinion; and by
Notaries to record the Decrees

IX. The rest of the Delegates are to propose their Opinion calmly, and
roundly; or to assent to him that spoke before, if his opinion was right

X: The presidencie that the Pope claims over councels, is far from this form,
who neither consulteth with Scripture, no^ asks the opinion of his
Assistants, but obtrudes his Dictates to be confirmed by the Council.

XI. The form of the Council of Jerusalem, was far otherwise, in which every
man might lawfully utter his opinion: Paul and Barnabas had as much freedom to
speak as Peter; and after their opinions had been canvassed too and fro, James
at length concludes. Acts 15. v. 6.19.

XII. The end of Councels, is peace and truth in the Church.

XIII. As far as Councels agree with Scripture, so great is their authority;
neither are they more exempted from erring, than the Church her self.

What credit we are to give to Popish Councels, may be seen both by the
opposition of Councels to one another, as likewise by their impious Decrees.
The Councels of Constance and ^asil subjected the Pope to the Synod: but that
of Trent on the contrary extols the Pope above all Councels. The second Council
of Nice imp^ously thrusts out the second Commandment; and that of Constance
sacrilegiously robs the people of the Cup in the Lords Supper.

CHAP. XXVII. Of the False Church.
THus in two Chapters we have considered the Church in her self: Now of the
False Church, which is opposite to her, and her Enemy.

The Churches Enemies are either open, or secret.

These are called, in Rev. 20.8. Gog and Magog; that is covered and uncovered.

Her open foes are Heathens, Jews, and Mahumetans. The Heathens are they, who
feign, paint, and worship false and fictitious Gods.

The Jews deny the Trinity, and the coming of the Messiah, and interpret
carnally, what is spoken of Christ's Kingdom in the Prophets spiritually.

The Mahumetans prefer their Mahomet to Christ, and their Alcoran to the
Scriptures; which Alcoran that Impostor compiled by the help of a Nestorian
Monk and an Arrian, out of the sink of Gentilisme, Judaisme, Manicheisme,
Arrianisme, and other heresies.

The hid or counterfeit Enemies, are either false Christ's, or Antichrists:
False Christ's are they, who brag themselves to be Christ.

As Simon Magus, Barcochab, Moses Cretensis, David Georgius, and such like.

Antichrists are, commonly, all Heretics; but particularly, and by way of
excellency, that great Antichrist.

1 John 2.18. Little Children, now is the last time; and as ye have heard that
Antichrist would come, even now many Antichrists are begun. and 1. Epist. c. 4.
v. 3. Whatsoever spirit does not confess that Jesus Christ is come in the
flesh, he is not of God* but this is that spirit of Antichrist, of whom you
have heard, that he was to come, and that he is now in the World.

Heretics are they, who maintain stubbornly against the plain light of truth,
any doctrine which overthrows directly, or by necessary consequence the
fundamentals of Christian faith.

The RULES.
I. Not every Error makes an Heretic.

For either there is an error against the foundation; as that of the Arrians
and Marcionites, of whom, they denied the divinity of Christ, these his
humanity: Or about the foundation; so the Papists err, while they teach
Transubstantiation, which overthrows the truth of Christ's humanity: Or besides
the foundation; such errors are by Paul compared to hay, wood, etc. 1. Cor.
3.12.

II. An Heretic is made, 1. by an error in, or about the foundation, 2. by
conviction, 3. by contumacie.

III. Not every Schismatic is an Heretic.

He is a Schismatic, who without hurting the foundation of Faith, departs from
some Ceremony of the Church, proudly and out of ambition.

The great Antichrist, is he, who under the name of Christ's Vicar, persecutes
him,

The RULES.
I. The name Antichrist belongs not to one person alone, but to a whole state
or order of men, as it were in the same Kingdom succeeding each other.

Even as the word of High Priest. He is not then opposite to Christ, as one
person is to another, in respect of substance; but he is opposite to him in
respect of quality o^ office.

I^. The Papists will have Antichrist to be one particular man; a Jew of the
Tribe of Dan, the Jews Messiah, and the restorer of their Religion, who shall
reign at Jerusalem three years and a half, shall fight with Henoch and Eliah,
shall offer to ascend to heaven from Mount Olivet, but shall be destroyed by
Christ.

III. But we out of Scripture describe Antichrist thus. 1. That he is a man at
one time, one; but in succession of time, an order of men; in the same state
succeeding each other. 2. Raised by Satan. 3. A Christian in name only. 4. In
very deed Christ's Enemy. 5. Sitting in the Temple of God as God. 6. Reigning
in that great City, which rules over the Kings of the Earth. 7. Seducing the
inhabitants of the Earth with lying wonders. 8. Setting a mark on his
followers. 9. Full of idolatry, ambition, avarice, cruelty and impurity 10.
Revealed in the last times. 11. He shall be destroyed by the breath of Christ's
mouth, and shall be overthrown by his own lovers, and utterly abolished at
Christ's glorious coming.

If these things be proved, the description of the Pontificians will vanish in
smoke. 1. He is not one particular person, but an order succeeding each other:
as appears by the appointed time of Antichrist, which extends it self even from
the time of Paul and John when this mystery began to appear, 2 These. 2.7. 1
Ioh. 4.3. even ^ill the coming of Christ, 2 These. 2.8. whence that fiction of
three years and a half fails. 2. He is raised by Satan, 2 These. 2 9. his
coming shall be with the power of Satan, Rev. 13.4. The Dragon gave him power*
Whereas otherwise Magistrates are raised by God, Romans 13* 2.3, etc. Thirdly, A
Christian in name only. 2 These. 2.4. He sits in the Temple of God. Fourthly,
Christ's Enemy. 1 John 4.3. He denies Christ to have come in the flesh to wit,
by the sequel of his Doctrine. Rev. 13.11. He has horns like a Lamb,
arrogating that to himself which belongs to Christ. Rev. 17.14. He fights
against the Lamb, and 19.19. and 20.8. Fifthly, He sits in the Temple of God. 2
These. 2.4. Not in that of Jerusalem, which is abolished without hope of
resurrection Dan 9.26, 27. But in the Church which is Gods Temple, 2^. cor, 6
16. He sits, that is, he reigns. Rev. 18.7. I sit a Queen. He sits as God, and
exalts himself above every thing that is called God, 2 These. 2.4. Sixthly, He
reigns in the great City, the type whereof is, The beast with seven heads and
ten horns, sitting upon many waters. Where the seven heads are seven hills,
and seven Kings, or forms of Government, by a Metonymie; Ten horns signify ten
Kings, and the waters many People and Nations, Rev. 17.1. etc. Seventhly,
Wonders are preached. 2 These. 2.9. Lying wonders, Rev. 13.13, 14. He works
great wonders, so that he makes fire to come down from Heaven upon the Earth
in the sight of men, and he seduceth the Inhabitants of the Earth, etc. and v.
15. And he had power to give life to the image of the beast and that (...)
should speak, etc. Eighthly, And he caused every one great and small to receive
his mark on their right hands or foreheads; and that none might buy or sell,
but such as had his mark or name, or number of his name, etc. and his number
was six hundred sixty six, Rev. 13.16, 17, etc. Ninethly, Idolatry by a
familiar Scripture phrase is shadowed out by a Whore, Rev. 17.1. His ambition
appears by that place in the Thessalonians. His covetousness is noted by his
gainful merchandising, Rev. 18.11. His cruelty is set out by the Beast drunk
with the blood of the Martyrs, Rev. 17.6. His impurity, by sins heaped up to
Heaven, Rev. 18.5. Yea these in general, by the mystical name of Sodom, Egypt,
Babylon, and Jerusalem are described, in which mystical Christ, that is, Christ
in his members, is crucified, Rev. 11.8. and 14.8. Tenthly, He is to be
revealed in the last times; He that lets must be taken out of the Way, 2
These. 2.7, 8. That is, the Roman Emperor; for so long as he lived in Rome, he
hindered the revealing^ of the Antichrist. Eleventhly there be two degrees of
destroying: 1. He shall be slain by the breath of Christ's mouth, 2 These. 2.8.
that is, with the sword of his word, which proceeds out of his mouth, Rev.
19.12 the effect whereof shall be this, that as soon as Antichrists fraud shall
be found out; the lovers of the whore, shall hate her, and shall make her
desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh and with fire burn her, Rev.
17.16.2. He shall be abolished by the glorious coming of Christ, 2. These. 2.8.
When he shall be cast into that Lake of fire which burns with brimstone, Rev.
19.20.

IV. This description shows not only what, but who this great Antichrist is,
for that must needs be the thing defined, to which the definition belongs:
but the definition belongs to the Pope, therefore he is the thing defined.

The Minor is proved by an induction or application of each member. 1. The
first member is out of question; for every one knows that the Popes succeed
each other. 2. The second member is manifest both by its effects, as also by
their example, who have attaind that Seat by wicked arts and ways, as
Alexander the sixth, Sylvester the second, Benedict the ninth, of whom see
Platina and other Popish Writers. 3 By profession, the Pope will not deny
himself to be a Christian. 4. That he is Christ's Enemy, and that he has made
horns to himself like those of the Lamb, is apparent; because he claims to
himself Christ's prophetical, Sacerdotal and Regal offices: together with the
titles of High Priest, Prince of Pastors, Head and Husband of the Church etc.
while he casts by Christ's word as needless and obscure, like a nose of wax,
equalling, yea, preferring his traditions to it: He overthrows Christ's
Prophetical office, whilst he urges the merits and intercession of Mary and of
the Saints: He destroys Christ's Preisthood, and his kingly office, whist he
takes upon him to do what he pleases in the Church. But if you compare Christ's
life with the Popes, the humility of the one with the pride of the other, the
doctrine of the one with the doctrine of the other, concerning Free will,
justification, the Sacraments, and such like articles, it will appear that fire
and water are not more contrary. 5. That he sits in the Temple of God, that is,
in the Church which is his Temple, as is said, is manifest. Now the Roman
Church, as it is Popish, is not called the Temple of God. But 1. As in John's
time it was the true Church of Christ; and so the Temple of Jerusalem of old,
was called the Temple of God, though it had been converted to a den of thieves,
Ier 7. ver. 11. 2. As God has there yet those that belong to election. The
Pope is born in the Church, he sits in her, not as her true and natural Son,
but as a Monster, a bunch or swelling, or as a canker cleaving fast to the
body. Furthermore, that he sits there as God, the titles which his Flat^^^ers
give him, make ^t plain: they deny him to be a man; therefore they call him
Admirable, which is Christ's title, Esa. 9.6. etc. (Gloss^ de. Elect. c. fund)
Also their Lord God, de concess. praeb. c. proposuisti. In the Council of
La^eran, the acclamation which they gave to Pope Le^ the tenth was, To thee is
given all power in Heaven and Earth* But he extols himself above God, not only
in preferring himself before Magistrates, which are called gods, especially
before the Emperor whom he calls the Moon, and himself the Sun, but alse by
preferring his Decrees to Gods Word, and consequently himself to God. 6. He
possesses that City, which has seven Hills, and had seven Kings. That Rome
has seven Hills all the World know, but the seven Kings, metonymically, are
the seven forms of Government which were in Rome before Popery: for there
were, 1. Kings. 2* Consuls, 3. Dictators, 4. Tribunes of the People, 5. the
December viti, 6. Tribunes of the Soldiers, 7. Emperors. Of whom the Angel says,
Rev. 17.10. Five are now fallen, to wit, the Kingdom, the Dictatorship, the
Tribuneship of the people, the Decemvirat, and Tribuneship of the Soldiers.
One, says he, is, to wit* the Emperor with the Consuls, which remained under
the Empire: therefore he says, five, not six, are fall^n: and another was not
yet come, ibid. v. 10. to wit, the Pope; and he is one of the seven; and is the
eight: Ibid v. 11. the eighth, in respect of the seven that went before; of the
seven, because the power, tyranny, idolatry, etc. of all the seven governments
or kingdoms have met together in Popery, as it were in a sink. He was, says
the Angel to John, v. 8 he is not, and yet he is; he was the Beast, or Rome; to
wit, the Seat of seven Kings: he is not, the seat of Antichrist, not as yet
revealed: And yet he is; to wit, the seat of the Emperor, reigning in John's
time. These do agree so fitly with Rome, that some Jesuits are forced to
confess that Rome, is that Beast. 7. As for Miracles; there is no thing more
usual in Popery than to brag of miracles; but what are they? they are lying
wonders: He makes fire to come down from Heaven, that is, by the thunder of
excommunication, he brings the fire of Gods wrath from Heaven; in token
whereof, when he goes about to excommunicate Kings and Princes, he flings down
from the Capitol burning torches: but if you look upon the literal
interpretation, Hildebrand was wont to shake sparkles of fire out of his
sleeves; And they record in their Legends, that at the requests of holy men,
fire has been brought down from Heaven. But he gives life also to the image of
the Beast. By the name of image, idolatry is understood, by introducing of
which, the Gentile idolatry, as it were raised again out of the grave, was
restored and quickened: but in a litteral sense this is true; for it is known
how Papists have caused their images laugh, weep, speak, etc. We read in the
Legend of Thomas, that when he had presented to Christ's image the third part of
his Theology, He asked if he had written well or not? The image answered;
Thomas, thou have written well of me. 8. He puts a mark upon his followers, in
which apishly he imitates Christ, who signs his servants on the forehead, Rev.
17.5. etc. Besides the mark, the name L -- 30 and number of a -- 1 the Beast
are T -- 300 the same; to e -- 5 wit, the name i -- 10 containing the N -- 50
number 666. th -- 70 That name in z -- 200 Irenaeus, the 666 scholar of
Polycarpus, who was Saint John's disciple, is (...), the letters of which do
exactly make up 666 the name is very fit: for he reigns in Italy, where
heretofore was the kingdom of the Latins; he prefers the Latin Bible to the
Originals; his Ministers perform their Div^ne Service in Latin; and in Latin
they write all their Bulls, etc. He sets a mark generally on their foreheads
and right hands, in that they are forced by open profession (the symbol whereof
is the forehead) and by their actions (which are figured out by the righ^
hand) to witness that they belong to the R^man and Latin Church. But
particularly he sets a mark upon his followers, when in Baptism he signs them
with the Cross, and in Confirmation, when he puts Chrisme on their foreheads;
and when in Ordination of Ministers he anoints their head and fingers. 9.
Concerning their idolatry and wickedness, read the History of the Popes; for to
rehearse more, is not now our purpose. 10. He was revealed about the year 600.
For after that Constantine the Emperor translated his seat to Byzantium,
Sylvester took possession of the Palace; since which time the insolency of the
Popes did so increase, that abo^t the year 595. a most bitter contention arose
between Gregory the Great and John of Constantinople, concerning the
Supremacy. At length Boniface the 3* obtained of the Emperor Phocas, a
Parricide and Tyrant, that the Romish Church might be the head of all the rest,
and that he should be styled Universal Bishop. 11. As for his destruction; the
event now shows how much his power is impaired by the preaching of the Word,
and how many Kings have fallen off from him. Other passages we must expect with
patience.

V. The King of the Locusts, the swarms of which were raised out of the
bottomless pit, is a figure of Antichrist, and of his Clergy, Monks, etc Rev.
9. v. ^, 3, 11.

VI. The two Beasts, Rev. 13 are figures ^f one and the same Antichrist. The
first with seven heads ascending out of the Sea, etc. very fierce; paints him
out as he is in very truth. The latter like a Lamb, does shadow him as he seems
to be by his impostures.

VII. The Dragon, Beast, and False Prophet (for the same is signified by these
names) sending out three impure Spirits like Frogs, called the Spirits of
Devils, showing signs, and stirring up the whole world to battle, Rev. 16.13,
14. The event does so clearly show us of what this was the figure, that he who
sees it not is blind.

VIII. The Beast, c. 17 v. ^, etc. notes out the Seat of Antichrist; but the
Whore that sits on the Beast, the Church of Antichrist.

I have somewhat largely handled these things, because its needful not only
to know Christ, but Antichrist also: and these passages conduce not a little
for the understanding of the Apocalypse.

CHAP. XXVIII. Of Vocation in special.
SO much of Vocation, as it is common to Elect and Reprobates: now the Special
follows; which belongs only to the elect. And it is that vocation whereby God
calls the Elect, as yet in themselves miserable and corrupted; outwardly, by
the Word of the Gospel; but inwardly, by illuminating the mind and changing
the heart, to be partakers of the grace of Salvation.

The RULES.
I. In Scripture, this is called A new Creation Ezech. 36.26. I will give you a
new heart, and I will put a new spirit in the midst of you: and I will take
away the heart of stone and will put in you a heart of flesh, 2 Cor. 4.6. God
who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, has shined in our hearts, to
give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Jesus
Christ.
, Regeneration Joh. 3.3. If a man be not born again, he cannot see the Kingdom
of God,
, a Drawing Joh. 6.44. None can come to me except the Father draw him,
, Divine Teaching Joh. 6.45. It is written in the Prophets, they shall be all
taught of God; whosoever the^fore ha^h heard of the Father, and has learned,
comes unto me,
, and Resurrection ^oh 5.25 Verily, verily I say unto you, the time comes, and
now is* when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that
hear it shall live.
.

II. In the Schools it is called Actual Election, Effectual Calling, and
Internal Calling.

It may be called Actual Election, because by this God puts in execution the
decree of Election. For whom he predestined, them he called, Romans 8.30. So
Joh. 15.19. I have chosen you out of the world. It is called Effectual Calling,
in respect of the calling of reprobates, which by their own fault is made
ineffectual to salvation. It is called also Internal* because the calling of
reprobates is either outward only by the word; or if they be any way inwardly
illuminated or moved, it is but a temporary change.

III. The principal efficient cause of vocation, is God; the impulsive, is his
free mercy; the instrumental, the Ministry of the Word.

2 Timothy 1.9 W^o has saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not
according to our works; but according to his own purpose and grace, which was
given us in Christ Jesus before the world began, 2 These. 2.14: who has called
you by our Gospel, etc.

IV The matter or object of vocation, is man elected, but in himself as yet
miserable, natural, carnal, sinful, estranged from the life of God, yea, dead
in sin.

Ephesians. 2.1. And you together has he quickened, when you were dead in sins and
trespasses. Col. 2.13. And you that were dead in your sins has he quickened.
Tit. 3.3. For we our selves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived,
serving diverse lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful and
hating one another.

V. Therefore the Semipelagians err, when they give to man a preparation, or a
propension to hearken to his vocation.

The reason is plain by what we have said; for how can a dead man raise
himself? No more can man further his own vocation.

VI. Yet man is not like a stock, when he is called: for he is the fit subject
of vocation; seeing he is not a Lion, nor a Dog, but a rational creature; yet
his reason helps him nothing to his vocation, till it be enlightened.

VII. It Is absurd to extend this grace of vocation to all men: whereas common
vocation (of which already) happens not to all men, as the whole story of the
Old Testament teaches; For not the Gentiles but Jews were called.

VIII. The form consists in the gracious change of man's mind and heart,
whereby not only is the mind illuminated, but our stony hearts also are made
fleshy, and framed to obedience.

This appears sufficiently out of what is said, especially out of Ezech. 36.

IX. Therefore the Arminian Novelists falsely teach, that the understanding is
endowed with knowledge, and that the affections are irresistibly excited; but
that its left in the freedom of the will to believe, or not to believe: That
the power to believe is given by irresistible grace, but not the act.

This error is plainly overthrown by that which God pronounces concerning the
change of the heart, Ezech. 36.26. So Christ witnesses, that not only the
Elect do hear and learn of God, but all that have been taught come to him, Ioh.
6.45.

X. The grace of Vocation is plainly irresistible, not if you look upon our
corrupted nature, which is harder than a stone; but in respect of the Holy
Ghost, by whom the Elect are so drawn, that they follow inevitably.

XI. This drawing is no ways violent, nor does it resist the natural liberty
of the will; which of its own nature being corrupted, and bent to evil only,
when the holy Spirit touches it, presently and freely it follows.

This drawing is like that of the Shepherd, when with a green Branch he draws
the sheep after him, which follows not violently, but spontaneously; although
this be not altogether alike; because the sheep is allured by its natural
inclination, but man by that propension which the Holy Ghost has put in him;
God indeed calls outwardly, but withal he illuminates the mind inwardly, that
man might know the excellency of his vocation; so God moves the heart, that it
might obey.

XII. The Novelists also falsely teach, that sufficient grace is given to all
men, but not the act it self of accepting and using that grace.

This opinion overthrows it self; for if the grace of believing is not given in
respect of the act, then grace is not sufficient, seeing no man is saved, but
he that believes: We confess indeed, that common vocation is sufficient to make
the reprobates excuseless, but not to save them; hence God speaks, Isa 5.4
What can I do more to my Vineyard, etc.

XIII. A. R. The Pelagians absurdly teach, that by grace is meant our natural
abilities. This is true if we take grace in that strict sense, as it is used in
Scripture for the grace of vocation, justification, or salvation by Christ;
which is no part, effect, or property of nature, but altogether different from
nature: for by nature we are the fons of wrath, says the Apostle, But by grace
we are saved, says the same Apostle; by grace I am what I am, says he; not I,
but the grace of God with me, 1 Cor. 15.10. without me says Christ, you can do
nothing. What have we which we have not received? Of our selves we cannot think
a good thought, says Saint Paul. Here nature and grace a^e distinct; yet in a
large extent; grace may be called natural, and nature may be called grace: The
first is plain, because whatsoever perfects nature, may be called natural; and
such is grace. 2. Whatsoever is in nature, as in its subject, is natural, but
so is grace; for nature is the subject of grace. 3. Whatsoever we bring into
the world with our nature, is called natural; Thus sin is natural, and
hereditary diseases are natural, because we bring them with us: So Adams
original justice is called natural; and so are all Angelical perfections,
because they were created with them: So the sannctification of those in
Scripture, who were sanctified from the womb, may be called natural. Again,
nature may he called grace: for whatsoever is not of due debt, is of grace;
such is nature, and all natural powers, and actions; for it is of grace, that
we live, move, and have our being in God; who is the prime and universal cause,
without Whose influence the second and subordinate causes cannot work: and
therefore, ^ven for the actions and faculties of nature, as eating, drinking,
sleep, life, health, etc. we are bound to give thanks, and to beg their
continuance and preservation; to which duty we are not tied, if these be of
debt, and not of grace. But saving grace is distinguished from nature, as the
garment from the body; the one may be lost without the other: And so when the
Fathers speak of Adam's original justice, they say, he lost his garment and was
stripped naked.
The Pelagians absurdly teach that by the grace of Vocation, we are to
understand our natural abilities.

For the Scripture never thus uses the word Grace: but means either that grace
which makes us acceptable, or that grace which is freely given. Ephesians. 1.6. To
the praise rf the glory of his grace, wherein he has made us accepted in the
beloved. Romans 12.6. Having diverse gifts, according to the grace which is given
to us.

XIV. The end of Vocation is Gods glory, and the salvation of the Elect.

XV. The time of calling is not tied to Baptism; for God cal's some before,
some in, and some after Baptism.

So Abraham before Circumcision* was called and justified, Romans 4.

XVI. Out of these we may see what is the difference between general and
special Vocations. That is oftentimes outward only: this is inward. That
works sometimes internally in Reprobates also; yet the light of salvation
which it affords in the mind is but weak, and the joy with which it affects the
heart is but momentary: but this irradiats the mind with a full light, and
seasoneth the heart, not with a bare relish, but with a true sense of
spiritual gifts, and fill sit with true and constant joy. That may be lost: but
the gifts and graces of this can never be lost.

Of general Vocation see Matthew. 13, 20. But he that receives the seed into
stony places, the same is he that hears the word, and anon with joy receives
it, yet has he no root in himself, but dureth for a while. Heb. 6. v. 4, 5.
etc. It is impossible for these who were once enlightened, and have tasted of
the Heavenly gifts, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, and have
tast-the good word of God and the powers of the world to come, if they shall
fall away to renew them again to repentance. But of special Vocation, Paul,
Rom* 11.29. For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.

CHAP. XXIX. Of Saving Faith.
THe effects of special vocation, are immediate or mediate: The immediate
effect is saving Faith, which is the gift of Vocation, whereby he that is
elected applies to himself the free Promises of Christ in the Gospel, and
rests in them.

The RULES.
I. This word Faith in Scripture has five significations: For either it is
taken metonymical^y for wholesome Doctrine, and this is the Faith which, not by
which we believe 1 Timothy 1.19. Holding faith and a good conscience, which some
having put away, concerning faith have made shipwreck.
, or for historical Faith Jam. 2.19. Thou believe there is one God, thou
do well; the Devils also believe and tremble. This faith then which
consists in a bare assent, i^ common to the Elect and Reprobate.
, or temporary Matthew. 13.20. He that reciveth the seed into stony places, the
same is he that hears the word, and ^^on with joy receives it; yet has he
not root etc.
, or for the Faith of miracles Mat. 17.20. if you had faith but as a grain of
mustard seed^, you would say to this mountain, remove hence to yonder place,
and it would remove. This has been given for a certain time, even to
Reprobates, as we see by Judas, who had this gift of miracles with the rest of
the Apostles, Matthew. 10.8.
, or for saving faith Saving faith, which is proper to the Elect, is that which
we defined.
.

II. The principal efficient cause of this is God; the impulsive, is the same
grace by which we are elected and called.

Act. 13.48. And they believed, so many as were ordained to life eternal. Romans
11 7. The Election has obtained, but the rest are blinded.

III. Faith then is a free gift, both in that we have not deserved it and
because it is infused into us by the Holy Ghost.

This is against S^cinus, who calls faith a free gift, not because the Holy
Ghost has infused it, but because no man has deserved it: but that faith is
the gift of God, is plain; Phil. 1.29. For to you it is given in the behalf of
Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for him.

IV. The instrumental cause by which Faith is given to us, is ordinarily the
word of God, in those that are of years.

Romans 10.17. Faith comes, by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.

V. Therefore the bare preaching of the Gospel is not the cause of Faith, but
as it is joined with the power of Gods Spirit.

Act. 16.14. The Lord opened the heart of Lydia, that she attended to the
things that were spoken of Paul.

VI. The matter or object is commonly Gods Word; but properly, the free
Promises grounded on Christ.

The Pontificians deny this latter part, against plain Scripture. Rom 3.22 The
righteousness of God by the faith of Jesus Christ, unto all and upon all that
believe. and v. 25. whom God has set forth to be a Propitiation through faith
in his blood: and c. 10 9. if thou do confess with thy mouth the Lord
Jesus, and believe in thy he^rt that God raised him from the dead, thou shall
be saved.

VII. The from of Faith, for our better understanding, is divided into three
parts; Knowledge, Assent, and Confidence.

Knowledge is, the understanding of things necessary to salvation. Assent is,
by which we firmly believe those things to be true, which are delivered in Gods
Word. Confide^^e is that, whereby every faithful man applies the promises of
the Word to himself.

VIII. There is knowledge and assent, both in saving, and in historical faith;
but confidence is only in saving faith.

Confidence is called by the Apostle (...) persuasion, and (...) much
assurance, (...). 3.12. 1 Thessalonians. 1 5. By the name then of Confidence is
understood, either the apprehension and application of Christ with his
benefits, or the quietness of conscience. In the former sense, it is the form
of faith; in the latter, the effect.

IX. Implicit faith then, which is the belief of the Church of Rome, with a
blind assent, is no faith.

Faith cannot be without knowledge, 1. Because it comes by hearing, and
hearing by the word of God, Romans 10.7.2. Because that is wisdom by which God
is known, Isa. 53 11. Jer. 31.34. Joh 6.69. and. 17 3. 1 Cor. 1.21.

X. Nor is that better than a mere historical faith, which is not joined with
firm confidence,

The Papists tea^h^^ that faith is on^y in the understanding but not in the
will and heart: but the Scripture plainly teaches the contra^y; Romans 10.10.
with the heart we believe unto righ^eousnesse.

XI. Yet we teach not such a firm confidence, as if no ways tossed with
doubtings; but such a one as does not finally yield to doubtings.

XII. As for the effects or most proper acts of faith, S Paul rightly tells us,
that faith is the substance of things hoped for, and the evidence or
demonstration of things not seen, Heb. 11.1.

It is indeed the property of faith, to make future and not ex^stent things
present. So Abraham is said to see Christ's day, Joh. 8.56.

XIII. The subject of faith, are the elect called.

Of Infants faith, we spoke in the doctrine of Baptism

XIV. There are degrees of Faith; not only in different men, but also in one
and the same man: so that sometimes it is weaker, sometimes stronger, but so
that it can never be utterly lost.

Isa. 42.3. He shall not break the b^used reed nor quench the smoking flax.
Phil. 1.6. I am persuaded, that he who has begun a good work in you, will
perfect it until the day of Jesus Christ. Heb. 12 2. looking unto Jesus Christ,
the Author and finisher of our Faith.

CHAP. XXX of Justification.
THe mediate effects of Vocation proceeding from faith, are Justification,
Sanctification, Assurance of salvation, and Christian liberty.

Justification is Gods free action, whereby the Elect, through the most full
satisfaction of Christ, are absolved from their sins, and are declared
rightous, and inheritors of life eternal.

The RULES.
I. Justice in Scripture, is either of the Cause, or of the person. Justice of
the cause is, when a man, otherwise sinful, is said in this or that particular
to be innocent and just: Justice of the person, is either begun, or it is
perfected. This is called Legal, as it is required by the Law; and Evangelical,
as it is showed in Christ by the Gospel. Begun justice, is that which the Holy
Ghost begins in the faithful in this life, and perfects it in the other. The
perfect righteousness of Christ then is the gift of Justification; but that
which is begun, is the gift of Sanctification.

II. To justify, in this place, is not to punish, nor to infuse inherent
righteousness, as the Pontificians will have it: but in the sense it is taken
in the Courts of justice, it is to absolve from sin, and to pronounce one just.

Prove. 17.15. To justify the wicked, and to condemn the just, both are
abomination to the Lord. Isa. 5.23. which justify the wicked, and take away
the righteousness of the righteous. Matthew. 11.19. wisdom is justified by her
children, Lu. 7.29. when these things were heard, all the people and the
Publicans justified God. Luke 10.29. He willing to justify himself.

III. The efficient cause of Justification, actively understood, is the whole
Trinity.

2 Cor. 5.19. God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself. 1. Cor.
6.11. But you are washed, but you are sanctified, but you are justified in name
of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.

IV. The internal moving cause ^is mere grace, or Gods free favor.

That this is a free favor, and not an infused grace, will appear by these
testimonies Romans 3.24. For they are justified freely by his grace, Ephesians. 2.8.
you are saved by grace through faith, and that not of your selves, it is the
gift of God. Tit. 3.4.5. But after the goodness and love of God our Savior
appeared toward man, not by the works which we had done, but by his mercy he
has saved us.

V. The external moving cause, is Christ, God and man.

Christ as the Son of God, is the efficient cause of justification in common
with the Father and Holy Ghost: but as he is God-man and our Mediator, he is
the outward moving cause, because by his merit he has procured this gift for
us.

VI. The instrumental cause of this, is the word of the Gospel.

For it is the power of God to every believer Romans 1.16.

VII. If we take Justification passively, in reference to man who is justified;
it has no other cause but faith, the instrumental.

VIII This phrase, We are justified by faith, is metonymical, and equivalent to
this; We are justified by Christ's merits apprehended by faith.

IX. Faith only is said to justify in respect of works; which are effects
following upon faith, but not the causes of Justification for they do not
precede him that is to be justified, but follow him that is justified.

Although this particle, [ alone] in so many letters and syllables; is not
found in Scripture, yet it is express^d by like phrases: Such are; Without
works freely by grace, Romans 3.24, 27, 28. But by faith, Ephesians. 2.8. Gal. 2.16.
Though then faith be not alone, but is joined with works, yet it justifies
alone: As the Sun is not in Heaven alone yet he alone makes day.

X. Faith does not justify as if it were a work, or by its own dignity, but as
it is an instrument apprehending Christ.

The Papists grant, that we are justified by faith: but then they take faith
here as a work. Now faith in Scripture has nothing ascribed to it, but as it
aprehends, as a Gold-ring bears a high price for the Jewel in it. And hence it
appears how finely those places of Scripture do agree, in which we are said to
be justified, now by grace, then by Christ's merits, then by faith: for we are
justified through Gods grace for Christ's merits apprehended by faith.

XI. The matter of justification taken actively, is Christ's whole satisfaction,
whereby he suffered the punishment due to our sins, and yielded perfect
obedience to the Law.

We have showed above, cap. 18. that Christ's satisfaction is placed both in his
suffering, and in his actual obedience.

XII. The matter of this taken passively, is man, miserable in himself, but
elected by God, called and endowed with faith. Though then vocation naturally,
is before faith, and faith before justification, yet in time there is no
difference.

For as soon as man is effectually called, he is endowed with faith, and
justified by faith.

XIII. The form of it, actively understood, is in the imputation of Christ's
whole satisfaction, whereby it is made all ours, as if we had performed it our
selves.

That justice which is imputed to the believer, is in Christ by inhesion, in us
by imputation. Our adversaries deny, that in Scripture there is any mention of
this imputation: But what can be cleerer than these ensuing places; Romans 4.6.
As David calls that man blessed, unto whom God imputeh righteousness without
works, Phil. 3.8.9. I account all things dung that I may gain Christ, and may
be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the Law, but
that which is by the faith of Christ, that is the righteousness which is of God
by faith. This is chiefly seen in that antithesis whereby our sins are imputed
to Christ, and his justice imputed to us. 2 Cor. 5 21. He made that he should
be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God
in him. The Papists also think it as absurd, that we should be justified by the
justice of another; as if one would be called learned for the learning that is
in another. But these examples are not like: for one man is not so united to
another, as the faithful are to Christ, their head, Again, they will not have
Christ's justice imputed to them; and yet they stick not to say, that the merits
of dead men, and the Justice of Monks are imputed to them.

XIV. Yet, for understandings sake, the form of justification is expressed by
two acts; by remission of sins, and imputation of justice; by judging our sins
to be none, and our righteousness to be perfect.

XV. And although these two benefits be the same in subject and time, yet they
are indeed distinct.

For they differ, 1. In definition: for it is one thing not to account us
unrighteous, and another thing to esteem us righteous. Which that we may the
better understand, we must know how these terms are different. Not just and
just* Unjust and just, Not just and Unjust: Not Unjust and just. Not just and
just, are contradictories, Unjust and just, are partly privatives, partly
contraries Not just, and unjust, also Not unjust and just, are diversa. We
must also know, that Unjust and just are not immediate contraries: for the
medium is innocent, who is neither unjust, nor just. Now whereas the remission
of sins, is a removing or putting away of our sins; but the imputat^on of
justice, is the adjudging of it to be ours: by that we are accounted for not
unjust or innocent; by this, for just. Now who knows not, that it is more to
be just, than to be innocent only; and not only to have done no evil, but
also to have done good? But although these two now in man differ not in subject
but in some respect only; yet heretofore they diffe^ed in subject also: For
Adam in Paradise was innocent, but not just; for he was at length to attain
justice by his perfect obedience. 2. They differ in their proximate and proper
causes, for Christ's death and passion are the cause of remission of sins, which
are expiated by them, Heb 9.22. without blood there is no remission, 1 John
1.7. The blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin But the cause of the
imputation of Justice, is Christ's perfect obedience, Romans 5.19. For as by the
disobedience of one man many are made sinners, so by the obedience of one many
are made righteous. We have showed above, cap 18. That this obedience is that
actual, by which he fulfilleth the whole Law for us. 3. They differ in their
proper effects, for by remission of sins we are freed from damnation; Romans 5.^.
Much more then no^ being justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath
through him: But by imputation of righteousness we attain over and above life
^ternal, Romans 5.17. Much more they which receive abundance ^f grace, and of the
gift of righteousness, shall reign, etc. so Gal. 4.5. both effects are put:
Made under the Law, that he might redeem them that are under the Law (that is
under the cu^se of the Law) and that we might recieve adoption. It is then a
greater benefit to redeem a Slave, and being redeemed to adopt him, than barely
to redeem; it is a greater favor to give and forgive; than only to forgive:
therefore that justificat^on is lame, by which only Christ, passion is imputed,
and which only consists in remissions of sins.

Here diverse things are objected, 1. The Scripture in many places makes mention
of Christ's passion, or Remission of sins only. But this is no wonder, for in
many places, it speaks Synecdochically; it^ sufficient that it explaines (...)
self in the above cited place^. 2. The Apostle promiscuously uses these
phrases as equivalent; to forgive sins, and to impute righteousness. Romans 4.5,
6. But we answer, that it is one thing for propositions to be equivalent, and
another thing for one proposition to follow upon, or to conclude another: as
Paul out of this phrase of David, Psalm. 32.2. Blessed are they whose sins are
forgiven them, etc. collects this, that David does describe him to be blessed
to whom righteousness is imputed without works. The reason of the consequence
is, because if the remission of sins be free, then so is also the imputation of
justice: Although then that is not formally spoken by David, which Paul
affirms, v. 5. yet it is spoken by way of consequence: yea it is an
argumentation, as Chrysostom says, from the lesser to the greater; for if he
be blessed whose sins are forgiven, then much more blessed is he to whom
besides righteousness is imputee. 3. To whom sins are forgiven, to him also
righteousness is imputed; and whosoever is freed from damnation, he is
inheritor of life eternal: therefore these benefits are not different. Answ.
Those things are not the same which are in the same subject together: For so it
would follow that Vocation, Justification, and Sanctification are not different
benefits, because every man that is called is also justified and sanctified. 4.
In the pardon of sins, there are the sin of omission pardoned; and therefore by
that man is made perfectly just: They add the reason of the consequence;
because he performs all things, who omits nothing, Ans The consequence is false,
because there is one cause why we are said to have omitted nothing, another,
why we are said to have done al things. We are said to have omitted nothing,
because Christ has suffered for our sins also of omission: But we are said to
have performed all things, because he has for us performed all things.
Besides, to have omitted nothing; and to have done all things, differ in
respect of punishment and reward: for although the fault and the punishment are
remited to him who omits what he should do, yet for this there is no reward due
to him. 5. It is absurd, that the same debt should be paid twice: If therefore
satisfaction is made for sin by Christ's suffering, satisfaction also is not to
be demanded by active obedience. Answ. Here is ignoratio Elenchi; for there is
not a double payment of the same debt, but two parts of one payment, Neither is
Christ's active obedience required to make satisfaction for sin, but to satisfy
for our interest in the Kingdom of Heaven. 6. If it be the same thing to be
liberal and not to be prodigal, nor covetous; then it is the same thing to be
just, and not unjust. Answ. The assumption is false, because these are not
immediate opposites; for there are men who are neither covetous, nor prodigal,
nor liberal. 7. If it be the same thing to be clothed, and to have nakedness
covered; then it is the same thing to have our sins remitted, and justice
imputed; because by the garment of (...) righteousness, (...) sins are also
(...) Ans. This is an (...) simile: for the sin^^r must not only be clothed,
but he must be first unclothed; to wit, from the rags of sin. Therefore as
Ioshuah the High Priest had his filthy garments taken from him first, then new
garments were put upon him, and a crown on his head, Zach. 3.4, 5. So we also
first must be divested of this dirty garment of sin, then we are clothed with
the glorious garment of Christ's righteousness.

XVI. The form of Justification, taken passively, is, whereby believers lay
hold on christ with all his merits, by the hand of ^aith, and apply him to
themselves.

XVII. The end of that benefit is, Gods ^lory and our salvation.

XVIII. Out of this commemoration (...) causes, we firmly gather, That man is
(...) justified before God by his good works (...) merits.

Reas. I. For to be justified by grace, and by merit, are repugnant. Romans 3.24.
They are justified freely by his grace, and v. 28. Therefore we conclude, that
a man is justified by faith without the works of the Law, and chap. 11.6. If by
grace, then not of works, otherwise grace were not grace. 2. So, to be
justified by Christ and his merits, and by works. Gal. 2.21. If righteou^ness
is of the Law, then Christ died in vain. 3. By faith, and by works. Rom 3.28 We
conclude then that we are justified by faith without works 4 To be justified by
imputed justice, and by works Romans 4.4, 5, To him that works is the reward
not reckoned of grace, but of debt: But to him that works not, but believes
on him that justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.
II. If by justification, all matter of bragging is excluded, that God only may
be glorified; then we are not justified by works. Romans 3.19, That every mouth
may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God, and ver. 23.
They have all sinned, and come short of the glory of God and v. 27. Where is
boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? nay but by the law of
faith. The Pontificians here say; that in these places are meant only
ceremonial works. But he who will observe that Catologue of works rehearsed
cap. 1, 2.3. to the Romans, shall find, that not only ceremonial, but moral
works also are meant* III. If we be justified by works, then they are either
such as go before, or follow after regeneration. Bu^ with neither of these ar^
we justified: For be^fore regeneration, (...) works are merely evi^ and after,
imperfect^ good.

XIX. The effects of justification are Peace with God, an access to him with
boldness, a rejoicing in tribulation, and freedom from sin, not only in
respect of guilt, as the Papists say, but in respect of punishment too.

Otherwise Christ had suffered for us in vain, Isa. 53.4, etc. Neither do
divine chastisements come upon the Elect, that they might by them satisfy God;
but that they might be proved and bettered.

XX. Imputed righteousness is perfect and equal in all believers.

The imperfection of our faith is no hinderance: for as the same Jewel is
touched by the firm and infirm hand, so is the same Justice of Christ obtained
by the strong and weak believer.

XXI. The same is never to be lost.

For the gifts of Vo^ation are without repen^a^^^, Romans 11.^9.

XXII. It is also one.

Therefore when the Saints who are justified, pray for forgiveness of sins,
they do not so much respect or consider the act of justification, as the fruit,
certainty, and confirmation thereof.

XXIII. Justification before God, is by faith: Justification before men, is by
works.

Of this, see Iam 2.24. you see then that man is justified by works; and not by
faith alone. Which saying is not contrary to that of Romans 3.28. we conclude
then, that man is justified by faith without works. For there is meant that
justification which is before men; but here, that which is before God: there is
understood historical faith, which works not by charity; but here, that faith
which is true and lively. Others say that man is justified by work^, not as by
the cause, but as by the declarers and manifesters of justification.

CHAP. XXXI. Of Sanctification.
SAnctification follows, Justification: as the light follows the sun.

This is that free action of God, which sets at liberty the faithful ingrafted
into Christ, and justified by the Spirit, more and more from their native
corruption, and renews them to his image, that they may be fitted by good works
to glorify God.

The RULES.
I To sanctify, in this place, is not to separate from profane use, or to
dedicate to holy uses, but habitually to make holy.

In the former signification we are bid to sanctify the Sabbath.

II. It is called regeneration, renovation, conversion, penance, repentance and
glorification.

Yet these words are ambiguous, for the word regeneration, renovatino, and
conversion, is either equivalent to vocation and the gift of faith, or it
signifies newness of life, when in the very act man dies to sin and lives
to righteousness: in the first sens it goes before justification, and is the
cause thereof; in the latter, follows it and is the effect thereof, it is also
named penitence and resipiscence, from the effect: which words do as much
d^ffer, as the Hebrew terms Nicham and Schubh, or the Greek, (...). and (...):
for that is of the mind, this of the heart: that wicked men may also have,
this only the godly: albeit this difference does not still hold. It is called
glorification by way of inchoation or beginning, as it is a forerunner of
future glorification.

III. The efficient cause of this, is in general the whole Trinity;
particularly, and in respect of the terminus, the Holy Ghost, for this end sent
by Christ.

Hence he is called the Spirit of Sanctification, Romans 1.4.

IV. The internal impulsive cause, is Gods free bounty*

Tit. 3.4.5. But after the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared
toward man, not by works of righteousness which we had done, but according to
his mercy he has saved us by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the
Holy Ghost.

V. The external impulsive cause, is Christ with his merit and efficacy,
Ephesians. 5.25. Christ loved his Church, and gave himself for it, that he might
sanctify it.

VI. The external instrumental cause, is the doctrine of the Law and Gospel;
but the internal is Faith, the root of good works.

VII. To these we may add extraordinary means, whereby God casts down the
proud and raises the humble; such are afflictions, miracles, terrors, etc.

VIII In the first regeneration or vocation, m^n is merely passive; but in
sanctification, when he is endowed with saving faith, he is the chief agent of
his own actions, yet not without the special grace and motion of the Holy Ghost.

IX. The matter of sanctification is the whole man, with his intellect, will,
and affections.

1 These. 5.23. Now the very God of peace sanctify you throughout, and I pray
God your whole spirit, soul and body be preserved blameless until the coming
of our Lord Jesus Christ.

X. The form is expressed in two acts, in the aversion from evil, and
conversion to good Psalm. 34.14. Isa. 55.7.
: that is called the mortification of the old man; this, the vivification of
the new man Ephesians. 2.1. Col. 3 9 10.
: that, a crucifying and burying; this, a resurrection Rom, 6.2. etc. Gal. 2.20.
.

XI. The end of this, is Gods Glory, our salvation, and certainty thereof: for
there is no sign of election more evident.

2. Tim 2.21. If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel
unto honor sanctified, 1. Joh. 3 3. And who has this hope in him, purifieth
himself even as he is pure.

XII. Sanctification in this life is not perfect; hence the works of the Saints
are imperfect, for they feel a combat in them between the flesh and spirit,
so long as they live.

Romans 7.19, 23, 24, Gal. 5.17.

XIII. Sanctification differs from justification, I. In their genus; for the
justice of that is in the predicament of Quality, but the justice of this in
the categroy of Relation. II In their form; For, 1. In Justification, Faith as
a hand lays hold upon Christ's justice; in Sanctification it is considered as
the beginning and root of good works. 2. In Justification sin is taken a way
only in respect of the guilt and punishment; in Sanctification it is by
degrees abolished in respect of its existence. 3. In Justification Christ's
righteousness is imputed to us; in Sanctification a new and inherent justice is
infused into us. III. In degrees for Justification is one individual perfect
act, equally contingent to all; but Sanctification is a successive act by
degrees tending to perfection, and according to the variety of the gifts of the
Spirit, shining in some more, in some less.

CHAP. XXXII. Of the perseverance of the Saints.
SO much of Justification and Sanctification: Now follows the perseverance of
the Saints, and Christian Liberty. The perseverance of the Saints, is the gift
of God, whereby the Elect being justified and sanctified, are so confirmed by
the grace of Christ, through the Holy Ghost, that they can never utterly fall
from it.

The RULES.
I. By the word of perseverance, we do not here understand that, whereby the
Elect cannot fall into most grievous sins, whereby their Faith cannot be
weakened, whereby they cannot for a time lose the effectual presence of Gods
Spirit; but that, whereby they cannot totally and final^y fall off from Faith
and the grace of God.

II. The efficient cause of this, is God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

Joh. 10.27, 28, 29. My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow
me, and I give to them life eternal; neither shall they perish for ever, nor
shall any man take them out of my hand; my Father who has given them to me is
greater than all, nor can any man take them out of my Fathers hand: I and my
Father a^e one. Ephesians. 1.13* 14 In whom also after that you believed, you were
sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our
inheritance, until the redemption of the pu^chased possession, unto the praise
of his glory.

III. The matt^r, which has the nature of the subject, is man truly elected,
cal^ed, justified, and sanctified.

IV. The form consists, partly in the will to pers^vere* partly in the act
it self: the wi^^ is never defec^ive in the godly; but the act is sometime
ne^re intense, sometime more remise.

V. Though then Faith may be lost in respect of the second act; yet in respect
of the habit or first act by which it apprehends Christ, it is never lost.

VI. The end of this gift, is the assurance of our salvation, and a true and
firm comfort.

VII. Out of all this we conclude, that the Elect, who are called, justified,
and sanctified are assured of their salvation.

Besides the Scripture-testimonies cited above: 1. The certainty of our
Election confirms this; for the elect cannot perish, or become reprobate. Mat.
24.24. There will arise false Prophets, and fa^se Christ's, and will show great
signs and wonders so that they shall seduce if it be possible, the very elect.
2. Tim. 2.19. Yet the foundation of God stands fi^m, having this seal, the
Lord knows who are his. 2 The certainty of Vocation Romans 11.29. For the gifts
and calling of God are without repentance. 3, The certainty of Faith, Isa.
42.3. he will not break the bruised reed, nor quench the smoking flax. 4. The
certainty of Justification by which there is no condemnation to those who are
in Christ Jesus, Romans 8.1.5. The certainty of Sanctification. Phil. 1.6. Being
persuaded, that he who has begun a good work in you will perfect it until the
day of Jesus Christ. The testimonies which Bellarmine alleges to the
contrary, are either such as speak not of the faithful, but of hypocrites; as
Mat. 24.12, 13. Mark 4.15. Luke 8.13. John 15.2. Heb 6. v 4, 5, 6. and 10.26. 2
Pet. 2.21, 22. Or else of a falling off, not from the Faith, by which we
believe, but which be believe, that is, from wholesome doctrine, which
hypocrites also embrace for a time: as 1 Timothy 1.19. and 4.1. and 1 Timothy 6.19.
Or they are to be understood of those that are truly faithful, but
conditionally; as Ezekiel. 18.26. When a righteous man turns away, etc. and 1
Cor. 9.27. Gal. 5.4. The examples of evil Angels, and of our first Parents are
nothing to this purpose; for they received only possibility, if they would be
willing, but not will and possibility too: but there is another reason of the
regenerate, who by the grace of the Spirit both will, and can persevere.
Likewise the exmples of Saul, Simon Magus, and Judas are impertinent, for they
were Reprobates. David and Solomon fell indeed grievously, but they lost not
totally their Faith, as the repentance of both witness, Psalm. 51. and the Books
of Ecclesiastes. As for Peter's fall, we will say with Austine, Profession
failed in his mouth, but not faith in his heart. There be two Arguments of our
Adversaries chiefly to be considered. 1. It is temerity, say they, to boast of
the certainty of Faith, whereas our salvation should be wrought out with fear
and trembling, Phil. 2.12. Answ. The Elect are no ways to be accused of
temerity, because they ascribe not to their own strenth the certainty of
salvation, by which they may a thousand times fall off without Gods grace, but
they are kept by the power of God, 1 Pet. 1.5. Therefore fear and trembling are
not opposed to firm confidence in God, but to carnal presumption. 2. They say,
that all admonitions will be in vain* and so a way w^ll be made ^o carnal
security. Ans. This will not follow: For th^s Doctrine is so far from
occasioning security, that it rather draws us from it. 1. Because it is one
thing (...) stand, and another thing to seem to stand, 1 Cor. 10.12. 2. Because
no man can promise to himself the certainty of salvation, except he try his
Faith by his Sanctification: 3. Because, although the Saints do not utterly fall
off from grace, yet they may fall into most g^ievous sins, in offending God and
their neighbor, and may bring upon themselves diverse calamities.

CHAP. XXXIII. Of Christian Liberty.
CHristian Liberty is a spiritual manumission or freedom, whereby the
faithful are delivered from that slavery, to which they were bound before
their conversion, that they may freely and cheerfully obey God.

The RULES.
I. The efficient cause of this liberty in general, is the whole Trinity; but
in particular, Christ our Lord.

Joh. 8.31, 32. If you abide in my word you shall be my D^sciples, and ye shall
know the truth* and the truth shall make you free. and v. 36. Therefore if the
Son make you f^ee, ye shall be free indeed.

II. The instrumental cause of this, is Faith.

III The matter, or subject, are faithful men.

IV. The matter about which this is conversant, are the Law, the service of sin
and death, affliction of conscience in things indifferent, and men's
commandments.

V The form is expressed by diverse conditions, as the objects are various.

VI. We have showed above in the doctrine of the Law, how we are freed from the
Law.

VII. We are not quite in this life free from the inherence of sin in us; but
we are freed from the guilt and dominion of it; from that by justification,
from this by sanctification.

Romans 6.12. Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal bodies, that you should
obey sin in the lusts thereof.

VIII. From indifferent things, that is such as are neither commanded nor
prohibited, we are so freed, that our conscience is not bound to keep or break
them.

Romans 14 2.3. For one believes that he may eat all things, another who is weak
eats herbs, let not him that eats, despise him that eats not, and let
not him that eats not, condemn him that eats.

IX. Now in these cases a special care must be had of Faith and charity: of
faith, lest we take things not indifferent for indifferent; of charity, lest we
offend our weak brother.

Of Faith Paul spakes, Romans 14^23. He that doubts, if he eat, he is already
condemned, because he eats not of faith, but what is not of faith is sin: of
Charity cap. 14. ver. 1. He that is weak in the faith, receive you, but not
unto doubtful disputation, etc.

X. The same care of liberty is about men's commandments; for our conscience,
is not obliged to those things which are against Gods commands, or being
adiaphorous are obtruded as necessary; but we must not for conscience refuse
obedience to those things that are consonant to Gods command.

XI. The end of this liberty, 1. Is true consolation arising out of our freedom
from sin, death, and solicitude in things indifferent: 2. The service of
righteousness, which indeed is true liberty: 3. The true worship of God, free
from superstition or the scandal of our neighbor.

XII. Contrary to Christian liberty, is the ^iberty of the flesh and
wantonness.

Jud. v. 4. there are some men crept in now, of old ordained for this
condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into wantonness.

CHAP. XXIV Of the coming of Christ, and Resurrection of the flesh, which go
before the last Judgment.
HItherto of the State of Grace, now follows the State of Glory.

To this belongs the doctrine of the last Judgment

The parts whereof are three: 1. Of its Antecedents: 2. Of the Judgment it
self: 3 Of the Consequents thereof.

The Antecedents are, Christ's coming, and the Resurrection of the flesh.

Christ's last coming, is his return from Heaven, to which he ascended, to judge
the Earth.

The RULES.
I. It is most certain, that Christ will return to Judgment.

This was revealed even in the Patriarks times: Iud. v 14 Enoch also the
seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold the Lord comes wi^h
ten thousand of his Saints, to execute judgment upon all, and to convince all
that are ungodly among them, of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly
committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken
against him. The rest of the Scripture is full of such testimonies. Psalm. 50,
3, etc. Dan. 12. Matt. 24. and 25. Act. 17. Romans 2. and 14. 2 Cor. 5.10. 1 Thessalonians, 4. and 5. 2 Pet. 3. Rev* 19, etc.

II. Although no man knows the time of Christ's coming exactly, in respect of
the day and hour Of that day and hour knows no man, not ^he Angels of heaven,
excep^ my Father only, Mat. 13. 32. Nor the Son himself but the Father alone, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 1. 2, etc. concerning the times and seasons, brethren, it is not
needful that I write unto you; for you your selves know well, that that day of
the Lord will come as a thief in the night.
yet there are signs set down by Christ and his Apostles, showing that that
day is not far off Mat. 24.32.33. Learn a parable of the fig tree: when its
branch is yet tender and puts forth ^ leaves, ye know that summer is nigh;
so likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even
at the doors.
.

III. These Signs are either common or proper.

IV. Those are common, which were to signify both the destruction of
Jerusalem, and Christ's last coming.

Such were those predict^ons of Christ, Mat. 24.4, 5. etc. when he speaks both
of his own coming, and of the destruction of Jerusalem as the type thereof; to
wit, False Prophets, false Christ^, wars. pestilence, famine, earthquakes,
persecutions for Christ's sake, treacheries, want of faith and charity, etc.

V. The proper signs are, extreme security and impiety Luc. 17.26.27. As it
was in the days of Noah, etc. And as it fell out in the day, of Lots etc. 1 Thessalonians. 5.3. when they shall say peace and safety, then sudden destruction
comes upon them; as travel upon ^ woman with child, and they shall not
escape. 2 Timothy 3.1, 5. This know that in the last days perilous times shall
come; for men shall be lovers of their own selv^s, covetous, boasters proud,
blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural
affection, truce breakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce despisers of
those that are good, traitors etc.
, the revealing of Antichrist and his destruction by the breath of Christ mouth
2 These. 2.3. Let no man deceive you by any means; for that day shall not come
till there be a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of
perdition. and v. 8 And then shall tha^ wicked one be revealed, whom the Lord
shall c^^sume wi^h the Spirit ^f his mouth, and shall d^^troy with the
brigh^n^sse of his coming
, The ruin of Rome Rev. 18.2. She is fal^en, she is fallen that great Babylon,
etc.
, with the forsaking and burning of the Whore Rev. 17.16. And those ten horns,
that is, the ten Kings, shall hate the whore, and they shall forsake her and
shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.
,

VI To these signs some add, A visible and general uniting of the Jews to
the Church of Christ, which they teach must be expected in the last times.

A. R. This opinion of the calling of the Jews, is plausible, if it were found
in Scripture] Here Wollebius strives to weaken the opinion of the Jews
conversion before the last day; so did of old Caesariensis, Greg Nazianzen 's
brother, Dial. 4. by denying, that in Scripture their conversion is expressed,
whereas indeed the Scripture in many places speaks of this general calling.
And though H^erome on Isa. 11. and Hos. 9. seem to con^radict this truth; yet
we shall find, that he does not absolutely speak against their final
conversion, bu^ against the manner of it, which the Jews thought should be
effected by Elias, whom they dreamed would reduce them again into their own
Country, and re-establish the ancient Law of Moses, and the whole Iudaical
worship. But to deny a total conversion of the Jews to Christ, is to keep up
the partition wall still, which Christ came to break down, represented by the
rupture of the veil of the Temple at Christ's death. Why was Christ called the
Cornerstone, if he did not mean to unite the two walls of the Jew and Gentile?
And how can that proph^sie of his be fulfilled, There shall be one sheepfold,
as there is but one Shepherd? That p^ophesie of Zach. 12.10 Rev. 1.7. They
shall look on him whom they have pierced, and shall mourn for him; must be
^nderstood of the Jews final conversion, which shall be with godly sorrow and
repentance, before the last day, for it is said there, He shall come with
clouds, Luke 21.27. Our Savior foretells, that Jerusalem shall be ^^dden under,
till the fullness of the Gentiles* be brought in. We read in Rev. 7. that
besides the innumerable multitude of all Nations that stood before the Lamb,
there were of the Israelites also an hundred forty and four thousand on Mount
Sion; a definite number being used for an indefinite: by which is intimated the
Jews total conversion. In Mal. c, 4. Elias is promised to turn the hearts of
the fathers toward their children: which prophecy the old Doctors apply to
the conversion of the Jews by the preaching of Elias; and Christ tells us, that
Elias shall come and restore all things, Matthew 17.11. This prophecy indeed is
applied by Christ to his first coming, and ^ohn Baptist there is called Elias;
yet this hinders not the application of the same prophecy to his second
coming also: before which, either Elias shall come, or else powerful
p^eachers, in the force and spirit of Elias, who shall convert the Jews: And so
the Fathers interpret these words Psalm. 59 6, 14. They shall return in the
evening of the conversion of the Jews in the end of the world: And so they
observe, that their late entry into the Church of Christ, which is the House of
the living God, was prefigured by the elder brother Luke 15. Who came not in
till he was entreated by his father; and that was after the younger brother, or
gentiles had returned. But their conversion is more plainly foreto^^ by Hose^.
1.11. The children of Judah and (...) shall be gathered together, and appoint
themselves one Head* This cannot be meant so much of their return from their
dispersion in their first captivity, as of their last conversion; for the
Is^aelites never returned from their first captivity. This is more fully
explained in Hosea, c. 3* 5* Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and
seek the Lord their God, and David their King; and shall fear the Lord and his
goodness in the latter days. Here by the latter days we cannot understand
Christ's first coming; for we do not find, that this prophecy has been yet
accomp^^shed. Some few here and there have been converted; but what is that to
a general conversion of the whole nation, or at least, of the greatest part?
which the Apostle expresses fully, Romans 11, 2^ I would not, brethren, have you
ignorant of this mystery, that blindness in part is happened to Israel until the
fullness of the Gentiles be come in, and so all Israel shall be saved: and ver.
32. God has concluded them all in unbelief; that he might have mercy on all:
Now all the circumstances and wo^ds, preceding and following, do make it plain,
that Saint Paul speaks not of the spiritual, but of the carnal Israelites, or
Nation of the Jews, and of their total conversion, which v 12. he calls their
fullness, as he calls the total conversion of the Gentiles, the fullness of the
Gentile, verse. 25. And doubtless, Christ who came to save his people from
their sin^, to whom he preached in his own Person, and sent his Disciples,
first of all to these lost sheep of Israel, and prayed for them on the cross,
and makes intercession for them still in Heaven; will not forget, when the time
comes; to bring back these straying sheep into his sheepfold: This is that
Michael the great Prince, who stands up for the children of Israel, and b^
whom Daniels people shall be delivered, every (...) written in the Book of
life, Dan. 12.1. So certain and indubitable was this truth, that in the
primitive Church, as Saint Austin confesses, l. 20. de civ Dei, cap. 29. It
was ordinarily spoken and believed by the faithful, that the Jews by the
preaching of Elias should believe in Christ. Yet I deny not but that the Jews
hitherto have been like that fruitless Fig Tree in the Gospel which our Savior
cursed; but here is the difference, that the Fig Tree was nev^^ to fructify
any more, but we must not say so of (...) Jews: I grant also, that the Fathers
believed the Jews shall follow Antichrist; because he says, that if another
come in his own name, him they will receive: but it will not therefore follow,
that they shall never have their eyes opened to discern the falsehood of
Antichrist, and that they shall never follow Christ. Neither does Saint Paul
contradict himse^f, who having proved the conversion of the Jews, says, 1
These. 2.16. That wrath is come upon them to the end. For he speaks there only
of those perverse Jews, who lived in his time they having crucified Christ,
pe^^^cuted his followers; therefore final destruction (...) upon them under
Titus; or else, (...) (...) signifies utterly, as we translate it; and so
ex^rea^e or utter destruction came upon them. And whereas it is said, Hos. 1.6.
That God will have mercy no more upon the house of Israel but will utterly take
them away; this was spoken of ^he ten tribes captivity from which they were not
deliverd, as the House of Judah was ver. 7. But what is this to the final
conv^^sion of the Jews? As for those imprecations of David against them, Psalm.
69. v 23.24.25. they have relation only to their temporal punishments* and
outw^rd afflictons; and not to a final or endless obstinacy. To conclude, the
Apostle proves out of Isa. 59.20. That all Israel shall be saved, because there
shall come to Sion, (or as the LXX. translate it) out of Sion, the deliverer,
and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob, Romans 11.26. This Prophecy has not
been yet accomplished, therefore it is to be fulfilled in the end of the world,
when the deliverer shall turn away ungodliness from the whole Nation of the
Jews.
This opinion is plausible, if it were found in Scripture. The Prophetical
testimonies which they allege were fulfilled in the Apostles times, when upon
the breaking down of the partition wall* the Jews and Gentiles were united into
one body. In the Revela^ion we find nothing that does solidly confirm this
opinion, Their chief hold is in that of Romans 11.25.26. For I would not bre^hren
^ that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ^ should be wise in your
own conceit, that blindness in part is happened to Israel; until the fullness of
the Gentiles be come in, and so all Israel shall be saved. The Apstles scope in
this is; to dehort Christians from insulting over the Jews that are rejected,
because they themselves are called. The reason is, because by their ruin the
gentiles have received salvation, ver. 11. Yet so that all hope of
reconciliation is not cut off from the Jews, ver. 1^. Nor are they exempted
from being rejected, who being Christians only in name, are puffed up in their
minds, ver. 20.21. That former passage of the rejection of the Jews, which was
not altogether without hope of pardon, does show in a mystery that the Jews
were not totally, but in part only rejected; not in respect of time, for it
was to last only awhile, but in respect of that part of the Jewish Nation
which contains the Reprobates: so that the meaning is this; blindness has
happened not to all the Jews, but to a part only, that is, to the Reprobates.
Neither have these words, until the fullness of the Gentiles come in, this
meaning; that there shall be such a plausible calling of the Jews, after the
fullness of the Gentiles is come in: For there is nothing more usual than that
th^se particles till, or until, and while, being denied or affirmed, signify
the same that never or always: As we showed above, c. 19. Neither does that
which the Apostle subjoyns, v. 26. hinder anything this interpretation, And so
all Israel shall be saved: For by the name of all Israel, he understands the
elect, which indeed are the true Israelites, as above c. 9.7, etc. he shows.
And also in the following places, v. 28. c. 11, he explains, saying, As
concerning the Gospel, they ar^ Enemies for your sakes; but as touching the
Election, they are beloved for their fathers sakes. The sum of the whole
place is this, the rejection of the Jews Nation in part, (whereby blindness
shall remain upon the Reprobates) does no ways prejudice the elect of that
same Nation, but they also, and so all Israel shall be saved. See Calvin on
this place.

VII. The sign of Christ's presence shall be, doubtless, an incredible
brightness, and majesty, in which he shall appear.

For he shall come in the clouds of Heaven, Matthew. 26.64. with incredible
glory, Matthew. 25 31. accompanied with the whole army of his Angels ^ib. with a
great shout and voice of the Archangel, 1 Thessalonians. 4.16. By reason of his
brightness, the Sun and and moon shall be darkened (as lesser lights by the
greater) and Stars shall fall from Heaven, that is, they shall seem to fall
from Heaven, and the powers of Heaven shall be shaken Mat. 24.29. etc. Mar.
13.24. etc. yea, at his sight, Heaven, and earth shall seem to f^ie away, Rev.
20, 11

Thus of Christ's coming: The resurrection of the dead is, whereby the bodies of
the dead shall be raised, but the bodies of those that remain alive, shall be
changed, and shall be again united to their souls by an indissolveable union.

The RULES.
I. The Resurrection, called by the Greeks (...) and (...), is First, or
Second. That is a resuscitation from the death of sin to the life of
righteousness; This is a revocation from death corporal to life.

Rev. 20.6. Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection.

II. The Scripture proves the Resurrection of the dead, by testimonies Job.
19.25, 26. Dan. 12.2. Hos. 13.14. Matthew. 22.31. etc. and 27.52. Ioh. 5.28, 29
Phil. 3.21. 1 Thessalonians 4. and other such like places.
, examples The example of those that were raised by the ministry of Elijah, 1
King. 17 22. Elisha, 2 King. 4.34. 2 King 13.21. by Christ also Matthew. 9.25.
and c. 27.52.53. Luke 7.14. Ioh. 11.11. and by the Apostles, Act. 9.40. and
20.10.
, types The type of Aarons Rod budding, Number. 17. of the Jews returning from
Babylon, Ezekiel. 37. but chiefly of Henoch and Elias, Genesis 5 and 2 King: 2.
, and reasons Reasons are drawn from the Covenant of God, which is not broken
by death, Matthew 22.30. from the promises of life eternal: from the Sacraments
which are s^ales thereof: which 1 Cor. 15. are set down at large. But the chief
reason is drawn from Christ, who is not only the type and example of our
resurection but the beginning also thereof; for from the life of the Head we
undoubtedly gather the life of the mystical body.
.

III. Though the Resurrection of the dead is above nature, and man's corrupt
reason; yet it is neither against nature, nor against right reason.

For right reason teaches, that the dead can be raised, and shall be raised:
That, is gathered from his omnipotency; this, from his justice. For as it is
just that some sins be punished after this life; so it is just likewise, that
what was the companion of sin, should be the companion of pain.

IV. The general efficient cause of the Resurrection, is the whole Trinity; the
particular is Christ our Lord.

Christ is the efficient cause of this three ways 1. As God. 2. As the Judge of
the world. 3. As Mediator. The first two ways, he is the efficient cause of
resurrection both in the elect and in the reprobate: but the third way, he is
the cause of the resurrect^on of the faithful, by his merit, efficacy, and
inchoation.

V. The matter is the same numerical body that man had in this life.

Besides Jobs testimony. Job 19.26. the reason annexed to the third Canon,
taken from Gods justice proves this.

VI. The form, consists in the reunion of body and soul, and restoring of the
dead to life, and in the sudden change of those that remain, and in their
freedom from corruption.

1 Cor. 15.51.

VII. The end, is the declaration of Gods justice, and mercy: of that, in
raising the wicked to condemnation; of this, in raising the godly to life
eternal.

Dan. 12.2. Joh. 5.28.29.

VIII. In the Resurrection the godly shall be freed, not only from corruption
and bodily defects, but shall be crowned also with glory.

1 Cor. 15, 42, 43, 44. It is sowed in corruption, it is raised in
incorruption; it is sowed in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sowed in
weakness, it is raised in power; it is sowed a natural body, it is raised a
spiritual body.

CHAP. XXXV. Of the last Judgment.
SO much of the antecedents of the last Judgment: The Judgment it self is
that most glorious act, whereby Christ shall judge the whole Word.

The RULES.
I. The certainty of the last judgment, is proved by the same arguments, by
which we proved the certainty of Christ's coming, and of our resurrection.

II. The general efficient principal cause is the whole Trinity; the
particular, is Christ our Lord in the assumed humane nature, but glorified.

III. The chief power of Judicature shall be in Christ; for to him all power is
given, and from whom no appeal can be made to any superior.

IV. This Judge shall be visible and conspicuous to all, both in respect of his
brightness and majesty in which he shall appear, as also of his humanity.

But so, that his sight shall be terrible to the wicked; joyful to the godly.

V. The instrumental cause, are the Angels whose service he shall use, both in
gathering together those that are to be judged, and in separating the godly
from the wicked.

Matthew. 22.31. And he shall send his Angels with a great sound of the Trumpet,
and they shall gather the elect from the four winds, and 25, 32. And all
Nations shall be gathered before him, and he shall separate the one from the
other, as the sh^pherd separates the sheep from the goats.

VI. The matter, shall be all men, who must appear before Christ's tribunal.

Romans 14.10. 2 Cor. 5.10.

VII. But the gody shall be judged one way, and the wicked another way: For,
they shall be judged, but not condemned; these shall be judged and condemned.

In this sense, the Scripture denies that the faithful shall be judged, Ioh
3.18. and 5.29.

VIII. Neither matters it, that the wicked are said to be judged already: For
it is one thing to be judged in private, another in public and openly.

IX. The form, is expressed by the manner of proceedings in the Courts of
justice; to which belongs, 1. The cognizance of the cause. 2. The pronouncing
of the sentence. 3. The execution thereof.

X. The cognisanse of the cause, is expressed by the similitude of records or
books, in which their works are registered

Rev. 20.12. And the Books were opened, etc. A. R. By these Books are meant
partly Gods omniscience, partly men's conscience.] God to whom all things are
naked and open, needs not books to help his memory, as men do; yet we read that
he has two books, the one is called the book of life, the other of knowledge.
Of the former there are four kinds, the first is of Predestination to life
eternal, and in this book some are so written, that they cannor be blotted out;
others are written but in appearance and hope; for when they live for a while
in the fear of God, they hope their names are recorded in Heaven; but when by
their wickedness they fall from this hope, then they may be said to be blotted
out of this Book; this is the Book of life eternal. 2. The Book of life
^emporary which is nothing else but the condition and estate of this life: out
of this Book did Moses David, and Paul w^sh themselves to be blotted. 3. The
Scripture is the book of Life, as containing those precepts and means by which
we may obtain Life eternal. The 4. Book of Life is our conscience informing us
of all the good and bad actions of our former life. This Book is opened
sometimes in this life; but shall be fully laid open to us in the last day. The
other Book we read of, is of knowledge: which is threefold, 1 The Book of Gods
general knowledge, wh^reby he takes notice of all men, whether they be good or
bad; ^f this every man may say with David, Psalm 139 16. In thy Book are all my
members written. 2 The Book of Gods particular knowledge: of this, Psalm. 1. The
Lord knows the ways of the righteous, and 2 Timothy 2. The Lord knows who are
his: this is the knowledge of approbation: in this Book they are not w^itten,
to whom Christ will say in the last day, Depart from me, etc. I know you not:
of this David speaks, Psalm. 69 28. Let them be blotted out of the Book of the
living; and not be written with the righteous! The third book of knowledge, is
that wherein the actions of wicked men are recorded, and which shall be laid
open to them, Dan. 7.10. The Judgment was set, and the Books opened. We may say
then that God has two books, which like Ezekiels scroll are written within and
without* in the inside are the names of the Saints, who persevere to the end;
On the outside are the names of the wicked, who fall from grace, who begin in
the spirit but end in the flesh Of these books see Exo. 32.32, Ps^ 69.28, etc.
Phil. ^.3. Rev. 3* 5. and ^7.^* and ^0, 15. and. 21.27.
By these Books are meant; partly Gods omniscience, and partly men's conscience.

X. The wicked shall be judged according to, and for their works; but the godly
according to the works of their faith, but not for their works.

Hence, Rev. 20.12. Another Book is said to be opened, which is ^he book of
life. That we might know, That our salvation depends not on our works, but on
Gods eternal grace, whereby we are written in the Book of life.

XII The infidelity and impiety of the wicked, shall be so laid open before
their eyes in their own conscience, that they shall not be able to deny or
gainsay any thing.

Psalm. 50.^1. I will reprove thee, and set these things in order before thine
eyes. Matthew. 12.36. But I say unto you, whatsoever idle word (...) shall speak,
they shall give an acc^unt thereof in the day of judgment.

XIII. Although the Elect shall remember their sins, yet they shall be so fi^ed
with the joy of the Spirit, that the remembrance thereof shall not sad them.

XIV. Both Reprobate and elect shall hear the sentence of the Judge to the one
it shall be full of horror, to the other full of comfort.

Mat 25 34. Come ye blessed of my Father, possess the Kingdom prepared for you
from the beginning of the world; and v. 41. Go ye cursed into everlasting fire,
prepared for the Devil and his Angels.

XV. The execution of the Judgment will presently follow upon the pronouncing
of the sentence: So that the wicked in the presence of the godly shall be
carried away to Hell; but the godly being caught up to meet Christ, they shall
with him enter into life eternal.

Mat. 25, ult. 1 These. 4 17.

XVI. The end of the last Judgment, is a full and consummate execution of Gods
counsel, for manifesting his justice and grace.

XVII. We must not rashly define where the place of the last judgment shall be.

Some will have it to be in the valley of Iehosaphat, which is between the
hills Sion and Oliver; and that Christ shall descend no lower than to that part
of the air in which a cloud took him up: which they gather out of the Prophecy
of Joel, cap. 3.2. But that place speaks nothing of the last judgment, but of a
temporary judgment to be inflicted on the Enemies of the Church of Israel*
alluding to that great overthrow which was given in the valley of Iehosaphat,
which was in the sight of Jerusalem. But if this be transferred anagogically to
the last Judgment, this will be the meaning: As the Enemies of Iehosaphat, and
of the Jews were slain in the fight of Jerusalem; so likewise shall the
Infidels be judged and thrown down to Hell, in the sight of spiritual
Jerusalem, that is, the Church: And in this sense the Apostles, Mat. 19.28 the
Martyrs, Rev. 20.4. yea, all the Faithful, 1 Cor. 6.2, 3. shall judge the
World and the Devils: Not that Christ will share with the Saints the honor of
Judicature, but that they shall approve of the sentence, and shall p^aise the
wisdom and justice of the celestial Judge.

CHAP. XXXVI. Of the end of the world, and life eternal, the Consequents of the
Judgment.
THere are two consequents of the last Judgment; to wit, the end of the World,
and Life eternal.

The end of the World, is the destruction of this visible Universe, after the
wicked are thrust down to Hell, and the godly elevated into the Heaven of the
blessed.

The RULES
I. This is called the consummation of the World.

Mat. 24 3. and 28.^^

II. The efficient cause of this consummation shall be God; for it belongs to
the same power to create and to destroy the world.

III. The matter i^ this visible world, heaven and earth, and the things
therein contained.

Peter expressly names the heavens, and the elements with the earth and its
contents, 2 Pet. 3.10, 11, 12.

IV Neither Hel^, nor the Heaven of the blessed shall be destroyed.

For there the w^^ked shall be eternally tortured, and here the godly for ever
glorifi^d.

V. Concerning the form of this consummation, it is demanded, 1. Whether it
shall be mediate or immediate? 2. In the substance, or qualities only?

VI. Peter answers the first question, saying God will destroy it by fire.

2 Pet. 3.6, 7. The wo^ld that then was, perish^d by water being overflow^d;
but the heavens and the earth which are n^w* by the same word are kept in
sto^e* reserved unto fi^e etc and v. 10 The heaven^ shall pass away with a
great n^ise, and the element^ shall (...) with fervent heat, the earth also and
works therein shall be burned up: and v. ^2 The heavens being on fire shall be
dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat. But what kind of
fire thi^ shall be, he only know who is himself (...) co^suming fire

VII. Concerning the other question, there be diverse opinions. For some will
have this world de^troyed in its substance; others, in its qualities only.

They who think it shall be destroyed only in quality, by this word
consumation, mean a purg^ng and instauration. Being moved, ^. By testimonies.
Romans 8 19, 20, 21, 22. For the earnest expectation of the crea^ure wai^eth for
the manifestation of ^he sons of God. For the c^eature was made subject to
vanity, not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope,
because the creature it self also shall be delivered from the bondage of
corruption into the glorious liber^y of the sons of God: For we know that the
who^^ crea^ion groaneth, and traveleth in pain together until now 1 Cor. 7.31.
The fashion o^ figure of this world passes away. 2 Pet. 3.13. But we (...) for
new hea^ns and a new earth according to promise Rev. 2^.^ ^h^n I saw a new
heaven and a new earth. II. By reasons. 1. In the deluge, the earth was not
destroyed in i^s substance. 2. Because man shall not be changed in his
substance, but in his qualities. But they who are of the contrary opinion, I.
Rely on these Scriptures Psa 102.26, 27. and Heb. 1.11. They shall perish, but
thou do remain; they all shall wax old as does a garment; and thou shall
change them as a vesture, etc. Isa. 51. 6. Lift up your eyes to heaven, and
behold the earth below; the Heavens shall vanish as smoke, and the earth shall
wax old as a garment. Matthew. 24.35. Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my
words shall not pass away, 2 Pet. 3 7. But the Heavens and the Earth which now
are, by the same word are laid up in store, and reserved for fi^e, etc. and
verse 10. The Heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements
shall melt with fervent heat; the earth and all therein shall be burned, and v.
12. The A. R. The heavens shall not be purged with fire, because they are not
capable of an elementary impression. 2. Because they are not subject to the
vanity, motion, and corruption of inferior bodies. 3. The^r innovation shall
only be in their rest and cessa^ion from motion. 4. The Heavens that shall be
purged by fire, are the aerial only. 5. The fire shall purge no more, than
what the water did purge in the Flood of Noah.
Heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the Elements shall melt, etc.
Rev. 21.1 The first Heaven, and the first Earth passed away, and there was no
more Sea. II. Reasons. 1. Because this visible world was made for man to
sojourn in whilst he was a traveller; but when his journey is ended, and he in
Heaven, there will be no more need of this world. 2. Because this stands with
the order of things: For seeing eternity belongs to God, who is without
beginning and ending; but to Spirits, aevum, which is that duration that has
beginning, but wants ending to Physical things time is ascribed, consisting
both of beginning and ending. To the former objections thus they answer: The
place of Romans 8.19, 20, 21, 22. is not meant of the restoration of this world,
but of its freedom from vanity, to which it is subject, which vanity consists
in this, that most men do most wickedly abuse the service of the creatures;
hence by Prosopopoeia or fiction of the person, they are said to desire
liberty. The place in 1 Cor. 7.31. teaches rather the contrary, to wit, that
this world shall not remain; although in that place mention is not made of the
world it self, so much as worldly things, to wit, riches pleasures and such
like. They teach, that the new heaven in 2 Pet. 3. and Rev. 21. does as it were
point out the new world which the elect shall inhabit in their heavenly
country. For there is nothing more frequent than that allegory, whereby the
heaven of ^he blessed is likened sometimes to the earth, sometimes to the
visible heaven: and to this purpose, is that which Peter says of
righteousness, which shall dwell there For it is certain, that after this
world, justice shall dwell no where but in heaven. To the first reason, they
answer, that there is no consequence from the Flood to the last Judgment,
because the Flood brought not with it the end of the world: so likewise in the
other reason, they deny the sequel from man to the world; because the world
will be no ways available to man, when he is advanced to life eternal, for it
was made only for him whilst he was a traveler here. Now although in
controversies of this nature, which overthrow not the articles of Faith, it be
lawful to suspend o^r assent; yet, without prejudice to other men's judgments,
the understanding reader may subscribe to the latter opinion: for it is one
thing to be restored, and changed unto a better estate; and another thing to
wax old like a garment, to vanish like smoke, to be dissolved, to melt, to be
burned, to pass away; to be no more, as the fo^mer testimonies affirm.

So much of the end of the World; Life eternal is the highest degree of
blessedness, in which we shall be made partakers of Christ's glory, enjoying the
sight of God, and Heavenly joys for ever and ever.

The RULES.
I. The general efficient cause of life eternal in the whole Trinity, but
particularly Christ our Lord, who by his merit obtained life for us, and by his
efficacy applies it to us* and bestows it upon us.

Hence he is called the everlasting Father, Isa. 9.6. and metonymicaly Life it
self, Ioh. 14.6.

II. Good works are not the meritorious cause of life eternal; although life is
promised to them as a free reward.

A reward is promised to good works, not as a due debt, but as a free gift; not
that by them we can merit life, but that we may be provoked to do them.

III. That eternal happiness consists in our freedom from all evil; in the
variety, magnitude, and eternity of joys.

Rev. 21.4. And God will wipe all tears from their eyes* and there shall be no
more death, nor sorrow, nor crying, nor shall there be any more pain; for the
first things are past.

IV. The variety of joys, is considered in the glorification of man, in the
delights of Heavenly mansions, in the blessed society of the Saints; but
chiefly in the union with God.

V. There shall be a glorification both of body and of soul.

VI. In the body shall be, 1 Clarity, 2. Impassibility, 3. Subtilty, 4. Agility.

VII. The soul shall be far more perfect than it was in the state of innocence;
for in it shall be understanding without error, light without darkness, wisdom
without ignorance reoson without obscurity, memory without oblivion; the will
also shall be without perverseness, joy without sorrow, pleasure without pain.
In the state of innocence, there was in Man a possibility not to sin; in the
state of glory, there shall be no possibility to sin.

VIII. The beauty of ^eavenly mansions, was shaddowed by the type of Solomon's
Temple, and Jerusalem.

^sal. 84 1 etc Rev 21. and 22.

IX. The communion of Saints, which be with joy, is expressed by the similitude
of a feast.

Matthew 22 2 etc.

X. Neither shall we have communion only with the ^ngels, but we shall be also
like the Angels.

Ma^th. 22.30 (...). Luke 20.36.

XI There shall be such a communion with God, that we shall see him without end,
love him without tediousness, and praise him without wearisomnesse.

XII. So great shall be that joy, that neither our tongues can express it, nor
our minds conceive it.

For in this life, neither had the eye seen nor ear heard, nor mind conceived,
that which can equal that glory, 1. Cor. 2 9.

XIII. Neither shall any bounds be set to this happiness, nor shall we ever
fall from it, but it shall continue for ever.

Psalm. 16.11. Thou shall show me the path of life, for in thy presence is
fullness of joy, and at thy right hand are pleasures for evermore.

XIV. There shall be degrees of eternal happiness.

This is gathered from Daniel, cap. 22. v. 3 They that be wise shall shine as
the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as
the Stars for ever and ever. Neither is this opinion overthrown by that place
of Matthew. 13. v. 43. whereas the just in general, are said to shine as the Sun:
for though the glory of the Elect being considered in themselves, is likened to
the brightness of Sun and Stars; yet in Daniel c. 12. this is promised to
Doctors above other men; neither can any other reason be given, why there
mention is made chiefly of them that instruct others: that place, 1 Co. 15.39,
40, 41 is alleged but to little purpose for proof of this: for the simile
concerning the diversity of brightness in the Stars does not prove the degrees
of future glory, but the ^ifference only that is b^twixt a mort^l an^ a
glorified body; as it appea^s by what follows. In the mean while we a^low not
that manner of different glory which the Papists teach; to wit, diversity of
merits. For as the gift of Faith and Sanct^fication, ac^ording to Gods mere
grace is unequally distributed to the Saints; so he will according to his
gracious pleasure impa^t glory; but so, that no man shall have cause to complain
of any want of glory in himself, or why he should envy it in another.

The SECOND. BOOK. Concerning the WORSHIP of GOD.
CHAP. I. Of the Nature of good Works.
IN the former Book we have spoken of the Knowledge of God; now we are to speak
of his Worship.

The true worship of God, consists in true holiness, and righteousness, or in
the study of good works, which good works are performed by the grace of the
Holy Spirit, out of true Faith, according as the Law requires, to the glory of
God, the certainty of our salvation, and edification of our neighbor.

The RULE
I. Good works are called Virtues.

But we take this word virtue in a larger sense* than it is taken by
Philosophers: for here we call virtues holy affections, holy thoughts and
actions.

II The same Synecdochically, are called by the name of Charity.

For so Christ says, that the whole Law consists in the precept of love
toward God and our neighbor: whereas love toward God, belongs to the first
Commandment; but love to our neighbor, to the second Table.

III The principal efficient cause of good works; is the Holy Ghost in respect
of beginning, continuation, and perfection.

For it belongs to the same power, to begin in us a good work, and to perfect
it, Phil. 1.6 as also, to give both to will, and to be able, or to do, cap.
2.31.

IV Their instrumental cause is Faith, the root of good works.

Romans 14.^3 what is not done of faith, is sin.

V. The matter of good works, are the affections and actions of a regenerate
man.

VI. The form of them is their agreement with the precept of the Decalogue.

For sin is a transgression of the Law, 1 John 3.4. that must needs be sin,
which deviates from the Law.

VII. Therefore those are not good works, which are conformable te the
commandments of men, and not of God.

Isa. 29.13. Matthew. 15 9. In vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines
the commandments of men.

VIII. Neither are those good works, which the Papists call works of
Supererogation, by which they say more is performed than by the Law is required.

IX This opinion is grounded upon their conceit of Councels or things not
commanded, but left to our liberty; the omission of which is not punishable,
but the performance is greater than legal obedience, and therefore meritorious.

They say, such Councels may be seen, Mat. 19. v. 11. where they teach, that
the counsel of single life is not contained within the command, and. ver. 21.
where they say, that to the young man a-counsel was given, not a command, that
he should sell his goods, and give them to the poor, and then follow Christ:
and 1 Cor 7. where they say, that the single life is counseled.

But this opinion of Councels, and works of supererogation is false. 1. Because
so the Law is made imperfect, whilst the performing of councels is preferred to
the fulfilling of the Law. 2* Because if no man is able to fulfill the Law,
much less able is any man to fulfill that which is heavier than the Law. 3.
Because to beg daily for pardon of our sins, and to brag of such works, are
things inconsistent.

The places above alleged are to be understood of commands and not of
Councels, which do not oblige men; these commands indeed are particular, and
given only to certain men according to the exigence of their condition and
gifts; yet they are subordinate to general precepts. Matthew. 29.11. Single life
is not only counseled, but commanded; two conditions being required. 1. If the
kingdom of Heaven does so require it. 2. If any be assured that he has the
gift of continency, so ver. 2.1. It is not a counsel, but a command that is
given to the young man, that his hypocrisy might be unmasked, who bragged that
he was able to fulfill all the Law. And 1 Cor. 7. Celibate is enjoined to them
that have the gift of continency, not simply, but because it was expedient for
the difficulty of those times. Now I pray, what is more consonant to Gods Law,
than to renounce all earthly things for the glory of God, therefore in these
places nothing is counseled, but what by the Law is commanded.

X. The end of good works is threefold, to wit, the glorifying of God, and the
testifying of our gratitude toward him; the certainty of salvation; and our
Neighbors edification.

We are taught, Matthew. 5.16. that we must study to do good works, both for Gods
cause and our Neighbors: Let your light ^o shine before men, that they may see
your good works, and glorify your Father which is in Heaven. They are to be
performed for our own sakes; because we can have no assurance of salvation,
election, vocation, and justification, but by good works, as the effects of
Faith, ^ustification and Sanctification: whence John says, He that does well
is of God. 1 Ep. 3. v. 10.

XI. The subject of good works, is man regenerated.

This was proved in the former Book, cap. 10. out of our natural corrupt on;
whence appears the vanity of the School-nens Doctrine, concerning merit of
congruity and condignity, they ascribe that to the works of an unregene^at man
before the first grace, but this to his works done after the first grace is
received: I hat they call the merit of congruity, because it is fit or
congruous that reward begiven to him that works virtuously this they call
merit of condignity, because there is a proportion between the merit and the
reward, of which opinion Bellarmine and Stapleton were ashamed.

XII. The adjuncts of good works are, their imperfection, and their necessity
nevertheless.

XIII. The good works of the Saints are imperfect, while they are travelers
here; but they shall be perfect in the state of glory hereafter.

This Doctrine is not thwarted by those places i^ which the Saints are said, To
walk perfectly, and not to turn toward the right hand, or to the left hand:
For in those places is understood not so much perfection it self, as the desire
of it, and the perfection of parts rather than of degrees; or their sincerity
and integrity are meant, whereby the faithful (though the Scripture elsewhere
speaks of their sins) study to serve God in the simplicity of their heart,
without hypocrisy.

XIV. Yet this imperfection is covered with Christ's perfection; hence our half
perfect works, and which are joined with infirmities, are reputed for perfect;
in this respect the Church is said to be without spot or wrinckle.

XV. Good works are necessary, by the necessity of precept and of the means,
but not by the necessity of the cause or merit.

By the necessity of precept they are necessary, because the study of good
works through all the Scriptures is most severely enjoined to us: They are
necessary in regard of the means, because they are sure marks of Vocation,
Election, and true Faith; and because they are the way and means to attain
heavenly bliss: As if a man should make a journey from York to London, to
obtain an inheritance, the way or journey is the medium or means, but not the
meriting cause or the inheritance; even so it is in this matter. Works would be
truly meritorious, if they had these three conditions, as expressed in the
following distich: Da tua, 1 sed quae non 2 debes; propo^tio 3 and adsit

Non aliter meritum di^eris esse tuum.

1. If they were our own. 2. If they were not due. 3. If they were
proportionable to l^fe eternal; But in our good works these conditions are
wanting, 1. Though good works be done by us, yet they are not of us, 2 Cor.
3.5. 2 We are bound to do them, so that is we should do all, yet we must
confess, We are unprofitable servants, Luke 17.10. 3. They have no proportion*
if they be compared to life eternal.

CHAP. II. Of Virtues and Works pertaining to the whole worship of God, and to
the Decalogue.
Virtue or good works, are either general or particular. Those, belong to the
whole worship of God, and so to the whole Law: these, to either of the Tables,
or to each Command:

The virtues of the first Command, are either of the Understanding, or of the
Will.

The virtues of the Understanding* are Wisdom and Prudence.

Wisdom is that virtue, by which we know Gods will, and our own infirmity;
that we may do what is conformable to Gods will, and may seriously beseech God
for strength to perform this will.

Romans 12.2. That you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect
will of God, Psalm. 143.10. Teach me to do thy will, because thou art my God,
lead me by thy good Spirit, through the right path.

To this is opposite foolishness, or ignorance of Gods ways, or an opinion of
wisdom.

Ier. 5.4. These are foolish for they know not the ways of the Lord, nor the
judgments of their God. Prove. 3.7, Be not wise in thy own conceit. Eccl. 7.16.
Be not too wise.

Prudence is a virtue, whereby we foresee how things are to be done in respect
of time, place, and manner, and what will be the event of each business which
is undertaken

The RULES.
I. Prudence is the director or guide of our counsels and actions.

II. It is prudence, to distrust the World, and not rashly to believe every man.

Ier. 9.4. Let every one take heed of his friend. Matthew. 10.10. be wise as
Serpents, and inocent in Doves.

III It is prudence to counterfeit, and to dissemble,

Yet here we must know, how and for what end we may counterfeit and dissemble:
the end is, either the edification of the Church of the godly; or the trial of
things needful, or the avoiding of dangers, or the desire of eschewing
vainglory or boasting Then it will be lawful to do this, when it can be done
without prejudice to Gods glory, to the truth to charity, to justice, to our
calling and duty, and without fraud.

IV. It is prudence in the evils of sin to choose none, in the evils of
punishment to choose the lesser.

So David, of the three punishments proposed to him, he chose the Pestilence
rather than War and Famine, 2 Samuel 24.12. Cyprian being willed by the Governor
to advise with himself, whether he would obey, or die? He answered, that in a
matter of such holiness, no advise was to be used. When the French King Charles
9. had proposed three things, to the Prince of Conde; the Mass, Death, and
perpetual Imprisonment: his answer was, that by Gods assistance he would never
choose the first; as for the other two, he left them to the Kings own pleasure.

To Prudence is opposite Imprudence Craft, and a conceit of Prudence.

Matthew. 25.3. But those that were foolish, took their Lamps, but did not take
oil with them. Luke 16.8. And the Lord commended the unjust Steward, that he
had done wise^y: where craft is called prudence abusively. Romans 12.16. Be not
wise in your own conceits.

So much of the Virtues of the mind: The virtues of the will in general are,
Integrity, Readiness, and Constancy.

Integrity is, whereby we perform obedience to God, although imperfect, yet
with a serious purpose, and without hypocrisy, as in the sight of God.

Deuteronomy. 18.13. Thou shall be perfect (or sincere) with the Lord thy God. 2 Cor.
1.12. For this is our boasting, even the testimony of our conscience.

To this is opposite the contempt of Conscience, or a dissembling and
hypocritical Conscience.

1 Timothy 1.19, 20. Retaining faith and a good conscience, which some having put
away, concerning faith have made shipwreck, of whom are Hymeneus and Alexander.
Joh. 18.28. The Priests went not into the Iudgment-hall, lest they should be
defiled, but that they might eat, etc.

Readiness or promptitude called also chearfullnesse and alacrity, is a virtue
whereby we obey God freely, joyfully.

Psalm. 40.9. I delight to do thy will, O my God. Psalm. 110.3. thy people shall
be willing. 2 Cor. 9. ver. 7. God loves a cheerful giver.

To this is oppsite Precipitancie and Coaction.

Matthew. 8.19. And a certain Scribe came and said unto him Master, I will follow
thee whithersoever thou go. 2 Cor. 9 ver. 7. Every man, as he is purposed in
his heart, so let him give, not grudgingly or of necessity.

Constancy is a virtue, whereby man is prepared to persevere to the end in the
knowledge, profession, and worship of God.

Matthew. 24.13. But he that continues to the end, shall be saved: see the
examples of Prophets, Apostles, and Martyrs, etc.

To this is opposite, Inconstancy, or pertinacy in an error or evil purpose.

Luke 9.62. No man that puts his hand to the plough, and looking back, is
meet for the Kingdom of God. Act. 7.51. Stiff-necked and uncircumcised in
heart, etc.

CHAP. III. Of Virtues or Works belonging to the First Commandment.
SO much of the general Virtues or Works: the special, belong to the immediate,
or mediate worship of God.

Gods immediate worship, is that which is performed to him immediately, and is
taught in the first Table.

This is either internal only, or else external, and internal both.

The internal worship only, is that which resides in the heart, and is enjoined
in the first Precept.

The sum whereof is, that we worship and know him alone for the true God.

For the precept is negative, Thou shall have no other Gods but me: from this
is gathered an affirmative, Know and worship me alone for God.

Therefore to this precept belongs the knowledge of God, and a religious
affection toward him.

The knowledge of God is, whereby we acknowledge him to be the only true God, as
he reveals himself to us in Scripture: Deuteronomy. 6.4. Hear ^ Israel, the Lord our
God is one God, Isa. 46.9. Have not I told you from that time, and have
declared it? etc. Is there a God besides me? Yea, there is no God, I know not
any.

Contrary to this is Atheism, and multiplicity of gods or Polytheisme.

Psalm. 14.1. The fool has said in his heart, there is no God. Gal. 4.8. Even
then when you knew not God, you served them which by nature were not gods.

Religious affection toward God, consists in Faith, Hope, Charity,
Confidence in God, Fear, Repentance, Patience, and Thankfulness of mind.

For to acknowledge any for God, is to believe, to place trust and confidence
in him, to love and fear him above all things, to submit patiently to his will,
and to acknowledge all good things for his gift*

Faith is, whereby we lay hold on God, as our God and Father, and firmly
believe his Word, Promises, and Threaatnings.

We considered Faith before as the instrument of Justification and
Sanctification but here, as a virtue and internal work of God in reference to
his worship.

To Faith is opopsite (...) or Infidelity, and doubting of the goodness and
power of God; as also the presumption of Faith, Psalm. 78.22. The Israelites
believed not, nor ^r^sted in his salvation. Number. 20.12. Because ye did not
believe me, that ye might sanctify me, etc Jam. 2.14. what avails it, my
brethren, if any man say, he has faith, and have not works? Can his faith save
him?

Confidence is a virtue, whereby we ^est in God and in his promises, and
totally depend on him in all things both corporal and spiritual.

We have already spoken of confidence, as it is the form of Faith, and applies
to the heart the Promises concerning Christ: Here it is considered, as the
effect of Faith. Of this, Solomon says; Trust in the Lord with all thy heart,
Prove. 3.5.

Contrary to this, is distrust in God, and trust or confidence in Idols.

An example of dis^rust, is in the Israelites: Psalm. 78.19, 20. in David, 1.
Sam. 27.1: in the kings Captain. 2. King. 6 35; in Aha^, Isa. 7.12. in those
that are too careful what they shall eat Matthew. 6.25. Idol^^rous confidence is
that which man puts in the Devil, as witches do^ or in Idols as A. hazia, 2.
king. 1.2. or in men's inventions, as Papists, or in the arm of flesh, Ier.
17.5. or in covenantes, Fotifications, Physic etc, as Asa, who implored the
help of the Syrians, and consulted with Physicians, not with God; 2 Chronicles.
16.7. and 12. Yet it is lawful to make use of outward helps and aid, so we
place not confidence in them; we must use them as servants, not trust in them
as gods.

Hope is that, whereby we expect undoubtedly Gods future favors, especially
the accomplishment of our salvation relying on Gods promises, and Christ's
merits.

Hope differs from faith, as the effect from the cause: for the object of
faith, is the promise on which faith relies; the object of hope, is the thing
promised, which hope expects.

Contrary to these are doubting, desperation and idolatrous hope.

Sometimes the godly fall into doubting, 1 Samuel 27, 1. David said in his heart,
I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul. But the wicked only fall into
a total and final desperation: so did Cain, Genesis 4. Saul, 1 Samuel 28. and 31
Achitophel, 2 Samuel 17. Judas, Matthew. 27 and such like; Idolatrous hope is in
Papists, who call the Wooden Cross, Mary, etc. their hope; and expect life
eternal for their merits, satisfactions, and indulgences.

Charity is that, whereby God is loved sincerely, and above all things else, as
the chief good.

For so it is commanded, Deuteronomy. 6.5. Mat. 22.37

Contrary to this, is the hatred of God and idolatrous love; whereby the World
and the things therein, are loved more than God.

Joh. 15.24. They have hated both me and my Father. 1. Joh. 2.15. If any man
love the World, the love of the Father is not in him.

The fear of God is, whereby we so reverence Gods word and majesty, that by all
means we are loath to offend so bountiful a Father, not so much out of the fear
of punishment, as the love of God.

The fear of God is sometimes taken for the whole worship of God; but here that
virtue is understood, which is called filial fear.

To these are opposite, carnal security, servile, and idolatrous fear.

The security of the godly differs far from that of the wicked: for in the
one, the fear of God is not lost; in the other the fear of God is not found.
Servile fear differs from filial: 1, Filial fear proceeds from the love of God;
but Servile, from the fear or hatred of God. 2. In filial we fear to offend
God, because he is a Father; in servile, we fear to be punished by him, because
he is a judge: 3. Filial, draws a man to God; servile, drives a man from God.
Idolatrous fear is, when one is more afraid of men and the world, than of God,
Matt 10.28. Fear not them that can kill the body.

Repentance is, whereby we acknowledge our sins, and bewail them being
acknowledged; and with all cheer up our selves in the assurance of Gods mercy
through Christ's merits, and resolve to obey God, and to refrain from sin.

We have showed in the former Book, Cap. 31. how Penitence, and Resipiscence
d^ffer: now this word resipiscence, is taken either for the whole change of
man, or special vocation; or else for sanctification, or for the effect of
sanctification, and part of Gods internal worship; in the ^hird signification
it is here considered.

There are three parts thereof, 1. Contrition, 2. Confidence, 3. Purpose of
amendment.

To this is opposite perseverance and induration in sin; as likewise feigned
and idolatrous repentance.

An example of feigned repentance is in Ahab, 1 King. 21. Idolatrous repentance
is that of the Papists which they place, 1, In contrition, 2. In confession, 3.
In satisfaction; and by which they think their sins are expiated: but these
th^ee were in Judas his repentance* Matthew. 27.

Gratitude toward God, is whereby we humbly acknowledge his goodness and
blessings bestowed upon us undeservedly, withal purposing to glorify him
seriously.

Genesis 32.10. I am unworthy of the least of thy mercies, says Jacob.

To this is contraty, (...) or ingratitude toward God, when we show no
thankfulness to him, or when we ascribe Gods bounties either to our selves, or
to the creatures, or to Idols.

Isa. 1.2. I have nourished and brought up Children, and they have rebelled
against me. Ier. 44.27 By burning incens to the queen of Heaven, and putting
drink offerings to her, etc. We had plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw
no evil. Hab. 1.16. The wicked sacrifices to his own nets, and offers
incense to his own drag, etc.

Patience is that, whereby we are sustained in the faith of Gods Providence,
power, and bounty; and when he visites us with afflictions, we submit our
selves with humility to his correction.

There be diverse kinds of affl^ctions for the exercising of our patience; for
besides the vengeance that God does pour out on the wicked; the affliction of
Gods children is either chastisement, or trial, or lastly martyrdom, bloody
and unbloody.

To patience are opposite impatience, hypocritical patience, and (...) Stoical
Apathie or want of passion.

To impatience belongs complaining or grumbling in affliction, as if they were
undeserved; and softness. Hypocritical patience is perceived in them who
torture themselves, as the Priests of Baal did, 1 King. 18 28. The Eremites,
the Whippers, etc The Stoical Apathie is rejected, because patience can well
consist with the sense of pains, with mourning and complaints; if so be we do
not murmr against God, and that our complaints be rather for our sins than
for our sufferings.

CHAP. IV. Of virtues and Works belonging in general to the II.III. and IV.
Commandments.
WE have spoken of Gods internal worship; Now follows that worship which is
partly internal, partly external; which is usually called the true Religion,
and is commanded in the three following Precepts.

True Religion is, whereby God is worshipped by Rites and Ceremonies prescribed
by himself; and his Name truly sanctified both through the whole course of our
ilfe, and chiefly at the times by himself appointed.

The RULES.
I. Religion and piety, called by the Greeks the Worship and service of God: in
general, it signifies the whole worship of God, in special, the immediate
Worship; but most specially, either the internal alone, or the internal and
external together.

II. This is called in Scripture, Dulia and Latria.

The Pontificians ascribe Dulia to Angels and Men, Latria to God, Hyperdulia to
Mary. But this is without, yea, against Scripture: for Matt. 4.10. Latria is
given to him; and Matt. 6.24. Dulia, to him alone.

III. True Religion is divine, in its Original, Matter, Form, and End.

IV. True Religion is but only one.

For that religion is only true, which agrees with Gods word; for verity and
unity are convertible.

V. Religion should be cared for by all, chiefly by Magistrates and Ministers.

For they are the Churches nursing Fathers, by preserving Schools and Churches,
and by maintaining of Ministers, etc.

VI. The true Religion is most ancient, for it began in Paradise.

VII. It is not only external, but internal also.

Romans 2.28. etc For he is not a Jew that is one outwardly, neither is that
Circumcision which is outward in the flesh, but he is a Jew which is one
outwardly, and Circumcision is that of the heart.

VIII. A.R. Religion is to be taught, not to be forced.] The reasons are, 1.
Because Faith comes by hearing, says the Apostle: But the acts of hearing,
reading, meditating praying by which Religion is both begot and nourished, are
voluntary. 2. The proper seat of Religion is the will; but the will cannot be
forced. 3. In propogating of Religion, we must imitate God in our conversion,
who uses not to force us; but gently to persuade, incline and move us. 4. No
force or violence has any continuance; neither has forced Religion. 5.
Religion is the free gift of God, which as it is freely given, so it must be
freely received without constraint. 6. As ^e is not to be esteemed an Heretic,
or an Idolater, that is forced thereto; neither is he Religious, that is
compelled to embrace it. 7, Christ and his Apostles never used any force in
propagating of Religion* not the Sword, but the Word was the instrument used to
propagate Christianity. 8. Christ is so far from using violence, that he will
rather suffer the tares to grow with the good corn, than pluck them by force.
9. We find, that violence is rather a hinderer than a furtherer of Religion;
for the more men are persecuted for their conscience, the more eager they are
to hold it: The stronger the wind blows, so much the faster does the Traveller
hold his Cloak. The blood of Martyrs had evermore been the seed of the Church,
10. The forcing of religion has been the cause of much mischief, murders,
disorders, and changes in states: therefore the wise Romans permitted the Jews,
after they were subdued, to use freely their own Religion; neither did they
force any of their conquered Nations to accept the Roman Religion. 11. Where
violence is used, there can be no justice. 12. Nor God: for he is neither to be
found in earthquakes, whirl-winds, and fire, but in the soft and still voice.
13. The forcing of religion, is the maintaining of hypocrisy; for all such are
hypocrites, who are forced to profess outwardly what inwardly they hate. 14.
The forcing of religion is the undoing of Religion; for its most dangerous
Enemies are the secret Enemies that lurk in the bosom of the Church, they will
kiss Religion with the mouth* and in the interim stab it with their hidden
knife. 15. Faith in the gift of God, being a theological virtue infused, not
acquired: if it be not then in our own power to believe, till it be given us
from above, how can it be in the power of any other to make us believe? how can
they force as to take that which is not given? to profess that which we have
not received?
Religion is to be taught, not to be forced.

IX. Religion may be defended by arms but not propagated by arms

Examples of pious Kings, the Macchbees, Emperors, as Constantine and
Theodosius, show this.

X. Reformation of things amiss in Religion, belong to the prince or Magistrate.

After the examples of Moses, Joshua, David, Asa, Iehosaphat, Hezekiah, Josiah,
Constantine, Theodosius, etc.

XI. If a Magistrate proves the Churches enemy, and will not be entreated to
give way for a Reformation; then it li^s upon them to reform, whom God has
furnished with necessary gifts for that purpose, neither in such a case must we
stay for consent of Church or Bishops.

Examples are in Gideon, Jehojadah, Macchabees, Apostles, etc. Sure if our
Predecessors had stayed for the Popes consent, there had never been a
Reformation.

Contrary to true Religion, are Epicurisme and false Religions.

CHAP. V. Of Virtues and Works belonging in special to the Second Commandment.
IN true Religion, we must consider its parts, and time, appointed by God.

The parts are two: to wit, the form or rite whereby God will be worshipped in
his Church: and the Sanctification of his Name, all the rest of our life

The form of his worship, is that which he has prescribed to us in his Word,
which is handled in the Second Precept; the sum whereof is this: That God
should be worshipped in such manner, as he has prescribed to his Church.

This appears by the right Analysis of the second Command, which is foolishly
confounded with the first: For as in the first Command is set down, who must be
worshipped for God; so in the second is showed after what manner he will be
worshipped. And as in the first, internal idolatry is contrary; so in the
Second, external is opposed to this worship The parts of this Command are two;
a Prohibition and a Confirmation. Of the Prohibition there are two branches:
the first is, of the making; the second of the worshipping of Idols. Of the
making he says, Thou shall not make to thy self any graven image, or likeness,
etc. which he illustrates by enumeration of particulars following, to wit, of
any things in Heaven above, or in the earth beneath, or in the waters under the
earth. The veneration of idols is declared two-wayes: 1* by bowing to them, 2.
by worshipping of them The Confirmation contains a threatening, and a promise;
both are illustrated from the nature of God, and from the object: In the one he
describes himself to be a jealous God visiting iniquities etc. In the other
merciful. In the one, he denounces punishment to the third and fourth
generation of them that hate him; but in the other, his mercy of the thousand
generation of them that love him. It is easy then to see what is the sum of
this precept, by the proceeding thereof, 1. From the particular to the general;
for Idolatry is forbid, with all such rites as are either contrary to, or not
contained in the Word of God. 2. From the negation to the affirmation of the
contrary: for it is commanded that we worship God in that way which he has
prescribed to us.

In the rites prescribed to the Church we must observe both the helps and parts
thereof.

The parts are, the right use of the Word and Sacraments and Prayer.

The right use or handling of the Word and Sacraments is, when the one is
preached, the other administered according to Christ's institution.

Prayer is, whereby we speak to God in the true and humble contrition of heart,
of such things as are agreeable to his holy will. This consists in calling
upon God, or in giving of thanks.

The RULES.
I. The common efficient cause of Prayer, is the whole Trinity, but in
particular, the Holy Ghost.

Whence he is called the spirit of Prayers, Zach. 12.10.

II. The impulsive cause on Gods part, are his command Psalm. 27.8. and.50.15.
Isa. 55 6. Joh. 16.24.
, Promise of being heard Mat. 7.7. 1 Timothy 2.1. Jam. 5.13. Isa. 65.24. and other
places now alleged.
his majesty 2 King. 19.15.
, his goodness Ps* 86.4.5.
, his benefits Ps. 34.5. and 103.2. etc.
, But on our part, is our need; which is gathered by the consideration of our
wants, calamities, tentation, and dangers, etc.

III. The matter of Prayer, are things obtained, and to be obtained,

IV. The form or Idea of true and religious Prayer, is the Lords Prayer.

The parts of this are four; the Preface the Pet^tions, the Confirmat^on, and
Conclusion: The Pr^face is this, Our Father which art in heaven. Set down to
this end that ou^ minds may be disposed, 1. To docility; for it shows who is to
be invoked* to wit, that God who in Christ is made ou^ Father by adopting us
for his sons. 2. To humility; because he is not an earthly, but an heavenly
Father. 3. To assure us we shall be heard; For he will hear us; because he is
our Father; and can hear us, because he is in Heaven. 4. To charity because we
are taught to say, Our Father. Of the Petitions there be two ranks: the first
is, of them that concerns Gods glory, the first and chief whereof is, Hallowed
be thy Name; to this the two latter is subordinate, Thy kingdom come, thy will
be done on earth as it is in Heaven. The latter rank is of those Petitions
which concern our needs, as well for this as for the next life: For the
present, belongs the fourth Petition, Give us this day our daily bread: For the
future, the two latter; And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that
trespass against us; And lead us not into tentation, but deliver us from evil.
That has reference to the gift of justification, this, of Sanctification. The
Confirmation follows in these words: For thine is the K^ngdome, the Power, and
the glory, for ever and ever. By which we are taught 1. That God likes our
Prayers, because he is our King, for his is the Kingdom. 2. That he can hear
us, for his is the Power. 3. That he will hear us for his is the glory. 4. That
his love toward us is unchangable for he is so for ever and ever. The
conclusion is in the particle Amen; by which we witness that we have prayed
seriously, and with confidence to be heard.

V. The end of prayer is Gods glory, and our salvation.

For this is the Alpha and Omega of Prayer: hence the Petitions of the Lords
Prayer begin with Gods glory, and end in our salvation.

VI. Great are the effects of prayer: not as if there were merit in it for the
wor^ wrought, the force is in Gods promise, rather than in the prayer.

VII. The Object to which prayer is directed, is the whole Trinity; yet so,
that (...) the persons conjunctly, or either of them s^^verally is called upon.

That the Father is to be called upon, is not doubted. The Son is called upon
by S^epher, Act 7.59. yea, all the Angels worship him, Heb, 1.6. The Holy Ghost
is called upon with the Father and Son by John. Rev. 1.^ 5. And that Angelic^
hymn, Holy, holy, ho^^ etc. Isa. 6.3. etc. applied to the Son, (...) 12.41.
and to the ho^ly Ghost, Act. 28.2^ 26, etc.

VIII. The object for which we pray, (...) the living, not the dead; and such
as sin, (...) not to death.

For God will not be entreated for those who sin unto death, 1 Ioh. 5 16. For
the dead we must not pray, because they are either damn^^ or blessed: if damne^
our p^ayers are fru^^les; if blessed, needles^

IX. The object against which we pray, are Gods open Enemies.

We ought not presently to pray for their eternal destruction: but we are to
bes^ech God that with his mighty hand he would humble and convert them;
otherwise eternally to plague them, if they will not be converted. The
imprecations of the Prophets are not to be imitated by us rashly; for it is
hard to discern those who sin to death, and those of whom we have good hope.

X. Prayers should be joined with an humble confession of our sins, with a true
and firm confidence, and a constant purpose of repentance.

XI. External gestures decently used, avail much both to excite and to testify
the devotion of our souls.

So much of the parts of that form, whereby God will be worshipped of us: the
outward helps follow, whereof are Fastings and Vows.

Fasting is an abstinence from meat and drink undertaken for a time, that the
lasciviousness of the flesh may be subdued, and God with the greater fervency
may be called upon.

The RULES.
I Fasting is either forced, or voluntary: That, is the poor man's, for want of
meat this of them who want not meat. The voluntary Fast is either Natural,
Civil, or Ecclesiastical; Natural, is that which is undertaken for healths
sake; the Civil, is that which is enjoined by the Magistrate in some public
affairs: Ecclesiastical, is that we define.

II. Ecclesiastical fasting, is private or public.

III. Private, is that which one injoyns to himself, or his family, for some
private causes.

Examples are, Job 1.5. 2 Samuel 3.35. and 12.16. Nehem. 1.4.

IV. Public, is that which is commanded by the Magistrate or the Church for
some public causes, especially, when calamities are at hand.

Examples, 2 Chronicles. 20. Hest. 4.

V. In a true Fast, the manner and end are to be considered.

VI. For the manner, true fasting, ^ Consists not in choice of meats, but in
abstinence from all meats: 2. Not in external abstinence from meat, but in
abstinence from sin

Isa. 58.6. etc. Joel. 2 12.

VII. There ought to be no other end of Fasting, but only to give our selves
more earnestly to prayer and divine worship, to beat down the lasciviousness
of the flesh, to witness our humility before God, and our repentance before
our neighbor.

VIII. Fasting is not tied to certain times, as in the Old Testament; but
ought to be undertaken freely upon urgent causes and necessity.

So much for Fasting. A Vow is a promise made in a holy manner to God, of
things lawful, to witness our readiness to serve God.

The RULES.
I. A Vow in this place signifies a religious promise; not prayers or desires.

II. A Vow is either general, or particular? That, is of things commanded, and
is required of all men* such is the Vow of Baptism: this, is of things lawful,
and is undertaken for some private cause: that, is a part of divine Worship;
this, is only a help thereto.

III. A particular Vow is considered in its efficient matter, form, and end.

IV. For the efficient, they are excluded from making a vow, who want as yet
the use of judgment and reason: 2. Who are not Masters of themselves, but are
either subject to Parents, or Husband.

Numb 6.

V. The matter of a Vow, is a thing lawful, and in our power.

VI. The form consists in the deliberation of the mind, in purpose of the
will, and in the promise either internal or external also.

VII. The end is, to testify thankfulness of mind, or to exercise some
private discipline.

A Vow of the first kind is, when one that has escaped a sickness or danger,
does consecrate to God something by Vow as a token of his gratitude: A Vow of
the latter sort is, when one by Vow abstains from something in it self lawful,
yet dangerous to him, as Wine, etc.

VIII. The subject to whom we ought to Vow, is God only.

IX. A Vow before it is made is arbitrary; but being lawfully made, it is to be
kept, Psalm. 76.12. Vow and pay unto the Lord your God.

Hitherto of the true manner of worshipping God, to which are contrary the
intermission of it, and falls worship. And this is threefold in respect of the
object, for either it is not commanded by God, or else it is expressly
prohibited by him; or being commanded, is directed to some other end.

The manner of worshipping of God not commanded, is called Will Worship, to wit,
a worship devised by man's brain

Paul opposes this kind of worshipping God to Christian Liberty, Col 2.20.21,
22, 23. Therefore if you be dead with Christ, you are freed from the ru^diments
of this world: Why, as though living in the World, are you subject to
ordinances? (touch not, taste not, handle not which all are to perish; with
using) after the commandments and doctrines of men? which things have indeed a
show of wisdom in wil-worsh^p and humili^y, and n^glecting of the body, not in
any honor to the satisfying of the flesh. Such are those ceremonies-brought in
by Pope^y in Baptism, etc and their five Sacraments by them devised, canonical
hours, beads, and the Latin tongue in Prayer; Fasts placed rather in choice of
meats, than in abst^nence, chiefly Le^ fast, the Vows also of poverty, Monkish
obedience, and Religious continency. The Vow of poverty is impious; for whereas
man by Gods command should eat his b^ead in the sweat of his face by such
voluntary poverty, this command is slighted* No better is the Vow of
obedience; for by it, man who is redeemed by the precious blood of Christ, is
made a slave to money, and is drawn off from his lawful calling. As for the Vow
of Continency; it is rash, for it is a rare gift; and by th^s Vow, many under
pretense of chastity are entangled in the sna^es of Satan.

The manner of Religious worship forbid by Gods Word, is idolatry, and worship
of Saints. Idolatry, is, whereby an Idol is made, kept and religiously
worshipped.

There be two kinds of Idolatry: one is, when that which is not God, is
accounted and worshipped for God; and this is contrary to the first Precept:
the second kind is when the true God indeed i^ worshipped; but either in
Idols, or in Saints, Angels, or dead Men.

An Idol is an Image, Picture, or Statue, made for Religious Worship.

The RULES.
I A. R. An Idol differs from an image or similitude as the species from the
genus, tho the Church has appropriated the word Idol to the Heathen
superstitious images; so that every idol is an im^ge, but not every image an
idol yet in truth (...) and ^mago are the same; for (...), is from (...), the
species or form and shape of a thing, and this from (...), to see; whence comes
the word idea* which is the species of a thing in the mind or sense: so imago
is as much as imitago* or, eum ago, a^ imitation, representation or acting of
any thing; whence comes the word imaginatio, which is all one with idea:
herefore (...) in Homer is exp^essed by imago in Virgil, as Aen. 2. nota major
imago Aen. 4. Magna mei sub terras ibit i^ag^: and indeed these words imago,
simulachrum, ^mb^a, effigies, are taken indifferently one for another in Latin
Authors: yet in scripture, we find a great difference; for (...), or imago
stands in opposition to (...) or umbra. Heb. 10 1. the Law has the shadow of
good things to come, and not the very image of the things: where image is taken
for the reality and truth of the things* but shadow, for the appea^ance only
and show. Hence Christ is c^lled the image of the Father; not his shadow,
p^cture, or idol. Rupertus makes some d^fference between image and similitude,
or likeness; in saying, that Christ is the image of the Father, and the Holy
Ghost his similitude: because God says, Let us make man in our image, after
our likeness; Rupert. l. 2. de Trinit c 2. But this is a nicity. For indeed,
the word image and likeness there sign^ fieth the same thing, the one word
being used to explain the other.
An Idol differs from an image or similitude, as the species from the genus.

The Papists in this err doubly* 1. They will have an Idol, and image or
similitude, to be the same, their reasons this: because ^imulaechrum in Latin,
is, say they derived a simulando, but it should be rather a similando, from
likeness, but an Idol is not the same that an image, for man is Gods image;
(which Tertullian calls Simulachrum) but he is not Gods Idol* in vain do they
alledg the Greek word (...), which say they, the Latin translates simulachrum
always: for even in the Latin Bible we have testimonies to the contrary,
Exodus 34.15. Levit. 26.30. Act. 17, 23. Secondly, they say, that images are of
things existent, but idols of things not existent: but we know that the
Gentiles had idols not only of things feigned, but also of things truly
existing; nor will Paul's phrase help them, 1 Cor. 8.4. We know that an idol is
nothing in the world: for this is not spoken with reference to the object which
is represented by the idol, but in respect of the virtue and efficacy of idols,
which indeed is none.

II. The degrees of Idolatry are, the making, the keeping, and worshipping of
them.

III. The making of an Idol is, when an Image is made for religious ends.

IV. But every making of an Image is not Idolatrous: for such may be made for
memory, delight, or other civil ends.

V The Cherubins, Brazen Serpent and such like, were made by Gods appointment
not for religious worship, but to be types of Christ.

In vain therefore do Papists defend their idols under such preten^es: For, 1.
God commanded the making of them, He forbids the making of these. 2. No
rel^gious worship must be given to them: therefore as soon as the braz^n
Serpent began to be worshipped, it was broken in pieces, 2 king 18.4 But these
are rel^giously adored. 3. Whereas all types by Christ's coming are abolished,
such can have no place in the New Testament.

VI. The Images of Christ, of Angels, of Mary, and of the Saints, made by
Papists, are doubtless Idols.

The reason is because they are made for rel^gious worship. The Pap^sts deny
those to be (...). 1 Because they are not images o^ things not existent. 2
Because they are not acknowledged for God. 3. Because a humane face* and wings
a^e ascribed to Angels. 4 Because the Saints were truly men. 5. Because these
are Laymens Books* Answ. in the first and second Argument* there is no
consequence, because in both an image is falsely defined; for not only is that
an idol which is of a thing not existent, or which is acknowledged for God,
seeing the Gentiles had Idols of things which were truly existent, and they put
dfference between the Idols and the things themselves. 2 The Antecedent in both
is false, if simply understood, For it is certain that the ^aepists make images
of them that never were, as of Saint George, Christopher, and such like: it is
also certain that many do take these idols for God, seeing they bestow both
divine virtue, and divine honor on them. In the third also there is no
consequence from those lively images which God did exhibit in Visions, to dumb
Images. In the fourth, this only follows, that the images of the Saints may be
made so they be not made for Religious worship. In the fifth, the Antecedent is
false; for what kind of Books these are, may be seen in Ier. 10 14, 15. Hab:
12.18, 19. Where Idols are called the teachers of lying and vanity.

VIII To make the Image of the Trinity, is most horrible Idolatry.

The reasons are 1 Because God has forbid the making of such images, Deuteronomy.
4.15, etc 2. Because the Trinity cannot be presented by an image, as is
expressly showed Isa. 40.18. and 46.5. 3. Because it is a dishonor to the
Majesty of God; to represent him in the likeness of a man, in wood or stone;
Esa. 40.19.20. and ^6.6* Romans 1.23, etc. They object, 1 The images of the Holy
Trinity do not represent Gods essen^e, but only his properties and actions. 2.
Such images have been presented in Visions, therefore they are not idols. Answ.
In the first argument the Antecedent endeavors a false separation of the
Properties of God from his essence, whereas indeed they are his very Essence*
and the consequence is false; for he will not have himself, nor his actions, or
app^arances expressed by images, Deuteronomy. 4.15, etc. In the second, the Antecedent
is false; for the images that were presented to the holy men of God, were not
dumb and made with hands, but living, which notwithstanding they neither
painted nor carved.

VIII. As the making, so the keeping of Idols is condemned in Scripture.

Deuteronomy, 7.5. Thus shall ye do to them, ye shall overthrow their Altars, and
break down their Images, ye shall also cut down their Groves, and shall burn
their carved images with fire, Esa. 30 22. Ye shall defile the covering of thy
graven images of silver, and the ornaments of thy molten images of go^d, thou
shall cast them away as a menst^uous cloth, thou shall say unto it, get thee
hence. 2 Cor. 6 16. what agreement is their between the Temp^e of God and Idol?
See the example of Iehosapha^, Ezeckaiah, Iosia; etc. But our adversaries, on
the contrary reason thus. Who retain images in Temples for ornaments only, not
for worship, are not Idolaters; But we, etc. Answ. The proposition is false. 1.
Because though images be not worsh^pped, yet there is danger that they may be
worshipped. 2. Because that cannot be an ornament to the Temple, which is a
dishonor to God; this is a whorish ornament, and the badge of old fornication.
They object that the br^z^n Serpent was first worshipped, before it was broken.
Answ. There is great ods between the b^azen Serpent and Idols; for that was not
erected to be rel^giously worsh^pped, but to represent Christ; now as soon as
it was adored, it became an Idol; if then the retaining of the brazen Serpent
wanted not danger, how much es^ can these be without danger, which have truly
been, and are Idols.

IX. Id^latrous worship consists in adoration and service, Adoration is by
uncovering of the head, bowing of the body, bending of the knee, kissing, and
such like gestures. Religious service of Idols is, when they are trimmed up
with gold, silver and jewels; when incense is burned to them, and they are set
on high places; when Vows are made to them, when they are honored with
^ilgrimages, Gifts, Wax-candles, Tapers, Altars, Temples, Festivals, and other
such like Religious Ceremonies.

This worship is most severely forbid in this second Precept: Thou shall not
bow to them nor worship them; also, Deuteronomy. 4.15.16.17* Psalm. 115.2, etc. Hab.
2.19. 1 Cor. 10.14. 1 Ioh. 5. ver. last. Here the Papists say, 1. That these
places spoke only of the Gentile Idols. 2. That they worship not the Image, but
God in the Image, as it is in that verse, Nam Deus est, quod Imago docet, sed
non Deus ipse.
Hanc videas, sed mente colas quod cernis in ipsa.
It Is God which here is taught, but yet this Image is not he;
Look on the Image, and in it adore God mentalty.


To the first exception we answer, 1 That in the alleged places, chiefly in
this Command; and Deuteronomy. 4. all images made for Religious ends are condemned. 2.
The same reasons why the Gentile Idols (...) abominable belong also to Popish
images; for these also are of gold, silver, brass, wood, stone etc. Neith^r can
they see, nor hear, nor walk, Rev 9.20. To the latter exception we say, 1.
Images are truly worshipped in Popery; seeing there is no part of religious
worship expressed in this ninth Rule which they do not exhib^t to their images.
2. They are not excused, who pretend they worship God in the image, because he
has forbid such worship, and he will be worshipped in Spirit, Ioh. 4.23.
Otherwise by this reason the Israelites might have excused themselves; for they
were not so mad as to think a golden Calf to be their God, but they would
worship God in the Calf as in a symbol or sign.

X. The adoration of the consecrated Host is like the worshipping of Images.

The ground of this adoration is no less Idolatous; to wit, Christ's presence
in the bread or outward accidents thereof, by which they say bodily, that the
bread is deified or become God; as in that hymn Thou art not bread but thou art
he, who being God man saved me.

XI. And so is the adoration of the Image of the Cross.

For so they speak to it in their Anthems. All hail O Cross, our only hope,
increase righteousness in holy men, and pardon the guilty.

XII. No less idolatrous are those little Images which they call Agnus Dei
consecrated. in Popery and to which they ascribe the same power in cleansing of
sins, dispelling of lightning, etc. as to Christ

XIII. The Relics of Saints are honored in Popery with much imposture and
idolatry; for that they are supposititious, is plain by this, in that there is
no Saint who has not two or three bodies showed in diverse places among Papists.

See Calvin's Admonition of Relics.

Hitherto of Idolatry: the adoration of Saints, is a Religious worship or
prayer directed to Saints, Angels, and dead Men.

The RULES.
I There is a twofold adoration, Civil and Religious: that, is an outward and
Civil honor; this, a religious invo^ation.

II. We may lawfully adore, or civilly worship the Saints whilst they are
present.

Examples in Genesis 18. and 19, 1 king. 18.7. ^. king 2.15.

III. Yea the dead also which are in Heaven are to be honored, By thinking
reverently of them. By declaring their virtues, as the gifts of God. 3. By
imitating them.

Matthew. 26.13. Verily verily I say unto you, wheresoever this Gospel shall be
preached through the World, this also shall be spoken as a memorial of her.

IV. But neither Saint nor Angel must be adored or called upon religiously.

Because 1. for this we have neither precept, nor example, nor promise in
Scripture. 2. By invocating the Saints, we make them omniscient and omnipotent,
which are only Gods attributes 3. Because we must not believe in the Saints.
Now how shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? Romans 10 14. 4.
Because they refused religious worship by the example of Peter Act. 10.25, 26.
and of the Angel, R^v. 19.10. and 22.8. The objections of Papists are
^rivol^us, for that saying in Genesis 48.16. is to be understood not of a created,
but of an uncreated, Angel, to wit the Son of God, Genesis 48 16 For, Jacob's name
to be called upon by his sons, is to have their name from Jacob, and to be
received into the number of his posterity as Isa. 4 1. That place of Job. 5.1.
in the vulgar Latin is corrupted; For Eliphas there does nor exhort Job to
call upon the departed Saints, but he appeals to the testimone of the Saints
alive. Neither will it follow, that dead Saints must be called upon, because we
are commanded to have recourse to their Prayers, whilst they are alive, Iam.
5.14. For the condition of the Saints here and hereafter is not alike; because
in this life they know our wants, in the other they know not, I^a. 63.16. in
this life they are not invoked, but invited to pray for u^ but the departed
Saints are religiously called upon, and their help implored by Papists; the
ground of the Popish opinion is, that the Saints are mediators, at least of
intercession; but how false this is, we have showed, Lib. 1. c. 18.

So much of the form of Religious worship, as it is forbid by God. That form
which is commanded by God, but directed to another end, is either superstitious
or hypocritical.

Superstitious worship is, when a certain force and efficacy is ascribed to
external Rites commanded by God, as if it were for the work wrought.

As when force is attributed to certa^n words, voices, and writings to drive
away Satan to cure diseases, etc When they feign that there is in the
Sacraments a virtue by themselves to free (...) from sin, and to save us: When
they think by their babbling and multitude of words, and such l^ke to please God
when they judge one day, or one kind of meat holier than another, when they
think to merit by their Vows.

Hypocritical worship is, when the outward form prescribed by God is observed,
but without internal worship or devotion of mind.

This displeases God exceedingly, Psalm. 50.^, etc. Esa. 1.10* etc. 29.13. etc.
and 66.3* etc. Ierem. 4.5, etc. Matthew. 15.8 etc.

CHAP. VI. Of Virtues and Works belonging to the Third Commandment.
SO much of the manner of Gods Worship; the hollowing of his Name in all the
rest of our life, is enjoined in the third Commandment; The sum whereof is,
that we must study in all things to sanctify the Name of God, even out of the
times of his ordinary Worship

There be two parts of this command; a prohib^tion, and a confirmation of it.
The prohibition is: Thou shall not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.
The Name of God does not only signify the titles which are given to him, but
his properties also, his word, works, and whatsoever else belongs to the
glorifying of his Name; out of his prohibition is gathered a precept: Thou
shall sanctify the name of thy God: the confirmation is a heavy commination;
For the Lord will not hold him guiltless that takes his name in vain.

The Sanctification of Gods Name is considered, either in affection, or in
effect.

In affection, is zeal for Gods glory; to wit, a vehement affection of the mind
to maintain and enlarge the glory of Gods Name, with just sorrow and
indignation against those things, that are contrary to his glory.

Examples of this, are in Lot, 2. Pet. 2.8. in Moses, Exodus 32.19. in Phi^eas,
Numb. 25.7, 8. in David, Psalm. 69. and ^19.53. in Elijah, 1 Kin. ^19.10. in
Jeremiah, Jer. 23.9, 10.11. in John Baptist, Matt. 14.4. in Christ, Ioh 2.14*
etc. in Paul, Act. 14.14. and 17.16, 17.

To this is opposite, Stupidity, not caring for the glory of God 1 Samuel 2 29.
Thou have honored thy sons more then me. and cap. 3.13. His sons made
themselves vile, and he restrained them not,
, erring zeal which is without knowledge Rom 10.2. For I bear them record, that
they have zeal, but not according to knowledge.
, inconsiderate zeal Jonah. 4.1. And Jonah was displeased exceedingly, and was
very angry; and he prayed unto the Lord and said, I pray thee o Lord, was not
thi^ my saying. etc. Luke 9 54. And when his disciples James and John saw this,
they said, Lord will thou that we speak for fire to come down from heaven and
consume them, etc.
, and counterfeit zeal Esa. 7.12^. Ahaz said, I will not ask a sign, nor will
I tempt the Lord.
.

The Sanctifying of Gods Name in effect or actually, is either by words or by
deeds; Sanctifying by words, is a holy using of Gods Name, and a constant
confession thereof. The holy using of his Name is, whereby we never speak of
him but in cases of necessity, and that with great reverence and admiration;
praising the glory shining in it.

Deuteronomy. 28.58. Thou sha^t fear tha^ most glorious and terrible Name of the Lord
thy God.

To this is contrary, superstitious silence or concealing of Gods Name, the
taking of it in vain, jests made of Scripture phrases, and blasphemy or
disgrace cast immediately upon the Name of God.

An example of horrible blasphemy is in the Assyrian King, I^a. 10. and in
Rabshaketh his Captain, Esa. 37.

The holy using of Gods Name, is in three kinds; to wit, in Consecration,
Swearing, and casting of Lots.

Consecration is, when things for our use are sanctified by the Word of God,
and by Prayer.

To sanctify, in this place, is to separate for a good and lawful use: thus
Temples, Ministers, the works of our vocation, meat and drink are consecrated,
1 Timothy 4.4 5. For whatsoever God has made is good, neither is any thing to be
rejected, if it be received with thanks^giving, for it is sanctified by the
word of God and by Prayers.

To this consecration is opposite, besides the intermission of it,
superstitious consecration, when in certain forms of words, there is believed
to be a singular force and efficacy; so likewise Magic, enchantments and
consecrations.

This consecration is intermitted by them who eat and drink without Prayer and
Thanksgiving, among Papists there are many examples of superstitious
^o^secrations of water, salt, wax, etc. Magic consecrations and enchantments
are not excus^ble, because the words are good; For Gods Word is abused when it
is not used in a good way.

By Swearing, Gods Name is sanctified, both in a simple Oath, and in adjuration.

A simple Oath is the taking of God to witness in weighty matters, as the
Testifier of truth, and the Revenger of lying.

The RULES
I. An Oath in it self is good and holy.

First, because it is commanded by God, Deuteronomy 6.13. and* 10 20 Esa. 65.16. Ier.
12.16. Secondly, because God and his Angels have sworn, Genesis 2^. Psalm. 9^ H^b.
3* and 6 Rev. 10. etc To this purpose is that of Tertullian: O happy are they
for whose cause God swearet^! and O miserable are we, that will not believe God
when he swears!

II. The person swearing must be such a one as may lawful^y swear: and not,
Children. 2. Madmen 3. Such as are convicted of perjury.

III, The matter of an Oath should be things weighty, of good moment and lawful.

IV The form of it is explicated or unfolded by contestation, and imprecation,
abridged and contracted, or consisting of either part.

V. The end is the confirmation of truth, the decision of strife, the
illustration of Gods glory, and the salvation of man.

Heb 6.16.

VI. The object of an Oath by which we must swear in god only.

For so it is commanded, Deuteronomy. 6.13. Fear the Lord thy God, and serve him and
swear by his name. Because, 1. God is the only searcher of hearts, who sees all
things, who is alone Omnipotent, and who revengeth Perjury. 2. Because an Oath
is joined with invocation which only belongs to God, as it is said above.

V^I. Where the Saints in their oaths mention the creatures, metonymically
either God himself is understood, or his vengeance which man wishes to
himself.

So Genesis 31.53. Jacob swore by the fear of his Father, that is, by God whom his
Father Isacc. feared. So Paul, 2 Cor. 1.23. I call God for a record upon my
soul: that is, that ^e will pun^sh me if I knowingly deceive.

V^II. In respect of adjuncts, an Oath is divided into that which is public,
and solemn and enjoined by the Magistrate; or private and voluntary, yet not
rashly offered; Also into an assertory, and a promissary Oath.

IX. Oaths must be kept, though they be extorted from us, and be hurtful to us.

Psalm 15.4: That swears to his ^urt, and changes not. But here it is
demanded, if an oath made to a thief, to free our selves from him, ought to be
kept, Answ. Either the Oath is only to redeem our selves, or else it is to
conceal the whole matter; we are bound in the former to keep our promise, but
not in the latter, seeing we are first and more strictly bound to the
Magistrate, whose office it is to suppress thieves and robbing; therefore,
whosoever out of fear of death* binds himself to a thief in this respect, he
may declare the matter to the Magistrate, and by reason of the tie and
obligation to him, he may be absovled by public authority.

X. Near to swearing is a weighty asseveration.

Such Asseverations are, Genesis 42.15. etc. By the life of Pharaoh: that is, as
truly as Pharaoah lives, and as I wish he may live. So 1 Samuel 1.26. As my soul
lives, my Lord, I am that Woman. To this purpose is that usual asseveration of
Christ's, Verily, Verily.

To swearing in the defect, is opposite the denial of it, or a refusal to take
an Oath, it being lawfully proffered:

The Anabaptists offend the former way, pretending Christ's saying Matthew. 5.34
Swear not at all; and that of James, Jam. 5.12. But they observe not, that in
both these places idolatrous and rash Oaths are forbidden, not such as be
lawful. The latter way they off^nd, who when they may by an Oath promote Gods
glory, or the safety of their neighbor, yet they refuse to do it.

In the excess, are opposed to swearing, 1. Perjury 2. A rash Oath 3. An
unjust Oath. 4. An idolatrous Oath.

Perjury is, when a thing is falsely asseverated, or a promise is made without
purpose of performance, or when the purpose of performance is not performed.

This sin must be avoid^d, 1. Because of the grievousness thereof for a
perjured man offends against God whom he calls upon to be witness to ^his lie,
and so profaneth his most holy name: he offends against his neighbor, whom he
circumvents with his perjury, and grievously scandalizeth he offends against
himself, having wished so many evils to fall upon him. 2. Because of the
grievousnesse of the punishment; for perjuries are never unrevenged: examples
are in the Kings of Sodom* etc. Genesis 14.4. in H^shea King of Israel, 2 Kings 17
4. in Zediciah, 2 King. 25.3: etc. i^ Rudolphus Duke of Bavaria, in Ladislaus,
King of Hu^garia, and many others; it was also detestable among the gentiles:
as Tibullus shows.

Ah miser, etsi quis primo perjuria celet!
Sera tamen tacitis poena venit pedibus.
Though wretch, thou hide thy Perjury,
Yet slow-paced Plagues come silently.
The Jesuitical and Sophistical interpretations of Perjuries; are equivalent to
perjuries themselves; neither shall they escape the sin and pun^shment of
Perjury.

A rash Oath is that, which is taken when there is no necessity to swear.

Saul is an example of a rash and continual swea^er, 1 Samuel 14. v. 40. and 45.

An unjust Oath is, when we swear of things neither lawful nor honest.

Such was David's oath* when he threatened destruction to Nabal's house; by
revoking of which, he has taught us that unlawful oaths are rather to be
broken than kept: 1 Samuel 25. such are the Monkish oath of fidelity, obedience,
and^. in Pop^ry.

An idolatrous Oath is when men swear by false gods or the creatures.

Such are these oaths that are made by Heaven, Earth, etc. which a^e forbid,
Matt. 5.3^. and oaths also made by the Saints; for without idolatry we can
neither give to them the honor of invocation, nor of an oath: neither do the
Papists metonymically by the Saints understand God, but they swear by the
Saints themselves.

So much of swearing: Adjuration is an obtestation in the name of God, being
made either by command, or entreaty; that according to conscience, and as it
were in stead of an Oath, the truth might be spoken.

Example, Ios. 7.19. Then said Joshua to Achan, my Son, give glory to the Lord
God of Israel, and confess to God.

The RULES.
We must yield to an adjuration, in such things as are neither contrary to Gods
glory, nor the love of our Neighbor.

We have an example in Christ, who professed himself to be the S^n of God, upon
the adj^^^tion of the H^gh Priest, though a wicked man: Matthew, 26.64. If then a
Tyrant should adjure us to reveal our brethren or their meetings: we should
refuse it.

To this are contrary rash adjurations, magic adjuration of Devils, wicked
imprecations, whereby God and the creatures are adjured to man's ruin.

The adjuration of Devils, which they call exorcisme, is magical; and no ways
answering the Apostles casting out of Devils, which they did, not by
adjuration, but by commanding them in the name of Christ.

Sortiledge or casting of lots, is a trial or finding out that which God has
appointed to each man in divisions; and this is done by external signs to
compose strife.

Lots are either divine or humane. Examples of those are in Levit. 16. Ios. 7.
1 Samuel 10. Nehem. 11. Ioh. 1. Act 1 and these are not to be imitated, because
we have no command. But these lots called also divisorie, may be used, but so,
that we assure our selves that they are guided by Gods hand. Prove. 16.33.

To this are opposed superstitious elections, and consultations, and deceiptful
lots.

Hitherto of the taking of Gods Name: the profession of it is, when freely and
openly, in the sight of men we confess the truth, as it is known by Gods Word,
to his glory, when we are required.

Matthew. 10.32. Whosoever confesses me before men, him will I confess before
my Father who is in Heaven. Romans 10. v. 10. With the heart we believe unto
righteousness, and with the mouth we confess unto salvation. 1 Pet. 3.15. Be
ye always ready to answer to every one that shall ask a reason of the hope
that is in you.

To this is contrary, 1. A dissembling of the truth: 2. The open denial of it:
3. An unseasonable confession thereof.

An example of dissembling is in the Jews, that would not profess Christ for
fear of being excommunicate, Ioh. 12 v. 42, 43 Peter is an example of an
imperfect denial, proceeding of infirmities, Matthew. 26.69. etc. Concerning
unseasonable confession Christ warns us, Matt. 7.6. Give not that which is holy
unto Dogs, neither cast ye your Pearls before Swine, le^t they tread them with
their feet, and turn upon you and tear you.

Thus we have showed, how Gods name is sanctified in words: it is sanctified in
fact, when our life and actions answer our holy profession.

Mat. 5.16. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good
works, and glorify your Father which is in Heaven.

To this is opposite, the omission of that action which agrees with our
profession, and impiety.

An example of the former, is in Moses, and Aaron, who are said not to have
sanctified God in the sight of the children of Israel, when he gave them the
water of strife out of the rock, Number. 20.12. An example of the later, is in the
Jews, of which Paul speaks, Romans 2.24. For the Name of God through you is
blasphemed among the Gentiles.

CHAP. VII. Of Virtues or Works apperteining to the Fourth Commandment.
HItherto of the parts of Gods worship: Now follows the time peculiarly
appointed for Divine worship.

This is handled in the fourth Commandment; the sum whereof is, That we
sanctify the Sabbath.

There are two parts of this precept; the Precept it self, and the Confirmation
thereof. The Precept is, that we sanctify the Sabbath* which is illustrated,
1. By an Admonitory particle, Remember; etc. By which it appears, that the
Israelites before this had been warned to sanctify it, but that it had been
^lighted and neglected by reason of Pharaoh's oppression. 2. By declaring the
Precept, in opposing by an anti hesis, the works which were to be done the six
days, to those that should not be done the seventh day. 3. By a distribution
of the subjects: for they are either men or beasts. The men are either Natives
or Strangers; and both are either superiors, or inferiors. Six days (says
he) sh^lt thou labor and do all thy work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath
of the Lo^d thy God, in it thou shall do no manner of work, thou, nor thy son,
etc. The Confirmation is grounded on Gods example; For in six days the Lord
made Heaven and Earth the Sea, and all that the^^in is, and rested the seventh
day, Wherefore, etc.

The Sanctification of the Sabbath is whereby man rests from his external works
and labor, that he with his family and cattle may be refreshed, and that day
spent in Gods service.

The RULES.
I. The Precept of sanctifying the Sabbath was not first given on Sinai, but in
Paradise, showing, that the manner of divine worship was prescribed to Adam
even in the state of innocence.

II. To sanctify the Sabbath, is not to make that day holy, but to separate it
from profaneness, and to dedicate it to divine worship.

III. The impulsive causes of this Sanctification, are. 1. Gods command. 2 The
equity of the command. 3. The promises made to them that obey.

This fourth Command is urged also in Lev. 19.3. and 23.3. Ier. 17.22. and
elsewhere. The equity is seen in two things. 1. In that God has separated only
one day of seven for Divine worship. 2. In that he goes before us by his own
example. The promises are in Isa. 56.2. etc. and 58.13.

IV. The matter or object of this sanctification, is the Sabbath or seventh
day, in the Jewish Church: to which succeeded the first day, called in
Scripture from Christ's resurrection, the Lords day; from the Lords supper, the
Day of bread; and from the administration of Baptism, the day of light,
anciently.

V. In the Precept of sanctifying the Sabbath, we must distinguish between
that, which is Ethical or Moral, and that which is Typical or Ceremonial.

It was Ceremonial, 1. To sanctify the seventh day precisely. 2. By this means
to separate Jews from gentiles. But Moral, in that one day of seven must be
sanctified for Gods service. Now the Church has sanctified the first day, by
the example of Christ, who has sanctified it by his resurrection, and
apparition, Ioh 20.19. and 26. By the example also of the Apostolical Church,
Act 20. 7. 1 Cor. 16.2. Rev. 1.10.

VI. The form of Sanctifying this day consists in omission, and action.

VII Things to be omitted, are the works of our outward and temporal callings.

These are opposite to the works of divine worship, in that six days we must
labor.

VIII. Yet some things are permitted, which without great damage cannot be put
off till another day.

Lu. 14.5. Which of you having an ox or ^n ass fallen into a pit, will not
take him out on the Sabbath day? The Macchabes knew this, 1 Mat. 2.41. For
having received an overthrow on the Sabbath, they resolved to defend themselves
against the enemy. In such cases of necessity, Christ's rule must be observed:
The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath, Mar. 2.27.

IX. On the Sabbath those works must be done, for which that day was appointed;
to wit, to repare to the Church, to meditate on Gods word, to receive the
Sacraments, to invite one another by exhortations and example to godliness, to
visit the sick, to help the poor, etc.

X. The end of this sanctifying of the Sabbath, is either natural or spiritual.

XI. The natural end, is, that men and beasts might rest and be refreshed

XI^. The spiritual end, peculiar to the Jews, was, 1 To shadow out to the Jews
that rest which they enjoyed in the Land of Canaan after their toylsome labors
in Egypt, and troubles in the desert. That by this part of their beggarly
rudiments, they might be led to Christ the Author of our spiritual rest from
sin, and the works of the flesh

XIII. But now the spiritual end of it, is, 1. that the Congregation may be
seen and that the faithful may flock together into the Church, as into the Ark
of Noah. 2 That by meditating on this new birth of the World, and on Christ's
resurrection, we might praise God our Creator and Redeemer. 3 That by our rest
from labor, we might be admonished of our rest from sin. 4. That we might more
and more aspire and raise ourselves for the enjoyment of that perpetual rest
and Sabbath in the life to come.

Hence arises a th^eefold Sabbath: a tipical and ceremonial* yet but temp^rary
only: a spiritual, but only begun here; and a heavenly, or eternal.

X^V. The Sanctification of the Sabbath belongs to all, chiefly to Magistrates
and Pastors.

The Magistrate, by the example of Nehemiah, must take care that the Sabbath be
not wantonly abus^d, Neh. 13.15, etc. The same also must so moderate the strict
obs^rvation of that day when need requires, that there be regard had to Charity
by the example of the Macchabees, 1 Mac. 2.41* and Constantine the Great who in
extreme necessity permited Husbandmen to follow their Country wo^k.

XV. The Christian Holy Days have affinity with the Sabbath, appointed not for
Will worship, but for a commemoration of Christ's benefits; so that the
conscience be not entangled with the snare of absolute necessity.

Col. 2.6. Let no man cond^mn y^u in meats and drinks o^ in respect of a Holy
day, or of a New Moon, or of Sabbaths.

To this Sanctification of the Sabbath, are contrary its neglect, and
profanation.

The Sabbath is either simply ne^lected when no regard is had of it: or in some
respect, when it is spent merely by ceasing from our own works, and
consequently in idleness, omitting those works for which the Sabbath was made
(of which in the nineth Rule) or these works are performed but
perfunctoriously, without any inward and mental devotion; which kind of Sabbath
is deservedly called hypocritical.

See Isa. 1.^3, 14.

The Sabbath is profaned, 1. When we do the works of our outward calling
needlessly, as when we make journies or exact debts then, etc. 2. When we spend
the Sabbath in carnal works, as in gaming, dancing, revelling, idle talking,
Stage Plays, and such like sins. 3. ^n idolatrous works.

Such a profanation is a most grievous sin Exodus 31.13.14. Number. 15.35* Neh.
13.16. Ier. 17.27.

CHAP. VIII. Of Virtues or Works belonging in general, to the Commandments of
the second Table.
IN the former Chapters we have spoken of Gods immediate Worship; now follows
the mediate, consisting in the virtues and works of the second Table. Of which
worship we are to speak generally, and particularly

To the mediate worship, and second Table in general, belongs Charity and
Justice. Charity toward men, is either of man toward himself, or toward his
neighbor: toward himself is, whereby each faithful man next to God, loves
himself; seeking his own temporal and eternal welfare.

Mat. 7.12. Whatsoever you would that men should do to you, do ye the same, Ephesians
5.29 No man ever hated his own flesh but rather cherish that. Phil. 2.12. Work
out your own salva^ion with fear and trembling.

To this is contrary self-hatred and self-love, being inordinate.

We see examples of perverse hatred in them who obstinately rebel against God,
and run headlong to their own ruin; but the sin of self-love is found in them,
who being too much drunk with love of themselves, not only despise their
neighbor in respect of themselve, but als^ love themselves above God. Of these
Christ speaks, Joh. 12.25. He that loves his life shall lose it. On the
contrary it is said of the godly, R^v. 12.11. And they loved not their loves
unto the death.

Charity to our neighbor is, whereby we love our neighbor as our selves.

The RULES.
I The efficient cause of this love, is God the Father, in the Son, through the
Holy Ghost.

Gal. 5.22. But the fruit of the Spirit is love.

II. The instrumental cause or root, is Faith working by love.

Gal 5 6.

III. The matter or subject of it is, our neighbor* that is, every one to whom
we ow^ duty, or aid.

Luke. ^0.36 3^*

IV But chief^y w^ (...) love those that are of the household of Faith.

Gal. 6.13.

For we are tied to them both in a natural and spiritual tie; Ephesians. 4, 1, 2.

V. Nor in this case must we exclude our enemies.

For this Charity is commended particularly to us, Exodus 23.4, 5. If thou see
thy enemies Ox or ^sse go astray, etc Prove 25.21. if thy eneme be hungry, give
him bread to eat, etc. See Romans 12 14, 20. Mat. 5.44, etc. For this duty, we
have the example of our heavenly Father, doing good both to the just and
unjust, Mat. 5.48. even giving his Son f^r us his enemies, Romans 5.8.

VI The form of Charity toward our neighbor, consists in the proportion of
charity toward our selves.

Lev. 19.1^. Thou shall love thy neighbor as thy self.

VII. The end is, to witness our love toward God, and to certify our
regeneration and salvation.

1 John 4.20. If any man say he loves God, and hates his brother, he is a liar;
for if he love not his neighbor whom he has seen, how shall he love God whom
he has not seen? 1 John 4.7. Whosoever loves is born of God, and v. 12. if we
love one another; God dwells in us.

To Charity are contrary, 1 The want and neglect of it^ 2 Hypocritical Charity.
3 The unjust hatred of our neighbor. 4 Inordinate Charity, where by we love one
more than is fitting.

Of the first vice, Paul says, 1 Cor. 13.1. If I should speak with the tongues
of men and Angels, and have not Charity, I am a sounding brass, and a tinkling
Cymbal. Of the second, Jam 2.15, 16. If a brother or sister be naked, and
distitu^e of daily food; and one of you say to them depart in peace, be warmed
and filled, notwithstanding ye give not t^ose things that be needful for the
body; what does it profit? Of the third, 1 Job 3.15. Whosoever hates his
bro^her, is a murderer, Of the fourth God himself, 1 Samuel 2.29. Thou have
honored thy sons more than me. And Christ, Mat 10.37 He that loves Father or
mother more than me, is not worthy of me, Yet here we must know, that in two
respects we may hate men: first, when they are Gods enemies, Psalm. 139.21. Do
not I hate them O Lord, that hate thee? Secondly, when they dr^w us from
Christ, or the constant profession of him, Luke 14.26. If any man comes to me,
and hates not his Father, etc.

Charity is considered either absolutely or reciprocally. There be three kinds
of it considered absolutely; to wit humanity, benevolence, and mercy.

Humanity is, when we are ready to testify our love to any, by exhorting,
admonishing, comforting, helping, etc.

This is called (...) affection or care toward one another, 2 Cor. 8 16. It is
called also du^y; and as it is exhibited to strangers, hospitality: this is
recommended to us* Isa. 16.3, 4. Romans 16.23.3 Ioh. v. 8. Heb. 13.2.

To this is opposite inhumanity, by which either the works of humanity are
omitted, or cruelty exercised; as also unseasonable humanity, when courtesies
are performed to those who are unworthy of them, or they are not performed in a
right manner.

It were inhumanity, if one should lay a stumbling block before a blind man, or
should rail against a deaf man, examples of inhumanity are in the Edomites, and
such l^ke Gentiles, adding affl^ction to the afflicted Jews Amos 1 and. 2. In
the Levite and Priest that passed by the man half dead. To be surety for any
man unadvisedly, is an unseasonable humanity, Prove 6.1 and. 11.15. or to give
alms to every one, without regard had of their worth, 2 These. 3.10

Benevolence or favor is, whereby we so incline to the good and weal of our
neighbor, that we pray for his prosperity, and rejoice at it.

Isa. 66.10. Rejoice with Jerusalem etc. To. 12.15 Rejoice with them that
rejoice. There be examples in the blessed Angels, Luke. 2.10. and^ 15.10. in
Paul, Romans 1^8. and many other places in John, 2 John. 4. and 3. John. v. 3, 4,
5.

To this is opposite, Envy or displeasure at another man's good; Malevolence
also, when one wishes the ruin of another; and Counterfeit benevolence.

There are four degrees of Envy. 1 When on^ (...) ^ndure that another should
enjoy the same happiness with him. Examples we have in the laborers that came
first, Man 20.11, etc. and Act. 13.4 5* in the Jews envying salvation in the
Gentiles. 2 When one envieth that in another, which he cannot obtain himself:
examples are in Satan, in Cain Ge. 4. in Esau, Ge. 27 in Joseph's brethren, Act.
7.9. Miriam Moses sister, Number. 12. in Saul, 1 Samuel 18.7.8. in the Nobles of
Persia, Dan. 6 in Pompey and Caesar, of who^ Lucan: Caesar cannot brook a
Superior, no Pompey an Equal. 3. When we cannot endure that another should
enjoy that good, which he enjoys whom we love. An example of this is in
Iosuah, who envied Eldad and M^dad, because they did prophecy as well as Moses.
Nu. 11. in John's Disciples, Ioh. 3.26. amd Christ's, Mar. 9.38. 4. When one
envieth another, or out of malice destroys that which he does not desire he
should enjoy: As when the Philistines stopped the wells which Abraham's
servants had dug, Genesis 26. Like dogs in the manger, not eating hay
themselves, bark at the cattle that eat it, Or like that spotted beast called
S^ellio, devouring his own skin which every year he put off that it may not
help man troubled with the Falling sickness. This sin of envy must be avoided,
1. Because it is earnestly forbid, Psalm, 37.1. Prove. 3.31. 2. Because it is
joined with a disdain of Gods goodness, Mat. 20.15. Is thine eye evil,
because I am good? 3. Because it is the author of much mischief; as of
murder, Genesis 4 2. Sam. 3.20. of seditions, Number. 12. of herisies. It also
disquieteth a man's life, Ia. 3.16 An example of malice, envy, counterfeit,
love, is in the Pha^ises inviting Christ, Luke. 14 1. etc.

Mercy is, when we take another man's misery to heart* so that we study by all
means to assuage, or remove it.

Mat. 5.7. Blessed are the merciful, etc. Luke 6 Be ye merciful, Romans 12.15.
Weep with those that weep. 1 Thessalonians. 5.14. Help the weak, the kinds of this
mercy are rehearsed Mat. 25.35, etc. Examples are in Job, c. 30.35. in David,
Ps. 40, etc. in Jonathan, 1 Samuel 20. in the Samaritan, Luke 10.

To this are contrary, Unmercifulnes, when we pity not the afflicted, or when
we add affliction to them. 2. When we rejoice in other men's miseries. 3.
Counterfeit and unlawful pity.

Unmercifulness is forbid, Prove. 3.27, 28. It deserves judgment without mercy,
Iam. 2.13. Of rejoicing in other men's evils, we have examples, in Doeg, Psalm.
52. in the Edomites, Ps. 137. in Christ's enemies, Mat. 27. It is most earnestly
forbid, Prove. 24.17. Counterfeit mercy is seen in David's enemies, Psalm. 14 7.
This is called the Crocodiles pity, who weeps when he intends to devour a man.
Unlawful mercy is condemned, Jeremy 15. and.16.

So much of the kinds of Charity, considered absolutely. Being considered
respectively, it has for its kinds, Brotherly love, and Friendship. Brotherly
love is that which mutually is entertained by Christ's members, and the
household of Faith.

This reaches so far, that we should lay down our life for our brethren, 1
Ioh. 3.16. Examples are in Jonathan, in the Macchabees, in Paul, etc. This is
to be used toward the dead, in burying them, and mourning for them, etc.

Friendship is love between two or more, whereby they mutually and truly
embrace each other with special benevolence, to perform such duties as are
honest and possible.

The RULES.
I. We are bound to show our selves courteous, benevolent, and merciful to
all; but not to entertain friendship with all.

The reason is, because friendship consists in matual and reciprocal
benevolence, and in such a singulartie, that we ought to impart to our friends
our most secret resolutions: but we cannot with safety trust every man;
therefore we are commanded to walk wisely, zach. 7.7. Let no man ^^ust his
neighbor. Ephesians. 5.15. See then that ye walk warily, not as unwise, but as wise;
redeeming the time, because the days are evil.

II True friendship is judged by its end; to wit, if it be entertained for
piety and honestly.

Aristotle teaches Ethic. 8. that friendship is entertained either for
pleasure, or profit, or virtue; and of these th^ee ends, he only approves the
last: for the vulgar people measure freindship by profit; but the godly must
chiefly look upon virtue or honesty.

To true friendship is opposite that which is counterfeit; also that friendship
which entertains covenants and company with infidels and wicked men.

An example of counterfeit and false friendship, is in David's enemies Psalm. 41.
and 55 13, 14. and in Judas the traitor. As for making covenants with wicked
men, we must know that they are either of peace, or of war. A covenant of
peace, is that which is entertained on both sides for preservation of public
quietn^sse; such was the covenant that Abraham made with Aner and Eshcol, Genesis
14.13 and with Abimelech. Genesis 21.27. and Isaac with the same Abimelech, Genesis
26. ver. 29. of Solomon with Hiram, 1 king 5.2. the covenants of war, are such
as be made for offense and defense; and these either with believers, or
unbelievers: the former are permited, but so, that we trust not in them; the
later are most severely prohibited by God, Exo. 34.12. Take heed that thou make
no covenant with the inhabitants of that land. 2 Cor. 6.14. Be ye not uneqully
yoaked with the wicked. The unhappy events of such covenants are seen in
Iehoshaphat, 2 Chronicles. 16.20. in Asa 1 King, 15. and 2 Cron. 16. in Ahaz, Isa.
7.8, and.9. in the Jews Ezekiel. 16.27.29. It Is lawful to converse with Infidels,
and wicked men; if we have hope to reclaim them, and if we carry our selves
prudently; that we be not corrupted by their familiarity.

So much of charity. Justice is that virtue, whereby we give every man his due.

This name of Justice is ambiguous: for sometimes it implies the observation of
the whole Law; sometimes it has relation to the second Table, as it is
exercised toward our neighbor.

This is either commutative, or distributive. This is employed in distribution
of honors, rewards, punishmentss and such like; observing a Geometrical
proportion, according to the condition, merits, or dignity of the person.

That is, whereby we give to every one his due by an Arithmetical proportion,
according to the equality or inequality of things.

To Justice, Injustice is opposite, both privatively, and contrarily, This is
to be avoided; for it excludes men from the Kingdom of heaven, 1 Cor. 6.9.

CHAP. IX. Of Virtues and Works belonging to the Fifth Commandment.
OF the mediate worship of God, of which we have now spoken in general, both
the parts, and degrees are to be considered. The parts are two, The first is,
of the Superiors duty toward his Inferiors, and contrarily: The later is, of
every man's duty toward another.

The duty of Inferiors to their Superiors, and contrarily, is set down in the
Fifth Precept; The sum whereof is, That between superiors and inferiors, that
order may be kept, which is pleasing to God.

This Command consists of a Precept, and a Promise. The precept is, Honor
thy father and thy mother. By the name of Parents, synecdochically are meant
all Superiors, as the word Honor contains all things that are like honor.
The Promise is, That thou may live long in the land which the Lord thy God
has given thee. In this promise is understood both the condition of Gods will,
and of our salvation: for oftentimes to the godly, God recompenceth the
shortness of this life* with the happiness of ^he other.

The persons considerable in this precept, are Magistrates and Subjects, in the
civil state; Pastors and Hearers, in the Ecclesiasticke; Parents and Children,
Husband and wife, Master and Servants, in the Oeconomick; among which by way of
Analogy may be reckoned, Masters and Scholars, Tutors and Pupils, old men and
young, and such as have more or less of other gifts.

The duties of inferiors to their Superiors, are reverence, obedience, and
gratitude.

Reverence is whereby we bestow upon our Superiors due honor; thinking well
of them, speaking reverently to them, bearing with their infirmities, and
giving them the first place, and leave to speak, or do first.

This reverence is to be given to Magistrates, Romans 13.7. Fear to whom fear,
honor, to whom honor etc. To M^nisters, Matthew. 10.40. He that receives you,
receives me; and he that receives me receives him that sent me. To Parents,
Lev. 19 3. Let every one of you fear his Father and Mother, See Prove. 23.22.
Ephesians. 6.1. To the Husband, Ephesians. 5.33 And the wife see that she reverence her
Husband. To Masters, 1 Timothy 6.1. Let as many Servants as are under the yoke,
count their Masters worthy of all honor. To the aged, Lev. 19 32. Thou shall
rise up before the hoary head, and honor the face of the old man, etc. The
same account must be had of those whom God has honored with some excellent
endowments, who morally are called Elders, not so much for their years, as for
their gifts.

To Reverence is opposite Irreverence and contempt of Superiors.

Examples of irreverence in Subjects, 1 Samuel 10.27. But the children of Belial
said (speaking of Saul) how shall this man save us? and they despised him. In
hearers, Jer. 43.2 Thou speak false (said the Jews) the Lord thy God did
not send thee. In children, Genesis 9.22. But Cham the Father of Canaan looking
back showed the nakedness of his Father to his brethren without. In the wife,
Job. 2.9. Then said his wife to him, do thou still retain thine integrity?
curse God and dye. In servants, Genesis 16.4. When Hagar saw that she had
conceived, her Mistress was despised in her eyes.

Obedience or Subjection is whereby we obey our Superiors in things lawful and
honest, as the Lord: and patiently bear their admonitions and corrections.

The Magistrate must be obyed, Romans 13.1. Let every soul be subject to the
higher powers, etc. Ministers, Heb. 13.17. Obey and hearken to those that are
set over you, for they watch for your souls. Parents, Ephesians. 6.1. Children obey
your Parents in the Lord, Husbands. Ephesians. 5.22. Wives be subject to your own
husbands, as to the Lord Masters, Ephesians. 6.5. Servants, be obedient to them that
are your Masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in
singleness of heart, as unto Christ.

The RULES
I. We must obey, not only godly Magistrates and Masters, but also Tyrants.

1 Pet. 2.13. Be subject to every Ordinance of man for the Lord, and ver. 18.
Servants, be subject with all fear to your Masters, not only to those that are
good and just, but also to the froward, for this is praiseworthy, if any man
for conscience toward God suffer trouble, being unjustly afflicted. Examples
are in the Israelites obeying Pharaoh, Exodus 3, etc. In Daniel obeying
Nebuchadnezzar, Dan. 2.

II But they are not to be obeyed in things contrary to Gods Word, and a good
Conscience.

An example we have in the midwives, Exodus 1. in Saul's Servants, 1. Sam. 22.17.
in Daniel, Dan. 6. in the Apostles, Act. 4.19 saying, Whether it be right in
the sight of God to obey you rather than God, judge ye?

To obedience is contrary, Disobedience, rebellion, impatience of correction,
and obedience in things unlawful.

We have examples of disobedience and rebellion in Miriam and Aaron, Numb. 12
in Corah, Dathan and Abiram, etc. Numb. 16 in the Israelites, Numb. 13. in
Absolon* 2 Samuel 16. in Seba, 2 Samuel 20. and such like; in the Israelites
contemning the Prophets, in Elias sons 1 Sa. 2 Lots wife, Ge. 19. Ge hazi. 2
Kin. 5. Of unlawful obedience, an example is in Do^g, 1 Sa. 22 Gratitude is,
whereby inferiors in acknowledging the good will and bounty of their
superiors, do testify their thankful mind in will, and deed; where, and when
they can.

This is to be performed to the Magistrate, by rendering Tribute, Custom, etc.
Romans 13 7 and by praying for him, 1 ^^m. 2.1, etc. To M^n^sters, 1 These. 5.12.
We beseech you, brethren, to know them who labor among you, and have the
charge over you in the Lord, and admon^sh you, that you would have them in
exceeding great love for their works sake To Parents Prove 23.25 thy Father and
mother shall be glad, and she that bare thee shall rejoice. Examples, are in
Joseph, David, etc. Which gratitude in special is called (...), signi^ying that
gratitude of the young Storks toward the old, in feeding and bearing them.

To gratitude is opposite, Ingratitude, whereby Superiors are either not
requited, or ill requited: Examples of which, the Scripture is full.

So much of the Virtues or duties of Inferiors, the Virtues of Superiors, are
benevolence, justice, and sedulity.

Benevolence is whereby Superiors carry a good affection to their inferiors,
which they declare when occasion serves.

An example of this Benevolence is proposed to M^gistrates in Moses, Exodus 32.
to Ministers in Paul, To 9 1. The same is commanded to Parents, Ephesians. 6.4. and
you Fathers, provoke not your children to wrath, and this good will of Parents
is called (...) among the Gentiles, which is from (...) to love, a word used
properly to express the affection and natural love of parents and Children; the
same is urged by Paul to Husbands, Ephesians. 5.25. Husbands, love your Wives as
Christ loved the Church, etc. and to Masters, Ephesians. 6.9. and ye Masters, do the
same thing to them, forbearing threa^nings, knowing that your Master also is in
heaven, etc.

To this is opposite the contempt, of Inferiors, want of love or astorgie, and
such like.

Of the contempt of inferiors God speaks Deuteronomy. 17. v. 20. Let not his heart
be lifted up above his brethren, of Astorgie or want of affection, Christ
speaks Matthew. 7 9. What man among you is there, that if his Son ask him b^ead
will give him a stone?

The Justice of Superiors is, whereby they endeavor that every inferior have
his due.

This is performed by the Mag^strate, in keeping both Tables of the Law; and in
promoting and defending the true Religion, as we showed in the former Book, in
the doctrine of the true Church: they practice the same justice, in making
laws, punishing offenders, rewarding the keepers of it, and in defending their
Subjects against unjust force.

To this is opposite, the neglect of justice, and tyranny.

Of the neglect of Justice, see Esa. 1.23. They judge not the fatherl^ss;
neither does the cause of the Widow come unto them. Of injustice and tyranny in
the same place: Thy Princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves. God
reproves this most severely, Ezekiel. 34. in the Pastors of the people of Is^ael:
Parents also offend either by too much indulgence, as Eli, 1 S^. 2. or by too
much rigor as Saul, 1 Samuel 14.

Sedulity, which is also called diligence, fidelity, vigilancie, is a virtue
whereby Superiors willingly undergo the labors of their offices, and endeavor
by the gifts they have received from God, to help their Inferiors.

Of this virtue, the Apostle speaks. Romans 12.8. He that rules, let him rule
with diligence; ^he sa^e is urged by Paul to M^nisters and Elders, Act 20.28.
Take heed to your selves, and to the whole Flock in which the Holy Ghost has
made you Overseers: Parents show this when they nurture their Children in the
fear of God. Ephesians. 6.4. and when they lay up for them things temporal, 2 Cor.
12.14.

To this is opposite, Sloth and business about impertinent things.

Against Sloth* God c^yes out, Jer. 48.10. Cu^sed is he that does the work of
the Lord negligently: of ^mpertinent business Peter speaks, 1 Pet. 4, 15. Let
none of you suffer as a murderer or a thief, or an evil doe^, or as a
busie-body in other men's matters.

CHAP. X. Of Virtues and works belonging to the Sixth Commandment.
HItherto of the Virtues and duty of Superiors to their ^nferiours, and on the
contrary. Now follows the duty of each man toward every man: and this is
employed either about the inward, or outward good things of men. Their inward
good things are life, and chastity: Of life we are to handle in the sixth
precept; the sum whereof is, that we preserve our own, and our neighbors life.

Thou shall not kill is a negat^ve precept; out of which is gathered this
affirmative, Thou shall p^e^erve t^ine own, and thy neighbors l^fe.

The virtue then commanded here, is the study of preserving our own, and other
men's lives: The conservation of our own life, consists in the lawful use of
lawful means: of which kind are meat and drink, recreation, physic, avoiding
of dangers, and driving away of injuries.

The RULE.
Then is the repeling of an injury lawful, when it is done, ^. In the
continent, or sober. 2. In case of necessity. 3. Without desire of revenge or
hurt but so that we intend only our own conservation, and defense from
injuries.

To this conservation of our own life, is opposite the neglect of it; as also
the destroying of it violently by our own hands, and unlawful preserving of it.

They who neglect the mean of preserving life they sin by omission; but they
that put violent hands on themselves, sin by commission. N^w there be certain
degrees of self-murder; for either it is done directly by Sword Halter, or
Poison, or any such way, or else indirectly: so they kill themselves, who
rashly and wantonly expose themselves to danger, as Wrestlers, Rope dancers,
Drunkards, Gluttons, etc. the unlawful preserving of life is, which is done by
lying, or such like means.

The study of preserving our neighbors life, is, when not only we abstain
from hurting it, but we love his life, and preservation, and defend it
according to our power.

To this is opposite the neglect of it, and unjust slaughters, hatred, cursing,
and railing, or upbraiding of any offense committed, or inhering infirmities.

An example of neglect is in them, who when they may defend those that unjustly
suffer death, do not, Prove. 24.11* etc. If thou forb^a^ to deliver them who are
drawn unto death, and those that are ready to b^ sl^in; if thou say behold
we knew it not, etc. How grievous unjust slaughter is, which is done out of
private desire, and not by the Magistrate, or public authority; and how
grievous a pun^shment this deserves, may be seen, Genesis 9.6. Who sheddeth man's
blood by man his blood shall be shed; because God made man after his image. Of
hatred, thus says John 1 Epist. 3 15. Whosoever hates his brother, is a
manslayer. Of evil speaking or cursing, Christ says, Mat. 5.22. Whosoever
shall say to his bro^her, Racha shall be in danger of the Counsel: but
whosoever shall say, thou fool, he shall be in danger of Hell fire.

To this duty are subordinat two kinds of virtues; some whereof conduce to
withhold our selves, and some to withhold others, and deter them from murder.

Of the first kind are Innocence, Mildness, Clemency, and Moderation.

Innocence is when we avoid all means of hurting our neighbor.

To this is opposite, Injury in word and deed, and counterfeit innocence.

That words are injurious and hurtful to man's life, is manifest; for he is not
esteemed to live, but he that lives well: Hence Christ accounts evil words
murder, Mat. 5. of counterfeit innocence we have in Pilate an example, in
washing his hands, Matthew. ^7.

Mildness is a virtue whereby we curb and bridle our anger, that it may not
wax inordinately hot.

Matthew. 5.5. Blessed are the meek, for they shall inh^rt, etc.

To meekness is opposite, anger, unjust wrath, too much gentleness or want of
just anger, and desire of revenge.

Of anger Solomon says Eccles. 7 9. Be not hasty in the spirit to be angry: Of
unjust ange^, Moses Le. 19.18. Thou shall not avenge, nor bear a grudg against
the children of thy people: Of Eli the Priest's too much gentleness, we read 1 Samuel 2. The desire of revenge is condemned in the place of Lev. 16. above
alleged.

Clemency is a just moderation in inflicting of punishments.

To this is opposite fierceness, or Cruelty, and too much Indulgence.

Both sins are kinds of murder: for by too much rigor, and too much
indulgence, we sin against the life of our neighbor. He hurts the good, that
spares the evil.

Moderation is a virtue much like to Clemency, whereby we are content to part
with our right, either for the public good, or for the good of them who
offend, or for avoiding of scandal.

This differs from Clemency: because this is properly ascribed to the
Magistrate, but moderation is required of all Christians, Phil. 4.5

To this is opposite: too much Right, which is commonly called, too much Wrong.

Of the later sort are, Vindicative Justice, and Fortitude.

The former is when offenses are curbed with fit Punishments, that one rather
may perish than unity.

To this is opposite too much Lenity, (...) begets too much liberty in sinning

Not only is it a sin to kill, but also not to kill* when the Law requires it:
Of this we have an example in Saul 1 Samuel 1^.

Fortitude is that, whereby according to the strength and vigor of a high and
unconquered mind, we endure difficulties, and undertake high matters to Gods
glory, and our neighbors safety.

To this, sluggishness is opposite, or pusilanimity, arising out of fear of
dangers, or desire of pleasures; Temerity also, and too much boldness. To this
also belong Duels undertaken for deciding of doubtful rights, or upon other
light and rash occasions.

Such Conflicts may be fi^ly reduced to Self-murder.

Both these, to wit Justice, and Fortitude, appear either in Peace, or in War.

War is public hostility, which the Magistrate exercises with armed power,
for ends ple^sing to God, and profitable to the State.

The RULES.
I It is as lawful for Christians to wage war, as it was of old for the Jews

The reason is, because it is no where proh^b^ted in the New Testament, And
that Captain of the Capernaites, Matthew. 8 and Cornelius the Centurion, Acts 10.
are reckoned amongst the faithful. Neither did John dehor^ the soldiers from
wars, but from injustice* Luke 3.

II. War is to be managed by the Magistrate, not by private authority.

III. War must not be m^de, but that which is just and necessary.

IV. It will be just in respect of the matter, form, and end, if it be made in
a just cause, for a good end, and according to the prescript of Gods word.

V. It will be necessary* if the matter be tried by Council, before it be
handled by Arms

VI. When war is undertaken, it matters not whether it be managed by strength
or policy

VII. Policy joined with lying and breaking of covenants, is not to be allowed;
but it may be approved with dissimulation.

VIII. Although the Church is built by the Word, not by the Sword; yet being
built, is justly to be defended by the Sword against unjust violence.

CHAP. XI. Of Virtues and Works belonging to the Seventh Commandment.
Thus of our duty toward the life of our neighbor. In the seventh Precept is
set down, how we must preserve our own, and neighbors Chastity; the sum
whereof is, that the Heavenly lawgiver would have our own, and neighbors
chastity preserved inviolable.

This precept is negative, Thou shall not commit adultery; and Synecdochical
also: for under the name of Adultery, all lust and intemperance is understood.
Hence arises the affirmative; that by endeavoring temperance we preserve our
own and others chastity.

There be two-means to preserve chastity; Temperance, and Wedlock: the first is
en^oyned to all men; the other to those that are called to Wedlock.

Temperance is a virtue, moderating the affections of our mind, in pursuing and
avoiding bodily pleasures.

Tit. 2.11, 12, 13. The grace of God which brings salvation to all men, has
appeared; teaching us to deny ungodliness, and worldly lusts, and that we
should live soberly, justly and godly in this present world, looking for that
b^essed hope and glorious appearance of the mighty God, and of our, Savior
Jesus Christ.

To Temperance is opposite intemperance and insensibility, whereby honest and
lawful delights are despised, also Hypocritical temperance is, of Monks and
Eremites.

Temperance is, both Sobriety and Chastity, as also Modesty and honesty: The
former virtues have relation to us, the later to our neighbor.

Sobriety is temperance from superfluous meat, and drink.

We must study to Sobriety, 1. Because of Gods command. 2. Because of the
reason annexed to it, taken from our calling, 1 Thessalonians. 5.8. But let us who are
of the day, be sober. From the necessity of Prayer and from the end of the
World, 1 Pet. 4.7. But, the end of all things is at hand, be yet therefore
sober, and watch unto prayer. Lastly, from the snares of Satan, 1 Pet. 5.8. Be
sober and watch, for your adversary the Devil walks as a roaring Lion seeking
whom he may devour.

To Sobriety is opposite Delicateness, whereby dainties, and delicacies are
sought for immoderately in meat, and drink: Gluttony also, or Voracity,
Drunkenesse, and hurtful Abstinence.

Of dainties, Solomon speaks, Prove. 23.1, 2.3 When thou sit to eat with a
Ruler, consider diligently what is before thee; and put a knife to thy throat,
if thou be a man given to appitite: be not desirous of his dainties, for they
are deceitful meats. Gluttony and drunkenesse are to be avoided, 1. Because
they are prohibited by God, Prove. 23.20.31. Luke 21.34. Rome 13.13. 2. Because
the effects thereof are most pernicious, for they hinder the meditating on Gods
works, Isa. 5.19: and thinking upon Christ's coming, Lu. 21 34. Prayers also, 1
Pet. 4.7. It stirs up anger and strife, Prove. 21.1. and 29.30. It kindles lust,
Prove. 23.31, 32. It causes scandal, as the examples of Noah shows, Ge. 9.
and shut out of Gods kingdom, 1 Cor. 6.10. Gal. 5.21. Hurtful abstinence is,
when we refrain from meat and drink, to the prejudice of our health

Near to Sobriety is Vigilancie, when we abstain from untimely, and too much
sleep, that we mae serve God with cheerfulness, and follow the works of our
vocations.

1 Pet. 5.8 Be sober and watch. Now as under the name of Sobriety, sonetime
abstinence from pride and evil affections is meant, Romans 12 3. so often times
spiritual vigilancie is understood as an abstinence from the sleep of security,
to which Peter has respect in the place above cited.

To Vigilancie is opposite Sleepiness, and Monkish superstitious Watchings.

Chastity, or Sanctimony so called, Romans 6.19. is temperance from lust.

We must follow chastity, 1. Because God commands it, Lev. 19.2. Be ye holy for
I the Lord your God am holy. 1 Thessalonians. 4.3 This is the will of God, even your
holiness, that ye abstain from fornication. 2. Because they that follow it
shall see God, Matthew 5.8. Heb. 12.14.

To Chastity is opposite, both Dissembled chastity, as is that of them who are
tied with the vow of chastity, as also all impurity, as Fornication, Adultery,
Whoredom Incest, Rapes, softness, ^odomy, Beastiality, etc,

Although there be degrees a^ these sins, yet all of them exclude from the
Kingdom of Heaven, as is taught plainly 1 Cor. 9 ^0, etc. and how grievously
God, is offended at these sins let the Flood, the fire of Sodom, the
destruction of the Israelites, Number. 23. the miseries of David, the ^uine of
Troy and the like bear witness.

Modesty is temperance from filthy words, and lascivious gestures.

Heb 12.28 (...) us have grace whereby we may acceptab^y serve God with
reverence and godly fear, (or modesty.)

To this is opposite, Filthy communication, lascivious and unclean gestures,
Dances also, obscene Pictures, and Songs, and filthy sights

Prove 6.12, 13 Anaughty person, a wicked man walks with a froward mouth, he
w^nketh with his eyes, he speaks with his feet, he teaches with his fingers,
and v. 25. Lust not after her beauty in thine heart, niether let her take thee
with her eye lids; so by means of a whorish woman, man is brought to a piece of
bread, etc* Ephesians 5.4. Neither fi^thines no^ fool^sh talking, nor j^sting which
ar^ nor convenient.

Honesty, is temperance from filthy or lascivious trimming, and clothing of
the body.

Exodus 20.26. Neither shall thou go up by steps unto mine Altar, that thy
nakedness be no^ discovered thereon. 1 Timothy 2.9 Let wom^n adorn themselves with
modest apparel, with sh^mefa^ednesse, and sob^^e^y.

So much of the former means of preserving Chastity, the la^er is Wedlock.

Wedlock is an indissoluble con^unction of one man with one woman, by lawful
consent; instituted for Gods glory and the good of the parties so conjoined.

The RULES.
I. Marrige is not only grounded on the Law of Nature and of Nations, but also
on the Law of God; for it was instituted and commanded by God, and was by
Christ vindicated from abuses and corruptions.

Genesis 1.28. and 2.22. Matthew, 19.8, etc.

II. Neither is it made rashly, or without Gods particular providence.

Prove. 19.14. Avereuous woman is from the Lord.

III. The proximate efficient cause is lawful consent.

IV. This consent is both of the parents, and of the parties to be married.

V. In respect of time, the consent of parents should go before, for the
preservation of filial reverence.

Exodus 22.17. If the Father refuse to give her. Deuteronomy. 7.3. Thou shall not give
thy Son to any of their daughters, neither shall thou take any of their
daughters for thy son. Jer. 29.6. Take you wives for your sons and give your
daughters to husbands. By the events, we find that marriages made without
consent of Parents prove oft-times unhappy.

VI But in Law, the consent of the parties to be married is of greatest force.

The reason is because if there be not a cojugal consent, there would be no
love nor mutual-benevolence, and consequently no marriage, Therefore as it
belongs to filial reverence to require the Parents consent in the first place;
so it is the part of fatherly love, not to debar tyrannically their children
from honest matches, nor to force them being unwilling, to mary. Therefore the
marriage is not nullified because the Parents do not consent to it, unless the
parties to be married be under years, or some other weighty causes do hinder:
But if Parents have not sufficient causes either of hindering, or forcing the
marriage, yet their consent must not therefore be slighted; but Magistrates,
Ministers, and Friends shall do well to put Parents in mind of their duty, that
at least they may give their consent

VII. As consent should be free from coaction, so should it be also from fraud.

Diverse frauds are used in making of matches: which either concern the Person,
so Jacob was cozened by taking Leah instead of Rachel; or the chastity of
either, as if a man should ignora^tly marry her that had lost her maidenhead;
or their estates, as if one should be made believe that his Bride were rich or
nobly descended. The first kind of fraud dissolves the marriage; for Jacob
might have repudiated Leah, because there was no consent given before, As for
the second kind, it is Moses his verdict, Deuteronomy. 22. that such a woman should be
held for an adulteress, and stoned to death: but our usual custom is, that if
the man had carnal commere with the woman, he is to retain her. But the third
kind of fraud, does not dissolve the marriage*

VIII. If there be an absolute consent given, it is called a contract in the
present; but if with condition of Parents consent, dowry, etc. it is called a
contract for the future: The first kind of consent is the true beginning of the
present marriage; the later makes not marriage, except the condition required
be kept, or else when impatient of staying for the accomplishing of it, there
be carnal commerce.

IX The matter of wedlock, are the parties to be married in whom we are, 1. To
consider their Number, 2 Their Age: 3. Their neernesse in blood, etc. 4. Their
Religion.

X. As for the Number, Marriage is of one Male and one Female; hence Bygamie
and Polygamie are condemned.

The reasons are, 1 Because bygamie and polygamie are repugnant to the 1.
instit^tion whereby God joined to one Adam but one Woman, not two, nor more,
Ge. 2 2. Because it is repugnant to the restrauratio^ of the Law given by God
in the beginning: Man shall cleave to his wife, they two shall be one: which
restoration was done by Christ Mat. ^9 5. And they that were two are made one
flesh* 3 Because a wicked man was the invent^r of bygamy and polygamie; for the
first that had two w^ves was Lamech (...) 4 4. Because true peace and polygamie
cannot consist, as Jacobs example sh^w^th, Genesis 30. and Elkanahs, 1 Sa^ Now
albeit God at first tolerated Concubinate and Bygamie, yet he did not therefore
approve it: for the contrary appears by Christ's words above ci^ed; that place
in Le. 18.18, a^ Iunius ^^a^st resit, planly fo^bi^s poligamy

XI. Convenient age is required, for procreation sake, for Oeconomical
prudence, and for the honor of such a holy institution.

XII. By what degrees of neernesse marriage is hindered, See Levit. 18.

XIII. This is either Consanguinity or Affinity; that is of them who come from
the same common stock; this is either of the Wife with the Husband, or of the
Husband with the Wives kindred

Properly there is no affinity between the kindred of the Husband and Wife

XIV. In these we must observe the degrees and line: the degree is the distance
from the stock or common Parent: the line is the series and order of the
degrees either among the ascendents, and descendents, and this is called the
right line; or among the collaterals, and this is called the transverse line;
and it is named, either equal, or unequal.

The degrees and line are chiefly considered in Consanguinity, but in Affinity
by way of analogy, for in what degree one is near in blood to his Wife, in the
same, is she in affinity to the Husband.

XV. The degrees of marriage are not to be judged by the Canon law; (because
the Pope advancing himself above every power, adds degrees not prohibited, to
those which God has prohibited, and for many dispenses with those degrees
which God has prohibited expressly) but out of Lev. 18. and Deuteronomy. 27.

XVI. In the straight line of ascendents and descendents, there is a perpetual
hinderance of marriage

Hence, if Adam were alive, he could not marry any other but Eve, nor she to
any other Husband besides Adam.

XVII. In the equal collateral line, by divine right, the Brother and Sister in
Consanguinity are debarred from marriage: the Husband also and Sister of his
deceased Wife, or the Wife and Brother of the deceased Husband*

The law of God does not disallow the marriages of Cosin-German, by the Fathers
and Mother side; but the Canon Law does, and so do the Statutes of other
Commonwealths, as that of Basil. The reason of this is, that with the greater
reverence we might abstain from the degrees prohibited by God.

XVIII In the unequal collateral line, they cannot marry, who are in stead of
Parents, who are collaterally joined to the stock, or their Superiors.

Therefore the Nephew cannot marry with either Aunts, nor the Niece with either
Uncles. As for Affinity; marriage with the Wives Sister; or with the Husbands
Brother, is forbid by the Law of nature: in others, affinity does not extend it
self so largely; the Husband should abstain from the Wives kinswoman, but not
the Husbands kinsman from the Wives kindred, and on the contrary, Therefore two
Brothers may marry with two Sisters; the Father and the Son, with the mother
and the Daughter; but not the Father with the Daughter, or Son with the Mother,
for so the order of nature should be perverted: Son-in law also may marry with
Daughters in-law, but the Father and Son cannot marry two Sisters, for one of
them should be Mother-in-law to the other

XIX. Regard must be had of Religion, that marriages, be not made between those
of different Religions.

It is one thing to speak of a marriage already made, and of that which is to
be made; of the former, the Apostle speaks, 1 Cor. 7.3. but the other is most
severely prohibited, Exodus 34.12 and. 16, etc. Deuteronomy. 7.3. where a reason is
added taken from the danger of seducing: to which Paul's saying agrees, 2 Cor.
6.14. Be ye not unequally yoked with the wicked. Sad examples we have of the
events of such marriages; of the first World, Genesis 6^ of Solomon, 1 King. 11. of
Ahab, 1 King. 21.15. of Iehosaphat, who married Ahabs Daughter to his Son
Ioram, who was seduced by her, 2 King. 8. Of Valence the Emperor, who by his
Wife was seduced and drawn to Arianisme.

XX. The form of marriage consists in the mutual benevolence of the married
couple: under which word we understand mutual love, help, comfort, and such
like.

See 1 Cor. 7.3, 4, 5. Ephesians. 5 22, etc. 1 Timothy 2* 8. 1 Pet. 3.1. and 5. etc.

XXI. Although the rite of public consecration is not expressly commanded by
God, yet it is religiously observed among Christians

XXII. The chief end of marriage, is Gods glory; the subordinate, is natural,
or adventitious: natural, is that for which marriage was at first instituted,
to wit, for procreation of Children, and for mutual help; the adventitious is,
that now since our nature is corrupted, it may be a help to preserve chastity,
and modesty.

XXIII. The precept of marriage is not simply necessary, nor does it tie all
men, but binds them only, who out of marriage cannot live chastely, and
therefore in a manner seem to be made for marriage

Mat. 19 ^1. All (...) take this saying but etc.

XXIV. Therefore as marriage is honorable, so it becomes all orders among men

Imp^ously then do the Papists for bid the Priest to marry. That it is
honorable in it self, is plain, by the Apostles saying, H^b. 13.4 marriage is
honorable in all; and by the divine inst^tution of it in the state of
innocence* Genesis 2. by the defending of it from abuses, Mat. 19. and by Christ
honoring of it with his presence, and first miracle in Cana of Galilee John 2
that it is also decent in Ministers, is said lib. 1^.26 can. 3.

XXV If one marry her wi^h whom he has committed Adultery, this is not
marriage, but a continuation of Adultery.

Some things are repugnant to marriage simply; other things only in some
respect.

Those things are repugnant to it in some respect, which disturb the peace and
mutual benevolen^e of the married couple, of which sort are, 1. Jealousy 2.
Sloth in houshold-affairs. 3. Peevishness and bitterness. 4. Stubborness, idle
prating, procacity. But to marriage are repugnant simply, Adultery, and
malicious deserting.

So is adultery described in those places, in which it is forbid as a deadly
sin, Lev. 18 20, and 20.^0 Deu. 22.22. P^o 5. and 6. Therefore that is only
adultery which is committed with an other man's wife* whether he be a married or
unmarried man that commits it; but if the husband go to bed to a single woman
or a whore, that is called fornication in scripture, Pro. 23.27, 28.

A. R. Divorce is caused by either of these; Divorce is eith^r in ^^spect of
the bed, o^ in resp^ct of Cohabitation* and (...) A^ultry is either publicly
known or else, but suspected and hid* known Adul^ery is to be punished by the
Magistrate, with divorce from bed and ^o^abitation for suspected and close
Adult^^^ the parties married may divo^ce each other from the bed, not from
cohabitation; because thi^ is a public pun^shment; and i^ is to be inflicted
by a (...) Magist^ate. But in every case of Adultery D^vorce is not r^qu^si^e
or lawful: For 1, If the party off^nding repent, the party off^nded ought to
f^rgiv^ and be rec^nci^ed. 2. If ^here be d^ng^r le^t the off^nding party fall
in a some d^sperate course upon divorcement. 3 If the Husband prostitute his
w^fe to another, he being the cause rathe^ of the adultery ^han^sh^. 4. If the
woman is rav^shed by ano^he^ man against her will. 5. If the man, after the
woman has committed Adultery, and he knows it, admits her again unto his bed;
in this case, he is not to divorce her for the former fact. 6 If both the
Husband and wife be guilty of adultery, the one is not to divorce the other. 7.
If the Husbands long absence and silence has occasioned the Wife to conceive
he is dead, and she marry another; in this case, if he return, he is bound to
receive his Wife again. In all those cases then, Divorce is not to be used; for
Christ commands it not, but permits it. Again, if a man intending to marry one
sister, unwillingly marries the other, being deceived as Jacob was by Laban in
marrying Leah in stead of Rachel, he is not bound to divorce her*
Divorce is caused by either of these.

Mat. 19.9 But I say unto you, whosoever put^th away his wife, except it be for
Fornication and (...) another, commits Adultery 1 Cor. 7.15, But if the
unbelieving depart; let him depart, a Brother or a Sister is not under bondage
in such cases.

CHAP. XII. Of Virtues or Works belonging to the Eight Commandment.
AFter our duty in preserving our own and neighbors Chastity, follows our duty
toward our own and Neighbors goods. Of this in the eight Precept, the sum
whereof is, That we endeavor justly to preserve our own, and Neighbors goods.

The Precept is Negative, and Synecdochical: Thou shall not steal: whereby the
name of theft, Synecdochically is meant any kind of injustice toward the good
of fortune; whence the Affi^mative is inferred, that in earthly things we deal
justly.

The Virtues of this Precept, have relation either to our neighbor, or to our
selves.

To our Neighbor are referred Justice and Beneficence. The Justice belonging to
this is commutative, whereby we deal so with our neighbor, that neither he nor
our selves receive any wrong.

1 Thessalonians. 4.6. Let no man oppress, or circumvent his brother in business; for
the Lord is the Revenger of all such, etc

To Justice is opposite Injustice, which in this precept is called Theft.

Theft is, when one makes another man's goods his own, without the owners
knowledge or consent.

The RULES.
I. Theft is diversely committed if either we look upon the manner, or the
object.

II. As for the manner, Theft is committed either directly, or indirectly;
directly, (...) ^aking away another man's goods privately, or without the owners
knowledge An example of private theft, is in Micha the Ephraimite, who without
his mothers knowledge took away eleven hundred shekels of silver, Judge. 17.^.
; or by open violence without the owners consent, though not without his
knowledge They that commit theft with open violence, are called robbers,
whether they be soldiers or others, Luk 3.14. But the soldiers asked John,
saying, And what shall we do? and h^ said strike no man, neither oppress any
man, but be content with your wages.
. Indirectly theft is committed, either in deeds, or in words: In deeds, when
the thing found is not restored Deuteronomy. 22.1. Thou shall not see thy brothers Ox
or his Sheep go astray, and hide thy self from them; thou shall in any case
bring them again to thy brother.
or when it is parted among theives Prove. 29.24. Whosoever is partaker wi^h a
Thief hates his own soul:
; in words, when in the Courts of justice, Lawyers and Judges either pronounce
an unjust Sentence, or pervert Justice and Law ^sa. 1 23. Thy Princes are
rebellious* and companions of th^eves; every one loves gifts, and follows
after rewards; they jugde not the fatherless, neither does the cause of the
widow, etc.
.

III. As for the object, theft is committed either in person^ Such kind of
theft is called Plagium in Latin, See 1 Timothy 1.10.
, or in things whether private or public: hither may be reduced the
perfidious admini^^ring of the public goods in a Commonwealth 1 Cor. 4 2. It
is required of a Steward that he be found faithful.
, o^ in the Church, and thing* ^onsecrated to God This Theft is called
sacrilege, Pro. 20.25 It is a snare to the man who d^voureth that which is
holy, etc. An example of this in Achan, Jos. 7. and in Judas, Ioh 12.6
; the removing of bounds, or landmarks Prove. 22.28 R^m^ve not ^he ancien^
bound^ which thy Fathers have set.
, the fraudulent detaining of the hirelings wages ^am. 5.4. Behold the hire of
the laborers which have reaped your fields (which is of you kept back by
fraud) c^y^th.
.

Commutative Justice according to the variety of bargains and contracts, is
threefold: for either it is exercised in things to be bought and sold, or in
things to be used, or in things to be kept, Justice in buying and selling, is
which observes the equality of things, and of their price.

To this is opposite injustice, which is practiced, 1. In things not vendible
Act. 8.20. Thy money perish with the^ who think the gift of God may be
obtained with mo^y, says Peter to Simon Magus: therefore they are not
followers of Simon Peter, but of Simon Magus, who make Merchandise of holy
things. Like to those are they, who sell Law and Justice and Offices, and such
like.
, 2: In things vendible; and here the seller offends, when he sells things
corrupted for sound As when chaf or such like trash is mingled with Wheat: and
Water with Wine; Amos 8.6. That we may sell the refuse of the Wheat
, using false weights and measures Deuteronomy. 25.13. Thou shall not have in thy bag
diverse weights, Amos 8.5. Making the Epha^ small, and the Shekel great, and
falsifying the balances by dece^^.
, raising the price of things when there is no need Amos 8 6. Tha^ they may buy
the poor for silver.
, by fore-stalling the markets, to set up monopolies These are like wanton
sheep, who when they are filled, tread the remaining fodder under their fe^t
Ez^k. 34.18.
: but the buyer offends either by crafty seizing upon the thing sold Prove 20*
14. It is naught says the buyer, but when he is gone he prai^eth himself.
, or by not paying Psalm. 37.21. The wicked borrows, and pays not again.
.

Justice in the use of things, is, when in letting and hiring, the use or fruit
is equal to the profit: In such a contract let the rule prevail, 2 Cor. ^ 13.
Not that other men be ea^ed, and you burdened, but by an equali^y.

To this is opposite in justice, both in the Letter and Hirer, the Letter
offends in demanding the price of that which he ought to let freely God of old
forbad the Jews to exact a price of their brethren. Exodus 22 25 So Christ Luk^
6.35. Lend* looking for nothing again. Which rule is then in force, when our
neighbor estate is so mean, that he is not able to pay
, or in asking too great a price 2 Cor. 8.3. Not that others may be eased and
you burdened* and on the contrary.
, or requiring the thing let, sooner than he should Experience witn^sseth how
hurtful this kind of injustice is.
, the Hirer offends in deny^ng to give the just price, in not restoring the
thing hired whole again, and at the due time, or in circumventing his creditor
by dissembling or concealing his own debts Hither belongs the sin of stell
ona^e or couznage* when one sel^ or pawns that which is alr^ady pawned or
morgaged to another.
.

Here fitly we may speak of Usury, which is the fruit that the thing Let or lent
brings in to the Letter o^ lender.

The RULES.
I. Usury is either lawful or satisfac^orie, or unlawful and only gainful or
lucratorie

II. Lawful is known by the object, end, and manner thereof.

III. The object of usurie, is, man so well to pass in his estate, as that he
is able to recompense in some measure his creditor.

IV. The end, is a respec^ to a man's own gain, and the help of his neighbor.

V. The manner is, that the lender may be moved with charity, and the borrower
with justice and honesty, to acknowledge the good turn received, and hi^
thank^ulnessly retribution.

VI. If these conditions be observed, Usury cannot be reproved.

(...) and simply is not unlawful, is apparent* Because if is were si^ply
unlawful God had not suffered the Jews to take use of strangers, Deuteronomy. 23 20.
2. Because if Lands, Houses, Horses and such like may b^ let for b^n^fit, why
may not money also* It Is true, that God would not have Use raised upon the
fru^t^ of the Lan^* of Canaan; but that was a part of the Ceremonial Law; so he
would not have the Lands thereof sold, but to return to the owners, L^v. 25.23.

VII. Unlawful Usury, is, which is practiced on the poor, or for gain merely,
having no regard to charity and equity.

This Usurie is called by the Hebrew^ Naeschaech from biting o^ gnawing, and ^t
^s most severely forbid, Exodus 22.25. If thou lend money to any of my people
that is poor by thee, thou shall not be to him as an usurer, nor shall thou ^ay
upon him usurie. Psa. 15.5. Who has not lent his money upon usurie. Ezekiel. 18.8
He has not given forth upon u^u^y, neither has he taken any increase. Luke
6.35 Lend, looking for nothing again.

Justice in the custody of things, is, whereby equity is observed in remanding
and restoring of Pawns or Pledges.

Exodus 22.7. If a man shall deliver to his neighb^ur money or st^ff ^o k^ep and
it be sto^^n out of the man's house if the theif be found, let him pay double*
if the theif be not found, th^n the Master of the house shall he brought unto
the Iudge^ to see w^ether he has not put his hand to his neighbors goods. The
same Law follows, ver. 10 11. concerning the Ass, Ox, and small Cattle: he
that receives a Pawn, let him take heed he do not receive on^ of a poor body,
or retain that pawn which the poor man cannot be without, Exo. 22.26. If thou
take thy neighbors raim^nt to pledge, thou shall deliver it to him by that the
Sun goe^h down, for that is his covering only: Deuteronomy. 24.6. No man shall take
the nether or upper M^^stone ^o pledge for he takes a man's l^fe to ple^g, and
verse. 10. when thou do lend thy brother any thing, thou, sha^t not go into
his house to fetch his pledge, thou sha^t stand abroad, and the man to whom
thou do lend shall bring out the pledge abroad to thee. Ezekiel. 18*7. And has
not oppressed any, but ha^h restored to the debtor his pledge.

So much of Justice; Beneficence is, whereby we help our neighbor with our
means freely. This virtue is called liberality, in lesser gifts; in greater,
Magnificence: in relation to the poor, alms: to banished men and strangers,
hospitality.

To this the Scripture invites us, 1 By command, Luke. 6.38. Give, etc. 2. By
the example of holy men, yea of God himself, who is the Fountain of all
goodness, Luke 6.36. Be you merciful as your father is merciful. 3. By most
sweet promises Luke. 6 38. Give and (...) shall be given to you, etc.
Especially by promising life ete^al, Matthew. 25.34, 35 Come ye blessed of my
Father, etc. I was ^ung^y and ye gave me food, etc.

To this is opposite the neglect of bounty, as also baseness, hard-heartednesse,
and unseasonable bounty, etc.

See above, cap. 8.

So much of Virtues as they have reference to others; the virtues which have
respect to our selves, are, Contentation, Parsimonie, and Industry.

(...), or Contentation, is a Virtue whereby man contents himself with his own
condition, and with the estate which he has justly got. 1 Timothy 6 6. Godliness is
great gain with con^entment.

To this is opposite unbelieving care concerning the sustaining of this life
Th^s is excellently refuted by that famous Sermon of Christ's, Mat 6.25, etc.
, covetousness Covetousness is far worse than excessive care; for a covetous
man the more he has, the more he desires and heaps: therefore this vice which
is called (...) a desire or heaping up of too much, and (...) the love of money
is to be avoided, 1. Because ^t is forbid by Christ, Luke. 12 ^5 B^wa^e of
covetousness. 2. Because it is idolatry, Matthew. 6.24. and Col. 3.5. and Ephesians. 5
15. 3. Because it is the root of all evil, 1 Timothy 6.1^.
, and a loathing of ones present condition. Jude v.16. These are murmurers,
complainers, But Paul knew how to want, and how to abound, Phil. 4 12. Heb.
13.5.


Parsimonie or frugality is a virtue whereby we so moderate our expenses, that
we spend not but what is needful and reserve the remainder for future uses.

We must aim at this, 1. Because commanded, Joh. 6.12. Gather up the fragments
that remain, that noth^ng be lost. 2. Because ^t is a remedy against poverty,
and a mean to exercise our bounty.

To this are opposite too much sparing, and profuseness.

Industry or love of labor, or the care of getting means honestly, is a Virtue
whereby one gets an estate by honest labors, that he may be the better enabled
to live comfortably to himself, and to others.

This was enjoined in Parad^se, Genesis 3 19. the same is commended by Paul, Ephesians
4.28. He that st^^e* let him steal no mo^e, but rather let him labor, working
with his hands the things that is good* that he may have to g^ve to him that
(...).

To this are opposite, Idleness, and a disordered life, dishonest ways of
gaining, Usury, Dice, Mercenarie soldiery, and other ways of getting wealth
by right and wrong.

See what is said of the idle, Prove. 6.1. etc. and 12.11 and Eccl. 4.1, 2. The
rest appear out of what is said before.

CHAP. XIII. Of Virtue and Works belonging to the Ninth Commandment.
HAving spoken of our duty toward our own, and neighbors estate, now follows
that we speak of our duty toward our own, and neighbors fame; in the ninth
precept. The sum whereof is, that we preserve our own, and neighbors fame,
and good name.

This precept is negative, and Synecdochical, for under the phrase of false
witness, is understood every thing whereby our own, and neighbors fame or
estimation is hurt, hence is collected an affirmative precept, That we study to
preserve our own, and our neighbors fame.

The virtues of this precept are also twofold; some have relation to our
neighbor, some to our selves; those which have respect to our neighbor, are
truth and sincerity; Truth it is a virtue whereby we are bent to know those
things that be true, and to utter or signify the things known, as they are.

Zach. 8.16. Ephesians. 4.25. Let every man speak truth to his neighbor.

To these in the defect are opposite, the neglect of truth Psa. 58.4. etc.
Their poison is like the p^yson of a Serpent, like the d^af* Adder that
stops his ^ars.
, and naughty dissembling Not every dissimulation is culpable, for we are not
forced still to speak the truth, as shall appear in what follows; but that
dissimulation is understood, when we conceal the truth to the prejudice of Gods
glory, and of our neighbor.
; but in the excess, lying A lie is, when a false thing is signified by words
or deeds, with a purpose to deceive. By this definition it appears, 1 That
Schemes, Metaphor^, Allegories, and such like are not lies, seeing the truth of
them depends not from fictions, but from the similitude they have with true
things; the same reason is of Ironies, which are used not to deceive, but to
instruct, such were used by El^jah, 1 King 18 and by Micaiah, 1 King 22.2. That
it is one thing to speak an untruth, another to lie; for one may speak an
untruth* by relating other men's sayings, or by speaking that which he thinks to
be true; but he lies, who utters a falsehood either by word or gesture, or any
other way purposely to deceive. 3. That dissembling, deceits, and stratagems in
War are not lies, so there be not perfi^iousnesse and perjury j^yned, The
distinction of lies into officious, jocond, and pernicious; sh^wes only th^s,
that one lie is more grievous then another; however no lie is excusable, but by
all means must be avoided, both because its most severely forbid by God, who is
Truth it self, Zach. 8 16. as also because it is a diabolical sin, Ioh. 8.44.
to whom the punishment must be added that is prepared for liers Psalm. 5.6. Thou will destroy the^ that speak lies
, and false witness A false witness is made either out of the place and time
of judicature, or in judgment, by the judge, or by the parties in suite, or by
the Lawyers, or by else witness^s. Concerning which God has made a most severe
Law^, Deuteronomy. 19.16 etc. If a false witn^sse rise up against any man to testify
against him that which is wrong, then both the men between whom the con^roversy
is shall stand before the Lord, before the Priests and Judges that shall be in
those days; and the Judges shall make diligent anquisition, and behold, if the
witness shall b^ a false witness; and has testified fa^sly against his
brother, then shall ye do to him, as he thought to have done to his brother,
etc.
.

Sincerity is a virtue whereby we deal plainly and ingenuously with our
neighbor, acknowledging Gods gifts in him Phil. 2 3. In lowlines of mind ^et
each esteem others better than themselves.
, taking in good part his sayings and doings 1 Cor. 13 7. Charity believes all
things, hops all things,
, not giving rash credit to doubtful evils in him 1 Cor. 13 5. Charity thinks
not evil.
, but concealing his known evils Pro. 10 12. Hatred stirs up strife, bu^
love covere^h all sins.
, or making the best construction of then Mat. 7.1. Judge not best ye be judged
etc.
.

To this diverse sins are opposite; to wit, evil suspicions 1 Timothy 6 4. Whereof
comes envy, strife, rai^ings, evil surmisings, etc. examples are in Eli 1 Samuel
2. in Saul, 1 Samuel 22. in Han^n and Courtiers, 2 Sa. 10. in the people of
Melita, Act. 28.
, curiosity in prying into our neighbors faults, not out of any desire to amend
them, but to calumniate Luke 6.14. What do thou seek the mo^e that is in thy
brothers eye, but do not observe the beam that is in thine own eye?
, calumnies themselves Calumnies arise either by spreading lies of our
neighbor, Exodus 23 1. Thou shall not raise a falls report: put not thine hand
with the wicked to be an unrightous witness; or, by making a malicious
constr^ction of our neighbors words and deeds, Matt* 26 61. This fellow said, I
can destroy the temple of God, and raise it up again in three days: or, by
speaking the truth, but purposly to hurt our neighbor, 1 Samuel 22.9 Then
Answered Do^g the Edomite, which was set over Saul's servants, and said, I saw
the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Abimilech the son of Ahitub; and he
enquired of the Lord for him, and he gave him victuals; and the sword of Goliath
the Philistine. Basil says well, that a calumniator hurts three persons at one
time: for he wrongs the party whom he calumniates; h^ wrong^ the hea^ers by
possessing them with a lie, and he wounds his own conscience: So Bernard to the
same purpose says, The calumniator or backbiter, and the hearer, both of them
have the Devil, the one in his tongue the other in his ears.
, and flattery Prove. 27.6 Faithful are the wounds of a friend, but the kiss of
an enemy are deceip^full.
.

To Truth and Sincerity; as to the chief virtues, are subservient, Faith,
Gravity, Silence, Gentleness, Courtesy, and Freedom of speech.

Faith or fidelity is, a constancy in our words and deeds.

This is called sincerity Ephesians. 4 15. Carrying your selves sincerely in love,
for so the word (...) is translated by the best Interpreters.

To this is opposite the double tongue, when a man speaks one thing, and thinks
or does another Psalm. 12.2. Truth has failed amongst the children of men; they
speak vanity one to another, they flatter with then tongue, and dissemble with
a double ^eart
: Imprudent simplicity when a thing is rashly promised, before the matter be
sufficiently tried Mat. 26.35 Peter says to him, although I die with thee, yet
will I not deny thee: in like manner said all the Disciples
: also counterfeit simplicity and fidelity Mat. 2.8 Make enqui^y (...) the
child* and when you have found him ^et me know, that I may come and wo^ship him
also.
.

Gravity is, w^h utters nothing but what is wel^ weighed, savoring of
Christian wisdom, and tending to edification.

Col. 4.6. Let your speech be seasoned with grace and salt, that you may know
how to answer every man.

Opposite to this, is idle prattling See a notable place for b^idling the
tongue, Iam 3.2. etc.
, foolish speaking Ephe^ 4.29. Let no corrupt communication proceed ou^ of your
mouth. 1 Cor. 2. And I breth^en, when I came unto you, I came not with entising
words etc.
, and counterfeit gravity.

Silence is a virtue which faithfully conceals secrets committed to it.

Mat* 18 15, But if thy brother trespass against thee, go and reprove him
between thee and him alone.

To this is opposite, perfidiousness, whereby secrets are revealed Prove. 11.13.
He that goes about as a slanderer, discovers a secret, but he that is of a
faithful heart, concealeth the matter, I his virtue becomes all men, but
chiefly Ministers, left the secrets committed to their breast be rashly
div^l^ed except they be such secrets as may tend to the hurt of the Church, or
State, for in that case greater regard must be had of unity, the^ of one man.
and naughty silence, whereby things are concealed that should not be concealed
2 Kin. 7 7. Then said the one t^ the other, we do not well, this is a day of
good tidings, and do we hold our peac^?
.

Gentleness is a virtue, whereby we show our selves affable.

1 Pet. 3 8. Finaly, be ye all of one mind, one suffer with another, love as
breth^en, be pitiful, be courteous.

To this is opp^site Peevishness Luc. ^8.4. And there was a certain widow in
that town, which came to the Judge, saying; do me justice against my adversary,
but he would not for a time.
, and counterfeit gentleness 2 Samuel 15.3.4. etc. Then Absolon said to him,
see, thy ma^ters are good and righteous, but there is no man deputed of the
King to hear thee. Absolon said moreover, O that I were made Judge in the land
that every man, which has any matter of controversy might come to me that I
might do him justice; And when any man came near to him, and did him
obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.
.

Courtesy in speech, is whereby our words are seasoned with honest mirth, and
wit, with a good decorum or grace.

To this is opposite, Rusticity, when one can neither utter witty jests
himself, nor with patience hear them: Scurrility also, and Dicacitie or biting
jests and scoffs.

Ephesians. 5.4. Neither fil^hinesse, no^ foolish talking nor jesting, which are
things not comely,

Freedom of speech, is a virtue by which we speak the truth, and reprove
offenders without fear of danger.

Levit. 19.17 Thou shall not hate thy brother in thy heart, but thou shall
plainly rebuke thy neighbor, and suffer him not to sin.

To this is opposite preposterous fear 1 Samuel 3.15. Samuel was afraid to tell
Eli of that Vision.
, and too great love of censuring others Luk 6.41 Why do thou look upon the
mote that is in thy brothers eye; This vice is seen in them, who censure and
reprove their neighbor out of preposterous affection, or having no warant
thereto. What is fit in this case for Ministers, may be seen in 2 Timothy 4.1, 2.
.

So much of virtues, as they have reference to our neighbor: the virtues that
have relation to our selves, are self-praise and an unblameable life,
self-praise is, when we speak moderately of our selves, and rehearse our own
praises only when necessity urges us to defend and maintain our own
estimation.

Romans 12.3. For I say by the grace given to me to every man that is among you,
not to think of himself more highly then he ought to think, but to think
soberly, etc.

To this impudency is opposite, when one is not ashamed to boast and glory in
his wickedness Isa. 3.9. The show of their countenance does witness against
them that they declare their sin (...) Sodom, they hide it not,
, so is confident and foolish bragging Pro. 27.1. Boast not thy self of to
morrow, for thou know, not what a day may bring forth, and v. 2. Let another
praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a stranger, and not thine own lips
; and an Hypocritical lessening of our own worth and abilities, under show of
which, either we hunt after vain praise, or refuse to be bountiful, and to
show mercy so they do, who pretend they are in want themselves, when they are
desired to help their neighbor* Pro 24.11. If thou forbear to deliver them
that are drawn unto death, etc. if thou say, behold we knew it not: does not
be that pondereth the heart consider it?
.

An unblameable life, is, whereby we desire not only to keep a good conscience
toward God, but also a good report among our neighbors.

Pro. 22.1. A good name is rather to be chosen then great riches, and loving
favor rather then silver and gold. Eccl. 7.1. A good name is better then
precious ointment.

To this, Impiety is opposite, or the contempt of fame, and a good conscience
Luk* 18.2. There was a Judge in a certain city which feared not God, nor
regarded man.
; and the hypocritical affections of fame or popular breath Matt. 23.5. But
they do all their works for to be seen of men.
; and want of patience in bearing slanders 2 Samuel 16.9, 10 Then said Abishai why
should this dead dog curse my Lord the King? let me go over, I pray thee, and
take off his head Then the King said, what have I to do with you, ye sons of
Zerviah? so let him curse, Because the Lord had said unto him, curse David* who
shall then say, wherefore have thou done so?
.

CHAP. XIV. Of Virtues and Works belonging to the tenth Commandment.
HItherto of our duty to our neighbor, or of the parts of Gods mediate worship.
Now of the highest degree thereof in this tenth precept.

The sum of it is, that our mind be free from evil desires, thoughts, and
affections toward our selves, or neighbors.

Thou shall not covet] is a negative precept, in which inordinate appetites,
thoughts* and affections are forbid The rest conduce to the declaration taken
from the object, which is set down either particularly, by naming the house,
wife, servant, maid, ox and ass of our neighbor; or in gross in this clause
Nor any thing that belongs unto thy neighbor.

The RULES.
I. As the confounding of the two first Commands is unlawful; so the dividing
of the tenth into two precepts, concerning our neighbors house, and his wife,
is naught and frivolous.

The reasons 1* The general closure, Nor any thing that belongs to thy
neighbor, shows it is but one command. 2. The substance of the precept is in
these words, Thou shall not covet: as Paul cit^s them, Romans 7.7. 3. They are
contained in one verse and sentence, whereas the rest, tho short are set down
in distinct verses 4. Deuteronomy. 5. the coveting of our ne^ghbours wife, is first
handled: if then these were two precepts, Moses of the tenth had made the
ninth. 5. They who maintain the contrary opinion, explain these things
conjunctly and by examples declare them. David Chytraeus de R^gulis Vitae, and
Hondorfius in Promptua^io.

II. The tenth Command belongs to the second Table.

For in the first Command of the first Table is handled our inward affe^^ion
toward God.

III. Orginal Justice is the object, not of this Command, but of the whole
Decal^gue.

(...) original justice is a conformity with the (...) law; as orignal sin is
that deformity which is repugnant to the whole law.

IV The proper object of this precept are men's appetites, thoughts, and
affections toward themselves, and neighbor.

V* The end of it is, to show that Gods mediate worship is to be performed, not
in outward actions only, but in inward affections also.

VI. As then the first precept, is the line or rule of the first Table so is
this of the second Table.

For as the first precept directs the heart* but the rest the actions also; so
the fifth, sixth, seventh* e^ghth, ninth Precepts order our actions but the
tenth ou^ very heart, Hence it is clear, that this Precept is not superfluous.

The virtue; belonging to this precept, are, the ordering of concupiscence, and
our wrestling against evil desires.

The ordering of concupiscence is, whereby our appetites and affections are so
ruled, that by them we neither offend against our selves, nor against our
neighbor.

1 Thessalonians. 5.23. Now the God of peace, sanctify you throughout, etc,

To this is opposite inordinate concupiscence, which in Scripture by way of
excellency is called Concupiscence.

Romans 7.7. For I had not known concupiscence, if the Law had not said Thou
shall not lust.

The parts of this ordering are two; The one is employed about the appetits,
the other about the affections.

This word concupiscence, among Divines is taken in a large sense, both for the
appetites and affections; of which the former are ascribed to man, as he is a
sensitive creature, but the latter, as he is a man, But by Philosophers it is
taken more strictly; so that they reduce the inferior appetites to the
concupiscible faculty, but the affections to the irascible.

Ordered appetites are, whereby man desires meat, drink, rest, sleep and such
like, moderately, and to the end appointed by God.

1 Timothy 5.23. Drink no longer water but use a little wine for thy stomachs sake
and often infirmities.

To this is opposite, Inordinat appetite, whereby more is desired than nature,
or Gods ordination do require, or for another end than that, to which God has
ordained natural things lawful.

Romans 13.13. Not in su^feting and drunkene^^ not in chambering and wantonness.

The chief affections, are, Love, Hatred Joy, Sadness, Hope, Fear, and Anger.

Ordered Love, is, whereby we sincerely love our neighbor, and desire the
things that be good, fair and of good report.

Romans 12.9. Let love be without dissimulation: Abbor that which is evil, cleave
to that which is good, Phil.4.8 whatsoever things are true, whatsoever thimgs
are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure etc. if
there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.

To this is opposite, the too much love of our nighbour 1 Samuel 2.29. Thou have
honored thy sons above me.
, self-love 2 Timothy 3.2. Men will be lovers of themselves,
, impure love Prove. 6.25. Desire not her beauty neither let her eyelids entice
thee.
, and the love of this world 1 John 2.15. Love not the world, etc And v. 16.
Because whatsoever is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the
eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but of the world.
.

Ordered hatred is, whereby we only hate those who hate God Psalm. 139.21. Do
not I hate them, O Lord, that hate thee, Mat. 18 15 If thy brother offend thee
reprove him between thee and him alone, etc. Ro^ 7.19. For I do not the good
which I would, but the evil which I would not do, that do I.
; in other men, and in ourselves, we hate not the person, but by all means we
hate and avoid the sin b.

To this is opposite the unjust hatred of our neighbor 1 John 3.15. whosoever
hates his brother is a murderer.
, and the hatred of good men Psalm. 41.5 My enemies said of me, when shall he
die, etc.
.

Ordered joy is, whereby man rejoices moderately for his own prosperity Psalm.
30.12. Thou have turned my mourning into joy,
, and heartily for his neighbor felicity To. 12.15. Rejoice with them that
rejoice.
.

To this is opposite, carnal, and immoderat joy Luke 6.25. Woe to you that now
laugh, for you shall weep and mourn.
, also re^oycing at our neighbors misfortunes or calamities. Prove. 24.17.
Rejoice not at thy enemies fall.
.

Ordered sadness or sorrow is, whereby we moderately bemoan our own afflictions
Ja. 5.13. Is any among you afflicted, let him pray.
, and heartily condole our neighbors calamities To. 12.15. mourn with those
that mourn.
.

To this, Immoderate sadness is opposite Prove. 17.22. A (...) heart does good
like a medicine, but a broken ^pi^it dries the bones
, sadness also for our neighbors prosperity Mat. 20 15. Is thy eye ^vil because
I am good?
, and too much sadness when wicked men are punished 1 Samuel 16.1. How long will thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him etc.
.

Ordered hope is, whereby we expect better things for our selves, and by the
^aw of charity also for our neighbors.

Of hope as it is a ver^ue; we have spok^n before. 1 Cor. ^3.7 Love suffers
all things, believes all things, hops all things* etc. Phil. 1 7.

To this is opposite disordered hope, when we place more trust in our selves,
and neighbors than is fit.

Je^ 17.5 Cursed is he that puts his trust in man

Ordered fear is, whereby we walk carefully, neither trusting too much our
selves, or others.

Prove. 14 8. The wisdom of the (...) to understand his way.

To this is opposite disordered fear, whereby man fears himself and others too
much.

Mat 10.28. Fear not them that can kill (...) body, etc.

Ordered anger is, whereby we are offended or displeased with our selves or
others, upon ^ust cause, yet moderately, and with hope of amending.

Ephesians. 4.26. Be angry but sin not.

To this is opposite inordinate anger, whereby we are incensed upon light
causes, or more than is fit; or when we intend private revenge.

Jam 1.20. For the wrath of man works not the righteousness of God.

So much of the ordering of concupiscence. Wrestling against tentations, and
the assaults of an evil conscience, is, whereby a Christian man denies an evil
conscience, crucifying his flesh with the lusts thereof; and against the
assaults of the flesh, the devil and the world, watches and stoutly fights.

There are many reasons that induce us, to wrestle stoutly, 1. Because the
Scripture forbids evil desires and lusts, Prove. 6.25 1 Cor. 10.6. Gal. 5.16, ^6
Col. 3.5 1 These 4 ^. 2 Because he that is given to lust^* loves nor God, 1 Ioh
2 15, 16. 3 Because lusts in regenerate men a^e hateful, 2 Gal. 5.16 17. 4.
Because they stir up the wrath of God, Col. 3. v. 5, 6. 5. Because the Apostle
furn^sheth us with the whole armor of God against them, Ephesians 6 Invisible lusts
are ove^come by us, says Austin. 6. Because the fi^e of lusts is most
hu^tfull, and breaks out into most sad events; Sc^ipture is full of examples;
there was never yet any sin committed, which did not spring ^^om evil lust.

To this, is opposite carnal security, whereby man flatters his own flesh;
whereby he willingly entertaineth lusts, whereby he gives himself to idleness,
and sloth, which is the devils cushion, whereby he omits holy exercises,
whereby he burdens his soul with intemperance, covetousness, and such like
vices.

There are three de^rees of our wrestling against lusts; to wit, against
suggestion, delight, and assent.

To understand these degrees, that of James helps, c. 1.14. etc. Every man is
tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust, and en^iced; then when lust has
conceived, it brings forth sin; and sin when it is fin^shed, b^ingeth forth
death. We must then first resist suggestions and thoughts which are either
ascending from the fuel of concup^scence or descending being suggested
elsewhere: the first are not without sin; the latter are not sins, being cast in
by Satan if so ^e we let them pass, and entertain them not. But if we cannot
avoid the first degree; let u^ shun the second, lest we come to cherish evil
thoughts with delight. But we must chiefly beware of the third degree, that we
give not our assent. For the more we obey the sin of concupiscence, the more
it increases. Which that we may more and more avoid, w^ beseech God the
Father, in his Son, through the holy Ghost, to which one God in Trinity, he
praise, honor and glory, for ever and ever. Amen.
