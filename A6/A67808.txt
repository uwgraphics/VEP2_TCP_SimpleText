Crooked PATHS Made STRAIGHT: OR, The ways of God made known to lost
Sinners, or bewildered SAINTS. Wherein is represented the several conditions
of a Christian in the Spirit, as he grows up out of weakness into strength,
through death into life eternal. By ANNE YEMANS.

Isa. 40.3. The voice of him that cries in the wilderness, prepare ye the way
of the Lord, make straight in the desert a high way for our God.

To the READER.
Gentle Reader,
I Have done mine endeavor to set forth unto you in some measure the bondage
that we have been in by sin, the Devil, and false Teachers, what wounds we
have received by them: and all has been, because we have not been able to
discern the difference between the ways of God, and Antichrist: And the more
we strive and struggle in our own strength, the more we are wounded; while
Jesus Christ does appear to us to reveal some light of himself to us: and he
is that Son of righteousness that will appear to us with healing in his
wings, Mal. 4.2. He will reveal his love to us, and heal up all our wounds,
and lead us in the way that we should walk, taking us by the hand, and leading
us gently as we are able to go, and drawing us with the cords of love. Most of
the children of God have been in this spiritual bondage: and those that have
been in it, and are brought out of it, does know in some measure how to comfort
them that are in it: and the Lord does make us many times isntrumental under
himself for th comfort and edifying one of another: but it is Gol that does
make known all things to us, whether it be by means, or without, and we ought
to give him all the honor; it is very dangerous to idolize the means, neither
ought we to slight it, thougo it be by never so mean a person; For out of the
mouth of babes will he be praised. And let not us undervalue any thing that is
of God, whosoever it be spoken by; for God is no respecter of persons. I
beseech you beloved let not this my labor seem odious to you, nor caus^ you
to slight i^, because it is written by a weak woman; nor for you to harbor any
strange thoughts of me for the writing of it; for I have my self gon^ through
much spiritual bondage in several ways and finding many several turns and
windings of Satan, how cunning he is in all his ways, an^ transforming
himself to an Angel of light, and labors our destruction in all things. And
the Lord having brought me out of that bondage, into tha^ spiritual freedom
which is in Christ for all the Saints: and I seeing many that are yet in
spirit^^ all bondage, and knows not what freedom there (...) in Christ for
them, it does cause my bowels of affection to yern to them. Yet I should not
presume (...) set forth this in writing, but that I have been exceedingly
moved by the Spirit of God to do i^ that I could not be quiet till I had begun
it. I ha^^ done what I could before I did begin to do it to p^^ those thoughts
out of my mind, bringing as many objections against it as I could: but still
the Spirit of God moved me more and more, with motives to stir me up to do
it, and many promises for the enabling of me to do it, knocking all the
objections in pieces that came against it: and this was one thing that was laid
before me. When thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren. And if thou love
me, feed my Lambs, Ioh. 21.15. And another was, I am no respecter of persons.
And also if we are the children of God, we must be led by the Spirit of God, to
do what he would have us: but after I saw it was of God, I durst not refuse
to do it; for obedience is better than sacrifice, 1 Samuel 15.22. For I plainly
see how dearly God loves all mankind, but especially his children, and those
that are babes in Christ; how great his love to them is, yea even those that
Christ is but newly conceived in. If there be but a desiring really after God,
though there be yet no enjoyment of God, he will not quench smoking fl^xe:
and his love is as great to those that are the lowest and weakest Saints, as to
those that are the highest and strongest; only he makes his love known more
to them than to those that are yet weak: and his making his love known to us,
causes us to grow strong in him: We all were weak at the first, but be
strengthens us by degrees as he reveals himself to us more and more, and so
be will do to you: and when he does reveal any thing to any, it is not only
for them, bit that they should declare i^ unto others, that they may know what
love Go^ has toward them, that our weak brethren man he strengthened, and the
lambs of God (which are the young children of God) may be fed (...) and the
doing of this aright is exceeding pleasin^ to God. Here is one sign of our
love to God: an^ after we have found our Beloved, all our desire should be,
that we should be led wholly by the Spirit of God to glorify him, and setting
forth hi^ praise, and not to fear the scandals and reproaches o^ the world,
which are like thorns springing u^ by the Devil, laboring to choke the pur^
truth of Christ: but I pass not what scandals o^ reproaches I meet with all
by this book settin^ forth; for truth does always find some great enemies,
and the more, because it is written by a woman; for there are some always that
do respect the persons of people, having men's persons in admiration, Jude 16.
My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ the Lord of gl^ry,
with respect of persons, Ja. 2.1. And (...) shall come to pass in the last days
(says God^ I will pour of my spirit upon all fish, and you sons and your
daughters shall prophecy, and you young men shall see visiions, and your old me
shall dream dreams, and on my servant, an on my hand-maidens I will pour out in
tho^ days of my spirit, and they shall prophecy, Joel 2.28. Act. 2.17, 18.
When the children of Israel murmured for flesh to eat, and Moses was not able
to bear it, the Lord bid him gather seventy men of the Elders of the people:
and the Lord toook off ^he spirit that was upon Moses and put upon them, and
when the spirit rested upon them, then they prophesied, and did not cease: and
there was two ^f that seventy that went not out of the Host, and they also
prophesied. Then there ran a young man and told Moses, and said, Eldad and
Medad do prophecy in the host. And there was one answered and said, My Lord
Moses forbid them: but Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? Yea,
would to God that all the Lords people were Prophets, and that the Lord would
put his Spirit upon them, Number. 11. Here is the spirit taken off of Moses, which
was a type of Christ, and then ^hey prophesied and ceased not. Truly friends,
when the Lord does put that Spirit of Christ upon us, then we shall speak forth
the things of God; for we cannot but speak the things that we have seen, and
^eard, and enjoyed, and let none be found to des^ise the things of God. I have
here set forth to you the way of God as plain as I am able, showing you the
subtilty of the Devil in all his ways, and how like the ways of God many of his
ways are: but the Spirit of God in us doeh discern the difference, and ^e will
reveal himself in us by degrees, that as we are Saints, we shall see, know,
and enjoy him, whom our soul loves, and wait with patience while he^ does
manifest himself to you. And I beseech you read this over with patience, and
the Lord give you understanding. I have shown you the bondage that we have been
led in in the first place: and then in the next place what Christ has done for
all, and how he is offered to all: And in the third place, what he has done
for his Children, and what they are in him and to him: and ye may see what
difference there is between being led on in a legal way, and being led by the
Spirit of God. I have beginn in the lowest way as I could, showing you by
degrees the mysteries of God for your better understanding. And if there be any
thing in it that seems to you not to be truth, yet despise it not before you
know whether it be or no; Neither would I have you embrace for a truth while it
is made clear to you to be a truth: but wait upon God for him to reveal his
mind to you: and if the Lord be pleased to crown my labor by his Spirit
working with it, upon any of you, it will be my joy, for God to be glorified,
and for you to be benefited. The which I shall heartil^ pray for, and remain

Yours in the Lord. Anne Yemans.

SAINTS.
CHAP. I. The poor soul lying under the burden of sin, is wishing to be
eased.
WHen the Lord comes and manifests himself to us, that he has sowed the seeds
of himself in us, which is the good seed, spoken of in Mat. 13.3. Then
immediately the Tares appear, which is sin and wickedness; then there is a
crying out, Men and Brethren, what shall we do, Acts 3.38. and 19. 16. Master,
what good thing shall I do, th^^ I may have eternal life: but while we are
thinking of doing something for eternal life, the^ comes Satan's enditements
against us, an^ lays our sins before us, and tells us what Rebels we have been
against the King of Heaven and he brings the condemning power of the Law
before them: Cursed is every one that dot^ not all things that is written in
the Book; An^ also in Deuteronomy. 28.12. And it shall come to pass^^ if thou shall
hearken diligently unto the voice (...) the Lord thy God, to observe and do
all his Commandments which I command thee this day, tha^ the Lord thy God will
set thee on high above a (...) Nations on the Earth: And all these blessing
shall come on thee: and overtake thee, if tho^ shall hearken unto the voice of
the Lord the God. Blessed shall thou be in the City, and blessed in the field,
etc. But thou finding that tho^ have not done it, then the the 15. and 1^
verses of this Chapter, and so along: But (...) shall come to pass, if thou will not hearken unt^ the voice of the Lord thy God, to observe to do a^ his
Commandments, that all these curses com^ upon thee, and overtake thee; Cursed
shall the be in the City, and cursed shall thou be in t^^ field. And so going
along, threatening curs^ for thy disobedience: and all places of Scripture that
is suitable to this, is laid before thee and then thou being sore perplexed, to
think how thou have walked contrary to the mind of God, and that he is angry
with thee for thy sins, and all the curses of God belong unto thee, and hell
and damnation gapes for thee: then thou bethinkst thy self of the gracious
call of Christ, Mat. 11.28. Come unto me all ye that labor, and are heavy
laden, and I will give you rest. Then thou bethinkest thy self to go to the
Lord by repentance, that so thou may have rest; then these places of
Scripture sets thee on repentance, Ezekiel. 18.21. But if the wicked will return
from all his sins that he has committed, and keep all my statutes, and do
that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not dye. And
verse. 30. Repent and turn your selves from all your transgressions, so
iniquity shall not be your ruin: and verse. 31. to the end of the chapter. Cast
away from you all your transgressions whereby you have transgressed me, and
make you a new heart, and a new spirit; For, why will you dye O house of
Israel? for I have no pleasure in the death of him that dies says the Lord
God; wherefore turn your selves, and live ye. And Jer. ^.12. Return thou
backe-sliding Israel (says the Lord) and I will not cause mine anger to fall
upon ^ou; for I am merciful (says the Lord,) and I will not keep anger for
ever. And Jer. 4.1. If ^hou wilt return O Israel (says the Lord) return unto
me? and if thou will put away thy abominations out of my sight, then shall
thou not remove And verse. 14. O Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness that
thou may be saved; how long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee. Hos
14.10. O Israel return unto the Lord thy God for thou have fallen by thine
iniquity: And the^ he says, verse. 4. I will heal their backsliding I will
love them truly: for my anger is turned aw^^ from them, Prove. 1.23. Turn you
at my reproof Behold I will pour out my Spirit unto you, I will make known my
words unto you. Isa. 1.16.13 Wash you, make you clean, put away the evil
(...) your doings from before my eyes. Cease to do evil learn to do well,
seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the
widdom.

So here you see there is a repentance calle^ for, not only a repenting for the
sins that i^ past, but a returning from thy evil ways and doing that is
pleasing in his sight. An^ v^rs. 18. Come now, and let us reason together says
the Lord; when thou have done this a^^gh^ then there is free passage for thee
to go to the Lord, and he will reason with thee; Thouh^ you^ sins be as
scarlet, they shall be as white (...) snow; though they be red like crimson,
they shall (...) as wool. If ye be willing and obedient, ye sh^^ eat the good
of the Land: but if ye refuse and reb^^ ye shall be devoured with the sword,
for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it. And so he goes along proffering mercy
to them that are thus qualified, Psalm. 147.3. He heals the broken in heart,
and binds up their wounds. Mal. 3.7. Return unto me, and I will return unto
you, says the Lord of Hosts. Joel 2.12, 13. Therefore also now says the Lord,
turn ye even to me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping,
and with mourning, and rend your hearts and not your garments, and turn unto
the Lord your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of
great compassion, and repents him of the evil. Luke 13.3. But except ye
repent, ye shall all likewise perish.

And seeing the Lord calls upon thee for repentance, and proffers thee a pardon
through thy obedience: thou art resolved to set thy self upon repentance and
obedience.

CHAP. II. How Satan comes with his Enditements against us by our works of
the Law.
When thou art thus resolved to set thy self to walk in the ways of God,
thinking thy self to be in a good way now: then comes Satan and tells thee,
it is true, the Lord is very merciful and gracious to them that truly repent:
but thy repentance is not a true repentance, for thou art not sufficiently
humbled for thy sins; for great sins must have great repentance, and many
sins must have much repentance. Look upon David and Peter, whether thy
repentance be like theirs; if it be, thou will be careful for fear of falling
into the like sins again: but thou daily fallest into the same sins again,
Mat. 7.21. Not every one that says, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom
of heaven, but he that does the will of my Father which is in heaven. Heb. 6.4,
5, 6. For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted
of the heavenly gifts, and were made partakers of the holy Ghost: And have
tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come; if they shall
fall away, to renew them again to repentance, seeing they crucify to
themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to open shame. Heb. 10.26, 27,
28, 29. For if we sin wilfully after we have received the knowledge of the
truth, there remains no more sacrifice: but a certain fearful looking for
of judgment and fiery indignation which shall devour the adversaries. He that
despised Moses law, dyed without mercy under two or three witnesses: Of how
much sorer punishment suppose ye shall he be thought worthy, who has trodden
under foot the Son of God, and has counted the blood of the Covenant
wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and has done despite unto the
spirit of grace. 2 Pe^. 2.20, 21, 22. For if after they have escaped the
pollutions of the world, through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus
Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome; the latter end is
worse with them than the beginning. For it had been better for them not to have
known the way of righteousness, than after they have known it, to turn from
the holy Commandment delivered unto them. But it happened to them, according
to the true proverb, the dog is returned to his own vomit again, and the sow
that was washed, to her wallowing in the mire.

Thus thou see how the Devil wounds thee with thy own righteousness; for
there is a perfect righteousness required, and perfect obedience: but thou
can not find this in thee, therefore thou art sore troubled: but sometime
thou have got some power over thy sins, and art affected with the ways of
God, that thou can go on cheerfully in thy obedience to God, and power
forth thy soul to the Lord in prayer, and findst that thy prayers are heard,
and thy petitions granted, and thy sins are pardoned: and now for present
thou have joy and comfort: and now thou art ready to say with David: I shall
never be moved.

Thus while thou art in duties and performances, thou have joy and peace: but
when thou art overcome again with the Devile temptation, and thy own
corruptions, then immediately thou art cast down again, and ready to question
that joy and peace thou had before, and say it was presumption.

Thus thou see, beloved, how thy comforts ebb and flow with thy performances.

CHAP. III. H^w poor souls are wounded by false Teachers.
When thou see thy self in this sad condition, that thou art sore
troubled on every side, for thou see God angry with thee for thy sins, and he
command thee to repent, and he will pardon thy sins: But thou sindest that thou
can not repent aright, therefore now thou can not see thy sins pardoned:
And the Lord requires obedience of thee, and sometimes thou can not perform
any obedience to him at all; for thou can do nothing bur sin, then thou art
sore troubled ^r that and other sins, thou can perform o^^dience: but thou
find that it is not such a ^^rfect obedience as is required; therefore thou
^t sore troubled that thou can not perform a right. Oh think thou, what
shall I do, ^m ignorant of the ways of God, and I do ^^t know what to do. I
will go to some Mi^sters, and tell them what a sad condition I ^n in; They are
learned men, and therefore ^^ey know the mind of God. They know how (...)
administer a word of comfort in season, ^d will tell me what I should do,
that I ^ight find God, and walk in his ways, and ^^t be thus troubled; So
thou go and tellst ^^em thy sad condition, and ask them what ^urse they
would counsel thee to take, Cant. 3. The watchmen that go about the City and
me, to whom I said, saw ye him whom my ^^le loves. If you have seen him, you
can ^^l how to describe him to me; If you have ^^ne him, you can tell me what
he is, not ^ly in himself, but what he is in the Saints, ^^d to the Saints:
and how excellent he is in ^his ways, and glorious in all works.

I have heard excellent things of him: but if ^u have seen him, you can tell
me more of ^^^m then another; therefore I pray tell me ti^gs of him; tell me
where he is, and how I ^ll find him; tell me how you found him, that I may
find him also; for he is my belo^ he is he whom my soul loves above all thi^
in the world. I count all things like drosse^ dung to him. I am exceeding sick
of love, and (...) not rest till I have found him. Cant. 5.7. watchmen that
went about the City found they smote me they wounded me.

How did they wound her, but with (...) doctrine, so do they thee; they tell
thee, Law is a Schoolmasters to bring thee to Ch^^ Gal. 3.24. They tell thee,
the law says, ^^sed are every one that continues not in all th^^ which are
written in the book of the Law, to them, Gal. 3.10. Deuteronomy. 27.26. Exodus 20.
(...) the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting t^^ niquity of the Fathers
upon the children unto third and fourth generation of them that hate And the
Lord has too pure an eye to beh^ iniquity; there is not any thing that is an^
my to God, but the Devil and sin, 1 Job. He that commits sin, is of the
Devil; for Devil sins from the beginning. And as l^^ as ye commit sin,
the Devil is your Fat John 8.44. Ye are of your Father the De^^ and the lusts
of your father you will do; and thou art the servant to the Devil. Romans 6.
Know ye not, to whom ye yield your selves serv^ to obey, his servants ye are to
whom you obey: (...) there of sin unto death, or of obedience unto ri^^ ^esse.
And verse. 20. When ye were the servants ^^n, ye were free from righteousness.
Verse. 23. (...) wages of sin is death. And if thou enter^e sin in thy
heart, the Lord will not hear (...) prayer. The Lord is the searcher of hearts,
^d he knows the wickedness of thy heart: ^d thou must give account for every
idle ^ught; therefore you must search and exa^^e you thoroughly of all your
sins, and (...) truly humbled for every sin. But many, ^en God shows them
their sins, it is too te^us to them, they cannot bear it, they ^uld fain have
comfort administered to them: ^t we have no such warrant from God, till we (...)
you thoroughly humbled for your sins: we ^^st not daube you up with untemper'd
mor^^, but do to you; as a skillful Surgeon does ^a dangerous wound, search it
to the quick: ^^d you must endanger it, if you mean to be ^red. For if we tell
you of mercy before you ^e thoroughly humbled, this will heal your ^unds
without, but they will ranckle with^^^: and that is the reason your comforts so
be and flow.

We are Christ's Ambassadors, and we must ^e the message of Christ, which is
the deli^^ring the Doctrine of Christ; and ye shall find at we preached the
Law, and Judgment, to ^ing them in to repent, Mat. 11.21, 22, 23, 24. Then he
began to upbraid the Cities where most of his mighty works were done, because
(...) repented not. Woe unto thee Chorazin, (...) unto thee Bethsaida; for if
the mighty wor^ which have been done in you, had been done in T^^ and Sidon,
they would have repented long (...) in sackcloth and ashes. But I say unto
you, shall be more tolerable for Tire and Sidon at day of judgment, than for
you. And thou (...) pernaum which art exalted unto heaven, she be brought down
to hell. For if the mighty wor^ which have been done in thee, had been done
Sodom, it would have remained until this d^^ But I say unto you, that it
shall be more tolera^ for the land of Sodom in the day of judgem^^^ than for
thee. Luke 13.3. Except ye repent, (...) shall all likewise perish.

And when you are thus thoroughly humble then there is mercy offered you, Mat.
11.2 Come unto me all ye that labor, and are heavy (...) den, and I will give
you rest. Take my yoke up you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lo^^ in
heart, and ye shall find rest for your souls; (...) my yoke is easy, and my
burden is light. Jer. 2^ 11, 12, 13. For I know the thoughts that I thi^
toward you, says the Lord; thoughts of peace a^ not of evil, to give you an
expected end. The shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray un^ me, and
I will hearken unto you. And ye sh^^ ^^eke me, and find me, when ye shall
search for ^e with all your heart. Jer. 33.8. And I will canse them from all
their iniquity whereby they ^^ve sinned against me, and whereby they have
^ansgressed against me. Psalm. 103.8, 9. 111. (...), 13. The Lord is merciful
and gracious, slow anger, and plenteous in mercy. He will not ^^wayes chide,
neither will he keep his anger for ^er. He has not dealt with us after our
sins, ^r rewarded us according to our iniquities. For (...) the heaven is
high above the earth, so great is ^s mercy to them that fear him. As far as
the ^ast is from the West, so far has he removed our ^ansgressions from us.
Like as a Father pittieth (...) children, so the Lord pittieth them that fear
^im. And verse. 3. He forgiveth all thine iniqui^^es, he heals all thy
diseases. Amo^ 5.4. Thus says the Lord unto the house of Israel, Seek (...)
me, and ye shall live. And many other pla^es of Scripture to this purpose might
be cited: ^ut these places are sufficient to show you what sad condition you
are in, so long as you con^^nue in your sins: and how merciful the Lord (...),
if you return unto him with all your heart, and be truly humbled, and walk in
a new ourse of life. Exodus 20.6. Showing mercy unto ^housands of them that love
me, and keep my Com^andements.

Thus they are able to lay open thy wounds, and make them bigger: and in stead
of p^ring in the precious balsome of the Church Christ, which will cure thy
wounds, t^ power in brine to terrify thee, and they thee upon duties, and tell
thee thou must thus and thus qualified before thou comme^ Christ: but they will
not, nor cannot thee how thou must come to be thus qualifi^^ for they will tell
thee, all thy righteousness i^ filthy rags.

When thou hear these things, thou a^^ great deal more troubled then ever
thou wa^ thou art now at thy wits end, and even rea^^ to despair; thou can
see nothing but sin: a^^ if thou could repent, and walk in a n^^^ course of
life, then there was hopes of mer^^ but thou find thou can not do it,
the^fore thou conciudest there is no mercy (...) thee, therefore thou art sore
troubled, a^^ know not what to do. Thou see the Lo^^ angry with thee for
thy sins, and think th^^ all the afflictions that comes upon thee, is (...)
judgment of the Lord for thy sins; the think thy self to be a damned
reproba^^^ quite empty of all goodness, and expect^^ daily some fearful
judgment to fall upon thee for thy sins. Oh think thou, if (...) wrath of
God lay so heavy upon Christ, the made him to cry out, My God, my God why b^^^^
(...) forsaken me: and he having no sin, Matthew. (...). 46. For if they do
these things in a green (...), what shall be done in a dry tree. Luke 23.

And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where all the sinner and ungodly
appear, 1 Pet. 4.18. ^en thou think, I shall surely be damned; ^^en the
Devil tempts thee to lay violent ^^nds on thy self, and many times thou art
^dy to do it: but that the Lord prevents it; ^^d the Ministers sees thee in
such a despairing ^^ndition, they tell thee, thou must believe ^^at the Lord
has done these and these things (...) thee: And if thou will lay hold on him
by ^^th, he will give thee grace to walk in a ^^w course of life: and yet
still they offer thee christ upon condition, and thou art excee^^ngly terrified
with hearing mercies, because ^ou do not see they belong to thee, because ^ou
can not believe.

Thus thou see beloved, what a spiritual ^^ndage thou art in with sin and
the Devil, ^^d false Teachers, like the children of Israel (...) Egypt, what
sore bon dage they were in (...) temporal things, so art thou now in
spi^^^uall. And thou know not what to do: ^^^t cry unto the Lord as they
did, and the lord sent them word that they should be ^^ought out of the Land of
Egypt and that ^ondage, to serve him in another Land; so he will do by thee:
thou art in such a spirit^ bondage in this spiritual Egypt, that th^^ can
not serve the Lord here, therefore (...) Lord comes to bring thee out, which he
d^^ by declaring unto thee that this is not (...) way of God: and he would not
have (...) walk in it, nor hear these false Teacher^ny more; for thou art
more and more wo^ded by them. Oh think thou to thy self will go hear them
that they call Independe^^ I see they grow exceedingly in grace, and h^^^
abundance of joy, and walk very com^^^tably with God: and Paul bids us try
all thin^ So I will see whether they can tell me tidi^^ of my Beloved. So when
thou art thus a ^^^ing out of this spiritual Egypt, then con^spirtuall
Pharaoh the Devil with his Army ^^ter thee of reproaches, and scandals, and
^tream displeasure of those that are of near ^^lation to thee, for thy going in
these stran^^ ways, as they say: calling thee Heretiq^^ and threatening thee,
that if thou will not lea^ off these ways, they will never do any th^^ for
thee: but will do thus and thus again thee: then thou art in abundance of
slaw fears, and the red sea of persecution before thee. If the Clergy could
but get power (...) the Magistrate, which they have done the good will to get
it: in the mean timethey wpersecute you in words, and rail on you in heir
pulpits, and call you Heretics, and say ^is pity you should live: you are the
distur^ers of the peace, and if they let you alone, ^ou will be the ruin of
the Kingdom. And ^his they do against thee, because thou will ^ot hear them
any more; for thou art so ^ounded with their Sermons, that thou can ^^ot
hear them any longer; Yet they tell thee ^hou must wait upon them, till the
Lord make ^nown his mind to them: and it is a question whether ever he will
make known his mind ^o them or no, Mat. 23.13. But woe unto you ^cribes and
Pharisees, hypocrites, for ye shut up the Kingdom of heaven against men; for ye
neither go ^^your selves neither suffer ye them that are entering ^o go in.
But they are blind leaders of the blind, and both shall fall into the pits.

Thus thou see what a straight thou art in ^etwixt Pharoah's Army and the
red Sea: and ^hou cryest to the Lord as the children of Isra^^ did: and what
did Moses say which was a ^ype of Christ, Exodus 14.13, 14. Moses said unto the
people; fear ye not, stand still, and see ^e salvation of the Lord, the Lord
shall fight for ^^u, and you shall hold your peace.

First, I shall show you, that yet thou have ^ot seen the salvation of the Lord.

Secondly, Thou must stand still, and thou shall see the salvation of the Lord
for thee.

1. I will not deny, but that thou art (...) child of God; for that good seed
spoken of Mat. 13. is sown in thee, which seed is (...) Word in verse. 19. of
this Chapter, and (...) Word is Christ. John 1. Which seed is Chri^^^ Gal.
3.16. Know ye not that Christ is in you ^^cept you be reprobates: but I trust
you shall kn^^^ you are not reprobates, 2 Cor. 13. 5, 6. For G^^^ has made
known to thee that this seed is thee; for thou find that there is a new
wo^^ wrought in thee; for now thou hate sint^ and have a desire after
goodness: and it is th^^ seed in thee which makes thee so. For wh^^ thou wast
in thy natural condition, th^^ had no such inclination to good, thou^^
sometimes thou art ready to deny this throu^^ the Devils temptation, and thy
own corru^tions.

But yet thou do not know the true way Jesus Christ: The Son of
righteousness not risen in thee to lighten thee in his truth as the truth is
in Jesus. Christ says, I am (...) way, the truth, and the life: no man comes
the Father, but by me, John 14.6. And while the Lord does come and lighten thee
in (...) ways, thou can not find it out: but thou a in the dark: and one
that is in the dark ca^^ not do any thing well, and is ready to stu^^ ^e at
all things, and yet would feign do ^omething.

Thus thou go along in thy own strength (...) perform duties: but all thy
duties and righousnesse is as filthy rags, and that the Devil ^ill tell thee:
and he will overcome thee with is temptations for all thy righteousness. This
not a sufficient armor to stand against him; (...) will wound thee for all
this. For except ^^ur righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the ^ribes
and Pharisees, you shall in no wise enter to the Kingdom of heaven. Which as
yet thou ^^mmest short of that righteousness of the ^ribes and Pharisees, for
they were wonder^^ll strict in their ways; for they looked to be ^stified by
the works of the Law. They did ^^t know any other way, therefore they wal^d in
that way; they were in the dark, and (...) they worked according. So it is with
thee, ^ou look to be justified by the works of the ^^aw; for thou see no
other way, nor have ^en taught any other way, although in words ^^th thou and
they that taught thee are ready (...) deny it.

But do you not say, that except ye do thus ^^d thus, God will not do thus
and thus for ^^ou. What is this, but to be justified by your ^^wne
righteousness: but thou do as the ^^ouse did in Cant. 3.1. By night on my
bed I sought him whom my soul loved, I sought him, b^ I found him not.

What was this night; but the time of h^ dark condition? and what is darkness
but want of light? And in this night on her be^ what was this bed? A bed is to
take their n^ upon, which was her own performances a righteousness. But she
sought him: but she c^^not find him upon her bed; for thy bed is t^ short for
thee to stretch thy self upon, and t^ covering too narrow to wrap thy self
witha^ before the Lord had showed her the light his own self to lead her
where she shou find him. She looked for him upon her b^^ of her own
performances, but it is too sho^^ to reach to heaven, and this covering of h^
righteousness too narrow to cover her sewithal, her filthy nakedness will
appear for that: But that no man is justified by the wo^^^ of the Law in the
fight of God, is evident, G^^ 3.11. Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that
con^^^^ pass your selves about with sparks: walk in light of your fire, and
in the sparks which ye ha^^ kindled. This shall have ye of mine hand, ye sh^^^
lie down in sorrow, Isa. 50.11.

This fire that we kindle, is our righteornesse, these sparks are one and the
same wi^^ the fire. This shall ye have at my hand, ye shall down in sorrow.

The children of God that have, and do walk in this dark condition, going on
in a egall and pharisaicall way, thinking to be jutified by their own
righteousness; for they know no other way; for if they did, they would
willingly embrace it. They lie down ^n abundance of sorrow, they have little
comfort and joy: and when they have, it is quickly gone: and the more they
struggle, the more they are entangled, like a bird in a net, and cannot tell
which way to getout: but thou will say, though my righteousness will not
^ustifie me before God, yet I must perform duties to him because he commands
me; for ^f there be a willing mind, it is accepted, for that a man has, and
not for that he has not. For where much is given, much is required: but where
little is given, there is little required. So, if I do my good will God will
accept it; for that which I cannot do, Christ will do for me.

I answer, That either thou must be justified wholly by thy own
righteousness, or whol^y by Christ's righteousness: for thou must not put them
together: it is forbid to put linen and woollen together? It is Christ that
does all, and he will have all the glory: before the Son of righteousness is
risen to thee through the clear truths of himself, thou can not know it; for
in thy sight we see ligh And while then we make broken Cesterns our selves that
will hold no water, and fo^sake the fountain of living water, as t^^ Scribes
and Pharisees did, which Christ u^braided them for, John 3.19. This is
codemnation, that light is come into the world and men loved darkness rather
than light: in t^^ time of their ignorance, God winked at it: b^ when he came
himself to teach them in t^^ true way, they despised him, and persecut^ him,
and said he was a seducer of the people John 7.12. Thou art a Samaritan, and
have Devil. John 8.48. And he is mad, why be ye him: and said, he was a
blasphemer. And many other reproachful words against him a^^ his Doctrine, and
his Disciples; for whi^^ things they were condemned. So, when the light does
appear to thee, take heed the do not persecute it as they did: and no^ can
by their striving and struggling make the Son to rise, and expel this
darkness, an^ give us the true light, till he please to do himself.

Thus I have showed thee, that yet thou ha^ not seen the salvation of the
Lord? Now shall show you how you shall stand still and (...) the salvation of
the Lord. Thou have tried a^ the ways that thou know, and have labored
exceedingly to find out the ways of God: out cannot find it out. We have
toiled all the ^ight, and taken nothing, Luke 5.5.

Before Christ came in appearance to them, their labor was in vain, they
could find nothing: But when Christ came to them, he bid them let down their
nets into the Sea for a draught. When they had thus done, they enclosed a great
multitude of fishes. And so it has been with thee, thou have toyled all the
night, and have taken nothing. But when Christ manifests himself to thee, to
teach thee what to do, which he will do by his Spirit, in his time; then
thou shall receive multitudes of mercies, and exceeding riches of his love and
goodness, and the joy of it, and a countenance of it in the mean time, Isa.
50.10. Who is among you that fears the Lord, that obeys the voice of his
servant, that walks in darkness, and has no light? let him trust in the
Name of the Lord, and stay upon his God. Isa. 49.23. And thou shall know that I
am the Lord: for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me. Habak. 2.1, 2,
3. I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower: and will watch to
see what the Lord will say unto me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved.
And the Lord answered and said, write the vision, and make it plain upon
Tables, that he may run that reads it. For the vision is yet for an appointe
time: but in the end it shall speak and not lie Though it tarry, wait for it,
because it will sure come, it will not tarry. Isa. 30.18. Blessed an^ all they
that wait for him. Prove. 20.22. Wa^^ on the Lord, and he will save thee. Psalm.
56.3* What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee. And they that do wa^te
upon the Lord, shall fin^ that they have not lost their labor: but he will
abundantly fulfill their desires. The Lord will fight for you, and ye shall hold
your peace for your strength is to sit still, Isa. 30.7.

Thou have labored a great while in vain in thy own strength, and could not
find God now sit still a while, Heb. 10.37. For yet a little while, and he that
shall come, will come, and will not tarry. Thou must not be discontented
because thou have not thy desires granted when thou would, John 7.6. My time
is not yet come: but your time is always ready. Cant. 2.7. I charge you O ye
daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up, nor awake my Love till he
please. The Lords time is the best time. In the mean time, let your
conversation be without covetousness, and be content with such things as you
have. For he has said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee, Heb. 13.5.
It is not only meant in coveting temporal things, but also spiritual: but
thou will be ready to say, if I had such and such things as I want, and I were
thus and thus, as such and such is, then I should be contented: but thou must
be contented with such things as thou have; for the Lord knows what is better
for thee than thou do, 1 Samuel 3.18. It is the Lord: let him do what seems
him good. And, I will not leave thee, nor forsake thee. It is for thy good
whatsoever he does; if it had been most to his glory and thy good, he would
have showed thee his loving kindness at the first, and not have wounded thee
thus: and have led thee by his Spirit in a plain ready way, and have took
away all things that has hindered thee: But when he does show thee his love,
thou will know how to prize it the better; thy happiness consists not in the
actings of Christ, in the which it is but the streams: but in Christ which is
the fountain: and these streams ebb and flow according to the wisdom of
God. And so long as thou do live upon these streams, thy comforts ebb and
flow with the streams: but the Lord did not send these streams of his love to
thee, that thou should live upon them, and build thy comforts upon them: but
he lets these streams of his love sometimes flow forth in thee, to keep thee
from despairing: and at other times with-draws the sense and feeling of it,
that thou should not Idolize them: but look up higher, and see Christ who is
thy full happiness, and he unchange^ble. I am God, I change not: therefore ye
Sonn^ of Jacob are not consumed.

We have thought God to be changeable li^^ our selves; when we performed
duties, he w^^ well pleased with us: and when we fell into f^^ he was angry
with us: and when we ha^^ thought God angry with us, we have kep^ from him,
and durst not go to him, Isa. 5^ 7, 8, 9. Let The wicked forsake his way, and
(...) unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him r^turne unto the Lord, and he
will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pa^don. For my
thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, says the
Lord. F^^ as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are ^^wayes higher than
your ways, and my though^ than your thoughts.

You must forsake your own thoughts (...) God: you have thought him to be
changeab^^ like your self, and his ways like yours: b^^ you must do so no
more. For his though^ are thoughts of peace, and love, and good wi^^ Jer. 31.3.
I have loved thee with an everlasti^ love. His love is unchangeable love; for
wh^ he loves, he loves to the end. Is God unchange^ble? this is exceeding
comfortable to the ch^^dren of God; this will encourage them not (...) be
troubled, though they cannot perform duties always alike; sometimes we
cannot pray, we want words to speak to God. But the Spirit helps our
infirmities; for we know not what we should pray for as we ought. But the
Spirit it selse makes intercessian for us with groans which cannot be
uttered. And he that searches the hearts knows the mind of the Spirit,
because he makes intercession for the Saints according to the will of God,
Romans 8.26, 27. What little cause haft thou to be troubled; though thou carest
not, pray when the Spirit of God prays for thee to the Father, and Christ he
has prayed for thee, John 17. And he makes intercession for thee, 1 John 2.1.
And it is impossible but that the prayers of Christ and the Spirit will be
granted; for the Father will not deny Christ anything. And in Christ thou art
very near and dear to him: and he is very tender and careful over thee, and
will do any thing for thee which is for thy good. He will not keep back
anything from thee which he sees is for his glory and thy good in his time: but
thou must wait his time: and a waiting condition is a happy condition: And it
is he that makes thee to wait. Isa. 40.29, 30, 31. He gives power to the
faint, and to them that have no might, he increases strength. Even the youths
shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall. But they that
wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength: they shall moun^ up with wings
as Eagles; they shall run and no^ be weary, and they shall walk, and not
faint.

Thus I have showed you what it is to stan^^ still.

CHAP. IV.
How Christ makes a way through the Red Sea o^ his own blood which he has
shed for thy sins* for thee to pass out of the spiritual Land of Egypt,
into the spiritual Land of Canaan.

GOd made man in his own Image, Genesis 1 27. He being without sin, and in a
glorious condition, and he knew God: and there was nothing to hinder his
communion with God. He saw God as he was, and he had a clear enjoyment of him;
for he saw God with a spiritual eye, and he was what God would have him to be,
and willing to be at the disposing of God; then was no complaints made o^ him:
and God planted a garden, Genesis 2.8, 9. And out of the ground made the Lord God
to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food: the tree
of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and
evil. The Lord placed Adam there, in the glorious place that was upon the
earth, suitable to his condition; there was all things that his heart could
wish or desire. Verse. 16, 17. And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of
every tree of the Garden thou may freely eat: but of the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil, thou shall not eat of it; for in the day thou
eatest of it, thou shall surely die.

The man and the woman were in a glorious condition, so long as they continued
thus both in spiritual and temporal things. So their happiness was upon
condition; for so long as they forbore eating of the tree of knowledge of good
and evil, they continued in this happiness: but if they eat of it, thou
should surely dye. And the Devil envied man's happy condition: and he enters
into the Serpent, and came to the woman, and said: Yea, has God said, ye shall
not eat of every tree of the Garden? And the Woman said unto the Serpent, we
may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden. But of the fruit of the tree
which is in the midst of the garden God has said, ye shall not eat of it,
neither shall ye touch it lest ye die. And the Serpent said unto the woman, ye
shall not surely die? For God does know, that in the day ye eat thereof, then
your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as Gods, knowing good and evil. And
when the woman saw, that the tree was good for food, and that it was ple^sant
to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to ma^^ one wise, she took of the fruit
thereof, and di^ eat: and gave also to her husband with her, an^ he did eat,
Genesis 3.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

Here the Devil came, and accused God t^ the Woman; has God said ye shall not
eat of every tree of the Garden? For God does know^ that in the day that ye
eat thereof, then your eye shall be opened, and you shall be as Gods, knowin^
good and evil. As if he should say, if God di^ love you, he would not have
barred you from eating of the fruis of that tree: whereby yo^^ should become as
Gods to know good and evil. He had better have barred thee from all the other
things in the garden, then from this? therefore his barring of thee from this
thing which is so good for thee, may make thee question his love to thee in all
other things. An^ though he said, ye shall dye it ye eat of it: ye^ shall not
surely dye. God did not love you^ and therefore he would not have you eat o^
it: and faith, ye shall dye if ye eat of it. But believe me I do tell ye the
truth, and I speak^ in love; you shall not dye: but you shall be as God knowing
good and evil. And who is it tha^ would not be in that condition if they
could* and this is the way to bring them to it: and i^ is an easy way, and
pleasant to eat of the frui^ ^f a tree, that is a small matter, thou needst
^ot fear, that will do thee no harm. Thus ^he Devil first accuses God to
the woman, ^o make way for the tempting of her, that so ^e might the better
prevail with her with his ^emptations: So she listened to him, and be^eved him
what he said, and did eat of the ^^uit: and did give to her husband, and be
eat ^^so.

Thus they believed the Devil in all things, and thought God to be their
Enemy, and ^o be a liar in all things. Thus they forsook God, and made the
Devil their God, in obey^^g him, and in doing this thing, they commit ^^l
manner of sin: and we were in their loins and sinned with them: and of all
sins, God ^ost complains of Idolatry: and here was ^is sin in a high degree
to forsake God, and ^ould not believe him nor obey him: but be^eved the Devil,
and obeyed him who was ^ods enemy: and the eyes of them both were ope^^d; they
knew that they were noked. And verse.

Their eyes were opened to see their misera^^e condition that they had brought
them^^lves into. Before they eat of it, they knew nothing but good: and they
were not conten^d with this, but they would know evil too: ^^d the eating of
this forbidden fruit brought ^^em to know nothing else but evil: so now they
know good and evil. And this aggravated their misery, to know what a good
cond^tion then they were in, and now what a fea^full condition they had brought
themselves in to. And when the Lord came into the garden and called to Adam,
then they ran away an^ hid themselves; after they had sinned, the were afraid
of God, that kept them from the sweet communion of God, which, before they
eat of that fruit, they did enjoy, and h^ was their full happiness: but now
they we^ afraid he should see them: and they did wha^ they could to hide
themselves from him, b^ yet he found them out. And he said unto t^ man, have
thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou should not eat?
And t^ man said, the woman whom thou gave to (...) with me, she gave me of
the tree, and I did ea^ Genesis 3.11, 12.

Here the man does what he can to excu^^ himself, and laid the fault on the
woman, (...) was she that gave it me: and he blames Go^ for giving the woman
to him. It was the wo^ man that thou gave me, it was she that gave (...) me.
If thou had not given me the woman I had not eaten it; for it was through h^
means that I did it, and if thou had not give me her, I had not eaten it.
And the Lord G^^ said unto the woman, what is this that thou h^ done? thou do
not know what a miserable condition thou have brought upon your selves and your
posterity for ever. For by this thing doing, you have lost all your happiness,
both spiritual and temporal: and procured all manner of spiritual and
temporal judgments both here and hereafter. For in the day that thou eatest
thereof, thou shall surely die. And the Woman said, the Serpent beguiled me: he
told me that I should not die: but we should be as God, knowing good and
evil, or else I had not eat it. So she excused her self, and laid the fault
on the Serpent. And the Lord God said unto the Serpent, because thou have done
this, thou art cursed: and I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and
between thy seed and her seed: It shall bruise thy head, and thou shall bruise
his heel, Genesis 3.13, 14, 15.

The Devil has got an interest in all mankind: by their listening to him, and
believing of him, and obeying him, they made him their God. And man, being in
this fearful condition by the Devils getting an interest in him, is led by
him to do what he would have him to do, and there is no remedy to be found
by man: For in the day that thou eatest thereof, thou must dye eternally. For
the wages of sin is death, Romans 6.23. The soul that sins, it shall dye,
Ezekiel. 18.4.

There could be no way found out by man nor any thing in man that could make
satisf^ction for those sins that they had committed but God has found out a
way; he has fou^ out a sufficient ransom, to redeem thee from the wrath of
God, and the cruelty of the D^vill and sin, and heil, which is the Sonne^
God, which was to take flesh upon him, an^ he was to be born of a woman: and he
was (...) make full satisfaction to his Father for all o^ sins. And this is the
feed of the woman the would break the Serpents head. Which seed^ Christ, Gal.
3.16. And God was well pleas^ with mankind, looking upon them in Christ what
he had undertaken for them: and in the fullness of time he was to come and
perform i^ and it was already done in his account. An^ this the Lord made known
to Adam: but h^ had not a clear knowledge of this: but it w^ typified to him
in sacrifices, Genesis 4.4. And (...) made known these things to them in a dar^
way by degrees, as was to his glory and the^ good: and so all along the old
Testament, (...) was typified to them in sacrifices and ordinances, and
ceremonies, still in a dark way, y^^ a more clearer manifestation of him then
before: but all along it speaks of sacrifices: an^ without, there w^^ nothing
to be done; The were to offe^ Peace Offerings, Levit. 3. (...) And if his
Oblation be a sacrifice of Peace Offering, if he offer it of the herd, whether
it be a male or female, he shall offer it without blemish before the Lord: And
he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it at the door of
the Tabernacle of the Congregation: and Aarons sons the Priests shall sprinkle
the blood upon the Altar round about. This was their Peace Offering; it was to
make their peace with God, which sacrifice was a type of Christ; for he was the
true sacrifice that then was to make peace for mankind to his Father: and his
blood was shed to sprinkle our hearts, or wash our hands from dead works to
serve the living God. Therefore was the sacrifices commanded to put them in
remembrance of Christ, which was the substance, and he which they typified: and
for every sin almost there was to be sacrifices, as in Lev. 4. al along the
Chap. there it speaks what must be offered, and how, for sins of ignorance. And
chapter 6. there is a sacrifice to be offered for sins willingly. And c. 16. there
is what is to be offered for the sins of the Priest, and how: and so along that
book it speaks much of sacrifices for the sins of the people. Heb. 9.22. And
almost all things are by the law purged with blood: and without shedding of
blood is no remission. So Christ blood was the Red Sea that they did pass
through to come out of their spiritual bondage which they had brought
themselves in by obeying the Devil. And they saw him darkly through
sacrifices, and ordinances, and ceremonies, which were but shadows of things
to come: but the substance is Christ; and they were not to depend upon their
sacrifices, but upon Christ.

It pleased the Lord to lead them in this dark way, showing himself to them by
degrees, as was most to his glory: yet there was more light showed to them then
was revealed before them in the Prophets. There he shows himself clearly to
them, what he would do for them, and what he was to them, and his exceeding
great love to them: which in the fullness of time he did come and perform it.

Thus they waited a long time, having but a little hope of him, still looking
for his coming in the flesh, and desiring his coming, and yet willing to wait
his time. And at the the last he did come, and finish all things, for the
salvation of their souls, and made full satisfaction to his Father for all
sins, and not for theirs only, but for the sins of the whole world; for all
that was from Adam to the end of the world. Man had sinned, therefore man must
suffer: and it must be one that was without sin; for one that had sin could
not make satisfaction, neither could man as man, but it must be God in man, or
else he could not make satisfaction to God: and it must be man too, or else he
could not suffer: so he must be a middle person betwixt God and man, that must
make satisfaction to God for man. So God sent his only Son out of his bosom
to take our nature upon him: and he was able to make full satisfaction to his
Father for all mankind at once. So the Lord has laid on him the iniquities of
us all, Isa. 53.6.

God has laid our sins upon Christ, and he was willing to take them: so our
sins being laid upon Christ, he is become the debtor; and we are set at
liberty: our sins are all laid upon Christ, so God requires the full debt to be
paid alone by him: He has nothing to say or do against us, because Christ
has undertaken to make full satisfaction to God for us: and he cannot nor will
not require it of Christ and us too, 2 Cor. 5.18, 19, 21. All things are of
God, who has reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ. God was in Christ,
reconcising the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them.
For he has made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made
the righteousness of God in him. Isa. 53.4, 5. Surely he has born our
griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of
God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised
for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him, and with hi^
stripes we are healed; so all along that chapte^ it speaks what Christ suffered
for us. Hos. 13 14. I will ransom them from the power of the grave, I will
redeem them from death. O death I will be thy plagues, O grave I will be thy
destruction: repentance shall be hid from mine eye^ 1 Cor. 15.54, 55, 56, 57.
Death is swallowe^ up in victory? O death! where is thy sting? O grave where is
thy victory? The sting of death is sin, an^ the strength of sin is the Law;
But thanks (...) to God which gives us the victory through o^^ Lord Jesus
Christ. In Hosea he says, I will (...) it: it is he alone that will do it: but
now he^ tell: you it is already done. Death is swallow^ up in victory: and this
is the death that is spoken of in Genesis 2.17. And Christ has gotten victory
over it for us: He is made perfect (...) us through suffering: he was perfect
in himself before, but not for us: but now he (...) perfect for us. I shall
show you how Christ was made perfect for us through suffering: (...) was made
perfect for us 3. ways:

First, By the fulfilling of the whole La^ for us.

Secondly, By making full satisfaction f^^ the sins of the world.

Thirdly, He has purchased of his Fath^^ all things both spiritual and
temporal for us. I shall show you of the two first, and let the other alone
till afterward.

For the first, Christ has fulfilled the whole Law for us. Man was commanded
to do it: and there was a great curse lay upon him if he did not do it.
Cursed is every one that does not all things that are written in the book of
the Law, Gal. 3.10. For whosoever shall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in
one point, he is guilty of all Jam. 2.10. And man, he could not do it: so
Christ he comes and performs the whole law perfectly for us, Mat. 5.17. Think
not that I am come to destroy the Law or the Prophets? I am not come to
destroy, but to fulfill. For verily I say unto you, till heaven and earth
pass, one jot or tittle shall in no wise pass from the Law till all be
fulfilled. And Christ is the end of the Law for righteousness to every one
that believes: and he has fulfilled every jot and tittle of the Law for us;
for he did undertake to fulfill the whole Law for us, to purchase a perfect
righteousness for us by his fulfilling the Law for us. It behooves us says
Christ, to fulfill all righteousness. And which of you can tax me of sin: so
his righteousness is a perfect righteousness, there is not any imperfection
in it, the Lord has not any thing to say against it: and this is for us,
Christ our righteousness, 1 Cor. 1.30. Ye are in Christ Jesus, who of God is
made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption.
Thus Christ has fulfilled the whole Law for us.

Now I shall show you how Christ has made full satisfaction to his Father for
our sins: and that he did by suffering the whole wrath of God for the sins of
the whole world. I have a baptism to be baptized withal, and how am I
straightened till it be accomplished? which was his suffering. He was to drink
off that bitter cup of the whole wrath of God, wrung out by the hand of Gods
vengeance, and to drink the dregs of it for our sins that was laid upon him.
And now you shall see how Christ complains of this wrath of God that lay so
heavy upon him, John 12.27. Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I say?
Father save me from this hour? but for this cause came I unto this hour.
Matthew. 26.38. Then said Jesus unto them, my soul is very heavy, even unto the
death. So he went and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it
be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless, not as I will, but as
thou will, And thus he prayed 3. times. Luke 22.44. And being in an agony, he
prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood
falling down to the ground. How unwilling was the humanity of Christ to suffer
that bitter death and passion that he was to ^ndergoe! for he put up strong
groans and ^ries to him that was above, to save him: and (...) that he prayed
for, he was heard: yet he ^ust suffer, there was no remedy. Yet, says
Christ, nevertheless, not my will, but thy will be ^one. Father, glorify thy
Name, John 12.28. He ^as willing to do or suffer any thing that his ^ather
might be glorified: and his Father ^ould not be glorified, without he did
suffer; ^or it was he alone that could glorify the Father, and he did do it,
by making full satis^action to his Father for all the sins of man^inde, to
redeem them from sin and wrath ^f God, and the condemning power of the ^aw,
and Hell, and damnation. So Christ ^as willing to suffer any thing that his
Father ^id lay upon him, for to glorify his Father, and for the love that he
had to mankind; ^or his love was so great to them, that he was willing to
suffer any thing for their sake, that ^hey might be redeemed from that
miserable condition that they had brought themselves unto: So, although the
humanity of Christ was ^nwilling to suffer that which he was to suffer, ^et the
glory of his Father, and his love to the world so prevailed with him, that he
was willing to suffer: and said, If this cup may not depart except I drink it,
thy will be done. And his prayer was heard of his Father, and (...) request
granted, though he must suffer; f^^ his desire was, that his Father would
glorify (...) Name, John 12.28. Then came a voice from he^ven, saying, I have
both glorified it, and (...) glorify it again. Here was his request grant^^
him: and he enabled him to bear that whi^^ he laid upon him, Luke 22.43. And
there (...) peared an Angel from heaven unto him, streng^^ning him.

Christ did not suffer as he was God, but (...) he was man; for the Godhead
could not s^^fer: And as he was man, he was weak, a^^ had need to be
strengthened, comforted, a^^ up-held: and it was his Divinity that up-he^^ his
humanity. So he being thus strengthen^^ he was put upon the suffering: so he
was b^traid to be put to death by his Disciple, (...) that was near to him,
and pretended mu^^ love to Christ. He was taught by Christ (...) ways of God,
and he taught others, yet (...) betrayed Christ, for him to be put to death he
betrayed him into the hands of wic^^ men: and ye shall see how they mis-used
h^^ And the men that held Jesus, mocked him, (...) smote him: And when they had
blind-folded h^^ they struck him on the face: and asked him, say^^^ who was it
that smote thee? And many ot^^^ things blasphemously spoke they against hi^
^uke 22.63, 64, 65. And Herod with his men ^f War set him at naught, and
mocked him, and ^raied him in a gorgeous robe, Luke 23.11. Then ^ilate
therefore took Jesus and scourged him, and ^he Soldiers platted a crown of
thorns, and put it ^n his head: and they put on him a purple robe, and said,
hail, King of the Jews. They smote him with their hands, John 19.1, 2, 3.
Matthew. 27.^6.

Thus they mocked him, and despitefully used him which came to save them: and
it was because he said he was the Son of God, and was their King, to reign
spiritually over them; therefore in contempt they put a crown of thorns upon
his head. They did look for Christ to come to redeem them, and to reign over
them: but they did not look for him to come in that manner to them as he did
come, in the shape of a servant, but in great pomp, like an earthly King, and
so to reign over them temporally. So when Christ did come, because he did not
come according as they expected him to come, they hated him and despised him,
and said, we will not have this man to reign over us: he has no form nor
comeliness: and when ye shall see him, there is no beauty that we should
desire him. He is despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows, and
acquainted with griefs, and we hid as it were our from him. He was despised,
and we esteem^ him not, Isa. 53.3.

His comeliness and beauty did not consi^^ in temporal things; If it had,
then they wou^^ have loved him: but Christ said, his Kingdom was not of this
world. The foxes have holes, a^^ the birds have nests: but the Son of man has
n^^ wherewithal to lay his head. But his Kingdom is a spiritual Kingdom, and
they did no^ know this Kingdom which he was King ove^ but they looked with the
eye of flesh, and tha^ could not see Christ's Kingdom: so with (...) fleshly
eye they looked for a fleshly King t^ reign over them in a fleshly way. And
whe^^ he was come, they saw him so mean in outward things over they expected:
then the^ said, this is not he, John 7.27. We know th^^ man whence he is. But
when Christ comes no man knows whence he is. Is not this the Carpenters
son? Is not this Jesus the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know,
John 6.42. They slighted him, because they did not see him in that outward
pomp as they expected: so they hated him, and persecuted him, and spit on him,
and took the reed and smote him, Mat. 27.30. And when the chief Priests
therefore and Officers saw him, they cried out, saying, crucify him, crucify
him. Pilate said unto them, take ye him and crucify him, for I find no fault
in him, John 19.6. They confessed there was no fault in him, yet they would put
him to death: but all this was done upon Christ for our sins, they being laid
upon him: and ^hey were the instruments that God had appointed to bring Christ
to the Cross. It is ne^essary that offenses come: but woe be to them by whom
they do come.

And till the time was come that was appointed of the Father, they could do
nothing to him: and when the time did come, that he should suffer, they brought
him to the Cross, and nailed him to it: but Christ laid down his life freely
of himself, John 10.17, 18. Therefore does my Father love me, because I ^ay
down my life, that I might take it up again. No man takes it from me, but I
lay it down of my self; I have power to lay it down, and I have ^ower to
take it up again: this Commandment have I received of my Father.

So now, the time of his suffering being come, he was willing to lay down his
life for poor miserable fallen mankind, he being nailed upon the Cross: he
endured sore pains in his body, and much more in his mind; for the whole
wrath of God lay upon him for all our sins; for he was wounded for our
transgressions both spiritual and temporal. A man may bear the infirmities of
his body: but a wounded spirit who can bear. They that h^^^ been wounded in
spirit, can tell that it i^ (...) very sore thing, and heavy to be borne. H^^
much more sorer and heavier was it upon Christ, when he was wounded for all the
f^^ of all mankind? it made him to cry out: (...) God, my God, why have thou
forsaken me, Mar. 1^ 34. Is it nothing to you all ye that pass by? (...) hold
and see, if there be any sorrow like my sorr^^ which is done unto me, wherewith
the Lord h^^ afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger, Lam. (...) 12. There
was never affliction like this th^^ was done unto Christ: his love was so gr^^
to mankind, that there was not any thing t^^ dear to him, but he was willing
to for-go^ (...) for their sakes: he shed his heart-blood f^^ their sakes;
our sins could not be pardone^^ without his blood being shed; for without
bloodshedding there is no remission, Heb. (...) 12. And it is not possible
that the blood ^^buls and goats should take away sins: whe^^fore when he
comes into the world, h^ says: Sacrifice and offering thou would not but a
body have thou prepared me. In burnt off^rings and sacrifices for sin thou have
had no ple^sure. Then said I, lo I come to do thy will, (...) God. By the
which will we are sanctif^^^ through the offering of the body of Christ Jes^^
once for all, Heb. 10.4, 5, 6, 7. It was not t^^ sacrifice of beasts that could
take away sin, or make satisfaction to God: therefore he prepa^ed Christ, a
body, and he was the only sa^rifice that could and did make full satisfacti^n
to God for the sins of the whole world, 1 ^et. 2.24. Who his own self bare
our sins in ^is own body on the tree: that we being dead to ^^nne, should
live unto righteousness, by whose ^^ipe^ ye were healed. Titus 2.14. Who gave
him^^lfe for us, that he might redeem us from all ini^^ity, and purify unto
himself a peculiar people, ^^^alous of good works, Col. 1.14. In whom we
^ave redemption through his blood, even the for^^venesse of sins, Gal. 3.13.
Christ has redeemed ^^s from the curse of the Law, being made a curse ^or us.
For it is written, cursed is every one that ^angeth on a tree. So Christ was
made perfect ^or us through suffering, John 19.28. After ^^is, Jesus knowing
that all things were now ac^omplished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled.
and verse. 30. He said, it is finished: and he how^^ his head, and gave up the
ghost.

I have now showed you that the Father has ^^id all our sins upon Christ,
and he has ^ade full satisfaction to the Father for them. All our sins being
laid upon Christ, they are ^ecome his, they are not ours, but his. For ^e has
made him to be sin for us that knew no sin, that we might be made the
righteousness of God in him, 2 Cor. 5.21. And Christ redeemed us fr^^ the
curse of the law, being made a curse for (...) How was Christ made sin and a
curse for (...) If a man be bound to pay another man's de^^^^ he is become the
debtor: and if the Credito^^ follows the Law of him, he must pay the deb^^^^
and he paying the debt, the other that ow^ the debt is freed, there is nothing
to be do^^^ against him, because the other has satisfi^^ the Creditour.

So our sins being laid upon Christ, an^ he undertaking to pay a full
satisfaction to (...) Father for them, he is become the debtor, o^ sins are
his, and his Father looks upon h^^ as the sinner: not that himself had sinned,
(...) bearing our sins: and as he became the si^ner for us, so he became a
curse for us. F^^ the Law says, Cursed is every one that contin^eth not in all
things which are written in the b^^^ of the Law to do them, Gal. 3.10.

So God has required this debt of Christ (...) be paid by him to the utmost
farthing: and (...) has done it for us; there is nothing to b^ done for the
salvation of our souls, but all (...) done already for us by the sufferings of
Christ and God is fully satisfied and well pleas^^ This is my beloved Son, in
whom I am well ple^sed, Mat. 3.17. And he is as well pleased wi^^ us in his
Son, as he is with his Son; a^^ he has no more to say against us for our
sins than he has against his Son. And God does love us with the same love
that he has loved Christ withal, John 17.23.

CHAP. V. Now Christ is offered freely to all mankind without any price or
worthiness of their own.
GOd was pleased to make Christ a sacrifice for the sins of the whole world, to
reconcile ^he world unto himself, not imputing their sins ^^to them, 2 Cor.
5.19. And God would have ^^e world to know what Christ has done for ^^em: he
would not have his love and mercy, and great goodness to be hid from them, but
(...) be made known to them, that poor souls ^^at are wounded with sin, may
look upon christ that was crucified for their sins: and (...) him see God as
well pleased with them, as (...) is with Christ. There is nothing now to under
Gods love to us, he loves us freely. I ^ll heal their rebellions, I will love
them freely, (...) my anger is turned away from them, Hos. 14. (...). Behold
the days come (says the Lord) that I ^ll make a new covenant with the house
of Israel, (...) with the house of Judah. Not according to the Covenant that I
made with their fathers, where I took them by the hand to bring them out of
the land of Egypt: the which my Covenant they brake although I was an Husband
unto them, says the Lord. But this shall be the Covenant that I wi^^ make with
the house of Israel: After those day^ (says the Lord) I will put my Law in
their i^ ward parts, and write it in their hearts, and will be their God, and
they shall be my people. F^^ I will forgive their iniquity, and will rememb^^
their sins no more, Jer. 31.31, 32, 33, 34.

That old covenant that he made with the^ was a covenant of works: and that
covenan^ they broke, they were not able to keep it: b^ now God has made a new
covenant with (...) in Christ, a better covenant than the other for God has
given Christ to us for a co^nant, for him to undertake to make full
satisfaction for our sins, and to be a Medi^tor betwixt God and us.

There was nothing in us that moved Go^^ to bestow his Son upon us to be
crucisied f^^ us: but it was his free love. Herein is love, (...) that we loved
God, but that he loved us, and se^^ his Son to be the propitiatin for our sins,
1 Joh^ 4.10. Hereby perceive we the love of God, beca^^ he laid down his life
for us, 1 John 3.16. A^^^ while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us, e^
when we were dead in sins, Ephesians. 2.5. For so loved the world, that he gave
his only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in him should not perish, but
have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the
world, but that the world through him might be saved, John 3.16, 17. For I came
not to judge the world, but to save the world, John 12.47. Greater love has no
man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friend, John 15.13.

That is the greatest love that friends can show one to another: but Christ
has loved us with a greater love; for while we were his enemies, he dyed for
us to reconcile us to God, and to make us his friend; he takes occasion by our
sins to show us merry. The Lord complains of the spiritual Idolatry of his
people, in Hosea 2. which of all sins, that is partly the greatest, to forsake
God, and cleave to Idols, and to give that to them that belongs only to God;
for they made their Idols their God, and gave honor and glory to them: but the
Lord says; I will not give my honor to another, nor my glory to graven
Images, Hos. 2.13, 14. She decked her self with her earrings and her jewels,
and she followed her Lovers, and forgate me, says the Lord. Therefore behold,
I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, aad speak comfortably
to her, Hos. 11.7. My people are bent to rebellion against me: though they
called them to the most High, yet none at all would exalt him. Yet this did not
turn the love of the Lord from them; for in the 8. and 9. verses, he says,
How shall I give thee up Ephraim, how shall I delive thee, Israel? how shall I
make thee as Admah! how shall I set thee as Zeboim? Mine heart is turned within
me, my repentings are rouled together I will not execute the fierceness of my
wrath, I will not return to destroy Ephraim; for I am God and not man, the holy
One in the midst of thee, Ezekiel. 20.44. And ye shall know that I am the Lord,
when I have respect unto you for my Names sake and not after your wicked ways,
nor according to your corrupt works, O ye house of Israel, says th^^ Lord,
Isa. 43.25. I, even I am he that puts away thine iniquities for mine own
sake, and will not remember thy sins, Isa. 44.22. I have put away thy
transgressions like a cloud, and thy sinner as a mist: turn unto me, for I have
redeemed thee, Jer. 33.8. And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity,
whereby they have sinned against me: and I will pardon all their iniquities
whereby they have sinned against me, and whereby they have transgressed against
me, Jer. 50.20. And in those days, and at that time, says the Lord, the
iniquitie^ of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none, and for the
sins of Judah, and they shall not be found; for I will be merciful unto them.

Here is the free mercy of God, and riches of his love belonging to all
mankind, that ever was, is, or shall be; there is not any one excluded from
his love; for there is nothing can keep us from God but our sins, and that
Christ has dyed for, and has made full satisfaction to his Father, and has
obtained of his Father a full pardon for all the sin of all mankind,
although they be never so great, 1 Timothy 1.15. This is a faithful saying, and
worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save
sinners, of whom I am chief. He was a persecuter, and a blasphemer, and an
injurious person; ye (says he) I obtained mercy. The Lord is no respecter of
persons.

He shed his dearest heart-blood for all sinners, as well for the chief of
sinners as any other; for without bloodshedding there can be no remission of
any one sin, though never so small in our apprehension: but by the blood of
Christ being shed for us, the greatest sins are pardoned as well as any. For
the blood of Christ cleanses us from all unrighteousness. And this gift of
God in giving his Son, is a free gift of God, given to all, to redeem all
from sin, hell, and the Devil, Hes. 13.9. O Israel one has destroyed thee,
but in me is thy help. The Devil having overcome man by his tempting the
woman, and they yielding to him, we were all destroyed by the Devil: but in
Christ is our help against him, Jer. 31.11. The Lord has redeemed Jacob, and
ransomed him from the hand of him that was stronger than he.

All mankind fell, by and in the fall of Adam, from that glorious condition
that th^^ were in before they sinned: So we all fell from that glorious
condition with him, into a sta^^ of condemnation, sin, and the wrath of Go^
both spiritual and temporal, and hell an^ damnation: and as we all fell in
Adam, so we are all raised by, and in Christ, not to tha^ condition that Adam
fell from, but from tha^ condition that he fell into: and as we all dye^ in
Adam, so we are all made alive in Christ Adam was a public person for
mankind so was Christ; therefore he is called the secon^ Adam. Therefore as by
the offenses of one, which was Adam, judgment came upon all men to c^^
demnation; even so by the righteousness of ou^ which is Christ, the free gift
came upon all m^^ unto justification of life. For as by one man's dis^^ bedience
many were made sinners: so by the obe^^ence of one shall many be made
righteous, Romans ^^ 18, 19.

All were made sinnners in Adam, so all a^^ made righteous by Christ.

Quest. How are all made righteous (...) Christ?

Answ. He being made a public person so all mankind: he undertook to make
full satisfaction for our sins, which he did commit: so he redeemed us from that
condemnation that came upon all the world by the fall of Adam: so that for
those sins we shall never be condemned.

He has redeemed the whole world from the Devil and sin, to himself, that
we should serve him in all love: so the Devil and sin cannot keep the world
out of heaven, they can do us no harm; yea, those that are very great sins
cannot: nothing but unbelief can keep us out. There was nothing that kept the
children of Israel out of the Land of Canaan but unbelief. We see they could
not enter in because of unbelief, Heb. 3.19. They had committed many sins, and
those that were very great ones: and God complained of their sins in many
places of Scripture, yet none of them kept them out of the Land of Canaan,
which was a type of heaven, but only unbelief. And this is the condemnation,
that light is come into the world: and men loved darkness rather then light,
John 3.19.

Christ has obtained of his Father a full pardon for all the sins of the
world, and a perfect righteousness, and heaven, and spiritual and temporal
things, and it is kept in store for us in Christ; all the spiritual things are
till we do really believe what Jesus Christ has done for us in particular,
and he would have his love made known to the world tha^ they might believe:
and then he will mak^ known to them that their sins are pardoned and how great
his love is to them, and wh^^ he has purchased for them, and what the^ are in
him. And although there remains s^^ in the conversation, yet sin in the
conscien^^ is done away. The blood of Christ, which through the eternal
spirit, offered himself without spo^^ purge your consciences from dead works,
to ser^^ the living God, Heb. 9.14. And he speaking i^ the 9th verse of this
chapter, and verse 2. of the 10th chapter of the sacrifices in the time of the
Law, there was offered gifts and sacrifices tha^ could not make holy,
concerning the conscience of him that did the service; for if it could would
they not then have ceased to have bee^ offered, because that that the offerers
onc^ purged, should have had no more sine in their conscience: but those
sacrifices could not take away sin in the conscience, Heb. 9.24, 25, 26. For
Christ is not entered into the holy places, ma^^ with hands, which are the
figures of the true; bu^ into heaven itself, now to appear in the prese^^ of
God for us. Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high Priest
enters into the holy pl^^^ every year with blood of others. For then must
often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end
of the world has be appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. And
it is he alone that can and will sanctify us in our conversation; Let us draw
near with a true heart in assurance of faith, sprinkled in our hearts from an
evil conscience, and washed in our bodies with pure water, Heb. 10.22. Christ
shed both water and blood, John 19.^4. His blood for to sprinkle our conscience
from evil works, that so they shall not damn us, and water to purge and
sanctify us in our conversation, that sin shall be mortified in us, and we
shall walk in obedience to God. And this Christ has done for all, and would
have all know it, that they all might come to Christ and be saved. For be
tasted death for-every man, Heb. 2.9. And be dyed for all, that they that live
should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him that dyed for them,
and rose again, 2 Gor. 5.15.

Christ not only dyed and was buried, but he also rose from the dead; which
does declare unto us, that he has gotten the victory over the spiritual
death for us; he triumphed over it for us. Death is swallowed up in victory? O
death! where is thy sting? O grave! where is thy victory? The sting of death is
sin, and the strength of sin is the law; But thanks be to God which gives us
the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ 2 Cor. 15.54, 55, 56, 57.

So Christ has done all things for thee, an^ has made way for to go to God
by him. Jesus said, I am the way, the truth and the life, ^man comes to the
Father, but by me, John 1^ 6. And now he makes a general proclamat^on for all
to come unto him, and he will gi^^ them life; for their life is hid in him: and
they do not come unto him, they shall dye^ their sins: and the Lord says; As
I live, I wi^^ not the death of a sinner. Isa. 55.1, 2, 3. Ho, ev^^^ one that
thirsts, come ye to the waters, and (...) that has no money: come ye, buy
and eat, yea com^ buy wine, and milk without money, and with^^^ price.
Wherefore do ye spend money for that whi^^ is not bread? and your labor for
that which sati^fieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and ea^^ ye that which
is good, and let your soul delight self in fatness. Incline your ear and
come un^me hear, and your soul shall live, and I wi^^ make aneverlasting
Covenant with you, even t^^ sure mercies of David.

The waters that we are invited to come (...) to, is Christ; he is the water of
life, John 4.1^ And he calls all to come, without any worth nesse of their
own; though they are never (...) great sinners, let them come, let them not
ke^^ back because they are great sinners: but therefore let them come; for he
dyed for their sins: and if they come unto him, he will give them a ^ardon for
their sins, their sins cannot be too great for him to pardon: and do not
stay for ^ualification to come to Christ, for there is ^o qualification out of
Christ: but come unto him, and he will qualify thee; there is no vessel so
unclean, but the blood of Christ will cleanse ^t. And says Christ, Those that
come to me, I will ^^n no wise cast away: and that wine and milk is Christ,
John 15.1. I am the Vine that brought forth those grapes that this wine came
of, and he was pressed in the wine-pres of the wrath of God, for us to drink
of the fruit of it. And as it is the nature of wine to comfort, strengthen, and
refresh those that are ready to faint. So it is with this spiritual wine,
Christ; whosoever has tasted of him, it comforts him exceedingly: and when
they are ready to faint through the sense of their sins, this wine refreshes
them, and strengthens them against the Devils temptations and their own sins:
and this milk is to feed those that are babes in Christ. I have fed you with
milk, and not with meat, for bitherto ye were not able to bear it, 1 Cor.
3.2. For every one that uses milk is unskilful in the word of
righteousness; for he is a babe, Heb. 5.13. So Christ is this milk that feeds
those that are babes in him; he is their nourishment, and he reveals his
love to them by degrees: and (...) are babes at the first, and grow by degrees
be men in Christ, and he leads them acco^ding. Wherefore do ye spend money
for that whi^^ is not bread? you spend a great deal of cost pains to get a
righteousness of your own, a^^ so feed upon that: but that is not bread, th^^
is but ashes, that will not nourish thee, b^^ wildo thee more harm than good.
Christ sait^ He is the bread of life, John 6.48. This is (...) bread which came
down from heaven, that a m^^ may eat of it and not dye. I am the living bre^^
which came down from heaven; if any man eat this bread be shall live for
ever: and the bread the I will give is my flesh, which I will give for t^^ life
of the world, verse. 50, 51. And this brea^ he gives to all freely. And this
is that tha^ will feed and nourish your souls; therefore feed upon this, and
do not spend your labor in vain, thinking to get a righteousne^^ of your
own, which is not the righteousnes^ of Jesus Christ, that thou might feed
upon that, and be satisfied with it: but that cannot satisfy thee, if thou
go to feed upon it, (...) will choke thee: but hearken diligently to me,
and eat that which is good, and let your soul delight it self in his
fatness. What he has done for thee, and what he has obtained for thee and
come unto me; hear, and your soul shall live. So hear, that ye really believe
what Christ has done for you, and your soul shall live. And I will make an
everlasting Covenant with you, ^ven the sure mercies of David. For this is the
Covenant that I will make with them, After those days (says the Lord) I will
put my laws into their hearts, and I will be to them a God, and ^hey shall be
to me a people. And they shall not ^each every man his brother, saying, know
the Lord; for all shall know me from the least to the greatest. For I will be
merciful to their unrighteousness: and their sins and iniquities will I
remember no more, Heb. 8.10, 11, 12.

And it is a sure Covenant; for it was established upon better promises than
the old Covenant was, and God is unchangeable. I am God, I change not,
therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed. And the Spirit and the Bride
says ^ome: and let him that hears, say come: and set him that is athirst,
come: and whosoever will, let him take the water of life, freely, Rev. 22.17.
Wisdom has builded her house, she has killed ^er beasts, she has mingled
her wine, she has also furnished her table. She has sent forth her Maidens,
she cries upon the highest places of the City: Whose is simple, let him turn
in hither: as for him that wants understanding, she says to him: Come eat
of my bread; and drink of the wine that I have mingled, Prove. 9.1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

This wisdom is Christ, and it was he the was killed for the sins of the
world. This the fatted Calfe that was killed, Luke 15.2^ And the Lamb slain
from the beginning of t^^ world. Matthew. 22. Behold, I have prepared (...)
dinner, my oxen and fatlings are killed, and (...) things are ready, come unto
the marriage.

It is Christ alone that has prepared (...) things for this spiritual
marriage betwi^^ himself and his people. There is nothing (...) be done, but
all things are already prepar^ for this spiritual feast; there is nothing f^^
us to do, but to come and eat and drink freely of those things that are
prepared for us And he sends forth his servants for to cry (...) the highest
places of the City: and to cry (...) loud: Spare not, lift up their voice
like a Tru^^ pet, Isa. 58.1. That all may hear and come that those that are
simple may learn true wi^dome of him.

CHAP. VI. How we should come to Christ, and have the things that he has
prepared for all.
THere is no other way to come to Chri^^^ but by believing what he has done
for them in particular, and to apply it to themselves. These things are
written, that ye might be^ieve that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God: and
that in believing, ye might have life through his ^ame, John 20.31. He that
believes in the Son ^f God has the witness in himself: he that belie^eth
not God, has made him a liar, because he ^elieved not the record that God
witnessed of his ^on. And this is the record, that God has given unto us
eternal life: and this life is in his Son. He that has the Son, has life:
and he that has ^ot the Son, has not life. These things have I written unto
you that believe in the name of the Son of God, that ye may know that ye have
eternal life, and that ye may believe in the name of the Son ^f God, 1 John
5.10, 11, 12, 13. For God so lo^ed the world, that he gave his only begotten
Son, that whosoever believes in him, should not perish, ^ut have everlasting
life, John 3.16. And this is ^ife eternal, that they know thee the only true
God, and Jesus Christ whom thou have sent, John ^7.3. Let not your hearts be
troubled, ye believe ^n God, believe also in me, John 14.1. For I am ^ome a
light into the world; whosoever believes in ^^e shall not abide in darkness,
Joh. 12.40. And ^his is the work of God, that ye believe in him whom he has
sent, John 6.29. He that belie^eth in me (as says the Scripture) out of his
belly shall flow rivers of water of life, John 7.38. He that believes in me,
has everlasting life, Joh^ 6.47. And Jesus said unto them, I am the bre^ of
life; he that comes to me shall not hunger, (...) he that believes in me
shall never thirst. A^^ this is the will of him that sent me, that every (...)
which sees the Son, and believes in him, sho^^ have everlasting life, and I
will raise him up the last day, John 6.35.40.

He that does believe Christ, does kno^ Christ, and does know the Father also;
(...) Christ and his Father are one: and he do^^ know that Christ has
pardoned his sins, having made full satisfaction for them to his Father: and
that God is as well pleased with hi^ in his Son, as he is with his Son: and
do^ not only believe this, because it is in the Scripture, but because the
Spirit of God witnesse^ it to them by the enjoyment of it, though sometimes
they have not the comfort of (...) Believing and faith is all one: and we are
just^fied by faith, and not by works, and therefore we conclude, that a man is
justified by faith without the works of the Law, Romans 3.2^ By the works of ehe
law shall no flesh be justified (...) his fight.

For by the Law comes the knowledge of sin, (...) now is the righteousness of
God made manife^^ without the Law, bearing witness of the Law an^ the
Prophets, to wit, the righteousness of God (...) the faith of Jesus Christ
unto all and upon all that believe: for there is no difference, for all have
sinned and are deprived of the glory of God, and are justified freely by his
grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God has set forth
to be a reconciliation through faith in his blood, to declate his
righteousness by the forgiveness of the sins that are passed through the
patience of God, Romans 3.20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25. If Abraham were justified by
works, he has wherein to rejoice, but not with God; but what says the
Scripture, Abraham believed God and it was counted to him for righteousness:
For the promise that he should be the heir of the world, was not given to
Abraham or to his seed, through the Law, or his righteousness that he had
obtained by the works of the Law, but through the righteousness of faith: for
if they that are of the Law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise is
made of no effect: for the law causes wrath, because we cannot keep it, for
where no Law is, there is no transgression, it is the Law that discovers sin
unto us, Romans 7.7. therefore it is by faith, that it might come by grace,
Romans 3.23, 13, 14, 15.16. For by faith the righteousness of God is revealed from
faith to faith, as it is written, The just shall live by faith, Romans 1.17. Know
that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus
Christ, even we, I say, have believed in Jesus Christ, that woe might be
justified by the faith of Christ, and no^ by ^he works of the Law, because that
by the work^ of the Law no flesh shall be justify, Galat. 2.16. If there had
been a law given which could have given life, surely righteousness should have
been b^ the Law, but the Scripture has concluded all under sin, that the
promise by the faith of Jesus Christ should be given to them that believe; but
before faith came, we were kept under the Law, an^ shut up unto the faith which
should afterward (...) revealed: wherefore the Law was our Schoolmast^^ to
bring us to Christ, that we might be made rig^teous by faith, but that after
faith is come, we (...) no longer under a Schoolmaster, Galat. 3.21, 22, 23,
24, 25. Now the Law is not our School master to bring us to Christ, for
Christ^come, and the Ministers ought to preach t^ a^l people what Christ has
done for then that they might believe, and how can they belee^^ in him of whom
they have not heard? Romans 1^ 14. They must first hear what he has do^^ for
them before they can believe; and Christ has commanded his Apostles and
Discipl^^ to preach the Gospel to all, Matthew. 28.1^ and what is the Gospel but
glad tidings (...) peace and good things? Romans 10.15. How beautiful upon the
mountains are the feet him that declares and publishes peace, the declares
good tidings, and publishes sal^tion, saying to Sion, Thy God reigns, Isai.
5^ They are to publish and make known to all ^orts of people what Christ has
done for them, how he has made peace with God for them, in taking upon him all
their sins, and making full satisfaction for them, and has wrought a perfect
salvation for them, and (...) perfect righteousness for them, and all things ^s
already finished for them, John 19.30. and ^ll things are ready, come to the
marriage, Matthew. 22.4. that Christ has made all things ready for us, there is
nothing to be ^one by us for our salvation, but for us to ^ome to him, and he
will give us all things ^reely, and he will teach us all things, and ^ead us in
the way that we should walk in, for (...) am the Way (says Christ) the Truth
and the Life, no man comes to the Father but by me, John ^46. As soon as
Christ was born there was an Angel came and declared to the Shepherds in ^he
field, and said to them, Be not afraid, for ^^bold, I bring you glad tidings of
great joy that shall be to all people, that is, that unto you is born (...)
Savior, which is Christ the Lord, Luke 2.10, ^1. God sent his Angel to
declare this to the ^hepheards, that they should declare it to others. And this
shows unto us, that those that God has made known his love unto, by their
enjoyment of it, they must make it ^nown to others, that they also may be
partakers of it, and the Angel fell a praising God, aying, Glory be to God in
the high heavens, an^ peace in earth, and good will toward men, at the 14.
verse.

Christ being born into the world, was ^^ceeding to Gods glory, and by his
comi^^ he has made it known to us that he is glorified, and he has made our
peace with God and has made known to us that he is at pea^ with us, and what
love and good will God had to us in Christ; and the Angel could do n^ other
but declare this, that all might kno^ this and believe. And this is the Gospel
the Christ has commanded should be preache^ and his Apostles did preach it,
and Paul says there is a constraint laid on me, and woe be to (...) if I
preach not the Gospel. I am not ashamed^ the Gospel of Jesus Christ, for it is
the power (...) God to salvation to every one that believes. T^^ comes with
power, and overcomes the chiefe^ sinners, as it did Paul, to hear of the love
(...) God to them, and what Christ has done a^^ suffered for them, and has
obtained a pardon of his Father for them, and calls every one t^ come to him
and receive their pardon of hi^ This will work more upon them, then (...)
preach the law and judgments to them, a^ tell them that God is angry with
them: the drives them from Christ, and the messenge^ of Christ must do the
message of Christ, and not any thing to drive them from Christ, but to set them
on believing in Christ.

So now ye may see, that the Law is not now our Schoolmaster to bring us to
Christ, now Christ is come the law must not be preached to us, except it be to
tell us how Christ has fulfilled it for us; but to tell us that we must do
thus and thus, or else God will not do thus and thus for us? what is this but
to be justified by the works of the law, and in so doing they make God a liar,
and take the honor from God, and give it to themselves: for we are wholly
justified by faith alone, and not by works; and it is not our faith that
justifies us, but it is the faith of Jesus Christ. Know that a man is not
justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we
have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of
Christ, Galat. 2.16. and the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the
faith of the Son of God, Gal. 2.20. By grace are ^e saved through faith, and
that not of your selves, it is the gift of Gad, not of works, lest any man
should boast, Ephesians. 2.8, 9. It is not our faith that can justify us; if it
could, then should we boast* that we are justified by our faith, and ^o make
our works the cause of our justification: but here Paul tells us, that by grace
we are saved, that is, by the grace of Christ, for (...) has justified us
freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ: so it
(...) alone by Christ that we are redeemed, saw and justified, and we come to
believe this (...) the faith of Christ: this faith is the eye to (...) what
Christ has done for us, so through the faith we are justified by Christ, and
this is the free gift of God, and is not any thing of o^^ selves, our faith is
imperfect, and therefore (...) cannot justify us, I believe, Lord help my
un^^liefe. So that our faith cannot justify us, because there is unbelief in
it, Lord help my (...) belief; but the faith of Christ is perfect, a^ that
alone does justify every one that hath^ and without this faith it is
impossible to ple^^ God, Heb. 11.6. and every thing which is (...) of this
faith, is sin, and Christ is the autho^^ and finisher of this faith, Heb.
12.2. And all* long the 11. chapter of the Hebrews, the speaks what great
things were done by t^^ faith, and the Lord calls and invites all men come to
him, and eat freely of this spirito^ feast that he has prepared for them; he
(...) vites them by the outward preaching of (...) word, and inward movings of
his Spirit, P^^ 1.20, 21, 22, 23. Wisdom cries without, utters her voice in
the streets, she cries the chief place of concourse, in the openi^ of the
gates in the city, she utters her words, saying, How long ye simple ones
will ye love simplicity, and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools
hate knowledge? turn you at my reproof, behold I will pour our my Spirit
unto you: I will make known my words unto you. Here is the outward call: and in
Genesis 6.3. there is the inward, And the Lord said, My Spirit shall not always
strive with man. So it does appear that his Spirit does strive with man to
bring him to himself, John 12.32. And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will
draw all men unto me. Hosea 11.4. I drew them with cords of a man, with bands
of love, and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I
laid meat unto them. Thus christ draws all both inward and outward, with the
bonds of love, that he might take off that heavy yoke off their sins off
them, and see them laid upon Christ, and see this spiritual meat which is laid
before them, and they to feed on it, and do appeal to every ones conscience
whether they do not find at one time or other, an inward moving by the Spirit
of God, for to go unto God, and the Lord will receive them; and they have some
glimpse of the love of God to them to invite them to go: and there is nothing
can move us to go to God but the Spirit of God: therefore it is the Spirit of
God that does draw all

CHAP. VII. None can truly repent till they go unto God, an^ when they do go
he will give them a true repentance.
THere is not any that can truly repent (...) their sins, till they do see
in some measure the love of God to them: they may repent because their sins
provoke Gods ange^ against them, and for fear of hell, and the judgments of
God, and because they keep them out of heaven; but this is not a true
repentance, a true repentance is such a repentance that they need not repent
them of; bu^ there requires a repentance to repent of this repentance: but it
is the love of God made known to them, that makes them to be humbled for their
sins, because they offend so loving a God, and they were the cause that
Christ was crucified, and therefore they hate their sins, because they are an
enemy to God, and keeps them from the communion of God. O the love of God to
thee constrains thee to love him again, and thou art ashamed of thy sins,
and hate them because God hates them; so it is the love of God to them that
causes true repentance. When Christ looked upon Peter, then he went out and
wept bitterly, Luke 22.61, 62. Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more
with Idols? Hos. 14.9. Ephraim was a great sinner, he worshipped Idols, yet when
he saw the love of God to him, it so overcame him, that he cries out, Whot have
I to do any more with Idols? though I have had to do with them, yet now I
hate them, because God hates them. Ierem. 31.18, 19. I have heard Ephraim
lamenting thus, Thou have corrected me, and I was chastised as an untamed Colt;
convert thou me and I shall be converted* for thou art the Lord my God. Surely
after that I converted, I repented, and after that I was instructed, I smote
upon my thigh, I was ashamed, yea confounded, because I did bear the reproach
of my youth, Ezekiel. 16.62, 63. And I will establish my covenant with thee, and
thou shall know that I am the Lord, that thou may remember and be ashamed,
and never open thy mouth any mouth any more because of thy shame when I am
pacified toward thee for all that thou have done, says the Lord God* Thus the
love of God draws all to repentance, and it prevails more with them to bring
them to repentance, than to hear of the wrath of God, and judgments: and this
repentance is a true ^^pentance, to hate sin, and to be humbled for it,
because it offends so loving a Go^ and therefore to forsake them, though ne^^
so near and dear to us: and be afraid of committing sin for fear of
offending God. (...) Joseph said, How can I do this, and sin agai^^ God,
Genesis 39.9.

Object. If it be so that God does draw (...) men thus to himself, what is the
reason the all do not come unto him; for we see the most keep from him, and
live in sin and wi^^ednesse?

Answ. The fault is in man. O man! thy^^struction is of thy self; For what
co^^ I have done to my Vineyard that I have (...) done it, Isa. 5.4. And though
they go a^^ from Christ, yet he will not leave thems^^^ he follows them, 1
Cor. 10.4. They did (...) drink the same spiritual drink; for the drank of
that spiritual rock that follow^^ them: and that roche was Christ.

He follows them with his mercy and ^^ving kindness to draw them to him,
but the would not. Ye would not come unto me, th^^ might have life. And, if ye
believe not that I^ he, ye shall dye in your sins, John 8.24.

There is nothing that condemns the wo^^ but the rejecting and undervaluing of
Je^^ Christ, and continue so doing, and live and dye so. He that believes not
is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only
begotten Son of God. And this is condemnation that light is come into the
world: and men loved darkness rather than light, John 3.18, 19.

Christ is the light to lighten every one that comes into the world: and he
invites all to come unto him, and he will give them of his light that they
might see to walk in his way, and he would direct them what to do, and lead
them in the way to life eternal: but they continue, refusing and loving their
own darkness better then the light or Jesus Christ, and hate him in his waves,
and persecute him in his members, and make a mock of godliness, and think to
get a righteousness of their own that shall carry them to heaven: and so they
undervalue the righteousness of Christ, and tread under foot the Son of
God, and count the blood of the Covenant wherewith he was sanctified, and
unholy thing; they do not regard it, but slight it, and do not really believe
him. And he that does not believe the Son, shall not see life, but the wrath
of God abides on him, John 3.36. He that believes not God, has made him a
liar, because he believes not the record that God gave of his Son, 1 John
5.10. It is the free mercy and love of God tha^ is offered to all: it is that
that shall condem^^^ all those that continue always in unbelief Christ came
near Jerusalem, and wept o^^ it, and said: O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that
killest the Prophets and stonest them that are sent ^^to thee: how often would
I have gathered thy children together, as a hen does gather her brood ^^der
wings, and ye would not, Luke 13.34. Mat. 23.37. And in Mat. 23.31. there we
may s^^ what children these were that he would ha^^ gathered to him. Ye be
witness unto your selv^^ that ye are the children of them that killed the
Prophets, and they commit the same sin as their Fathers did. In the 34. and 35.
verse of this chapter; Behold, I send unto you Prophets, and wise men, and
Scribes: and some of them ye^ shall kill and crucify, and some of them shall
ye^ scourge in your Synagogues, and persecute the^ from City to City. That
upon you may come al^^ the righteous blood shed upon the earth; from the blood
of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew
between the Temple and the Alter.

These are the children that Christ would have gathered to him, and his bowels
of compassion yearns to them. He wept over them to think what a miserable
condition they were in: and he would have preserved them from it, but they
would not. And thus he offers himself still to all, even the chiefest of
sinners, 2 Chronicles. 26.15, 16. And the Lord God of their Fathers sent to them by
his messengers, rising up betimes, and sending, because he had compassion on
his people, and on his dwelling place. But they mocked the messengers of God,
and despised his words, and misused his Prophets; until the wrath of the Lord
rose against his people, till there was no remedy. Prove. 1.24. to the 31.
Because I have called, and ye refused, I have stretched out my hand, and no man
regarded. But ye have set at naught all my counsel, and would none of my
reproof: I also will laugh at your calamity, I will mock when your fear
comes. When your fear comes as desolation, and your destruction comes as
a whirle-winde; when distress and anguish comes upon you: Then shall they
call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall
not find me: For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the
Lord. They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof. Therefore
shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own
deviecs.

Thus he strives with them till there is no remedy, and then he gives them
over. And when they have thus hardened their own hearts that they refuse all
instruction, and shut their eyes that they will not see; then God hardened
their hearts as he did Pharaoh's, Exodus 10.1. and blind their eyes, Mat. 13.14,
15. By hearing ye shall hear, and not understand, and seeing ye shall see, and
not perceive. For this peoples heart is waxed gross, and their ears are du^^
of hearing, and their eyes they have closed, lest at any time they should see
with their eyes, and heart^ with their ears, and should understand with their
hearts, and should be converted, and I should he^^ them. And therefore he spoke
to them in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing, they might
not understand, Luke 8.10. Isa. 6.9. Mark. 4.12. God has given them th^^
spirit of slumber; eyes that they should not see, an^ ears that they should
not hear, Romans 11.8. S^^ the fault is in the creature, and not in God; for
this good seed is sown in all sorts of ground; in good ground, and in that
which is stony, and that which is thorny, and by the way side: so it is sowed
in all, and the fault is not in the seed; for the seed is all alike.

That seed is the word of God, Luke 8.11. which is sown in all mankind. He
that was the unprofitable servant had received a talent of his Lord as well as
the profitable servants. So God has justified himself, and left the world
without excuse, that they shall have nothing to say for themselves at the day
of judgment: and this is that that will be their greater condemnation Those
mine enemies that would not that I bold reign over them, bring them and slay
them before my face, Lu. 19.27. Not to have Christ ^eigne over them, is that
which condemns them.

CHAP. VIII. How God does compel those that are his children to come in to him.
GOd has chosen and elected some before the world began, to be the children
of God in Christ, and to reveal himself unto them, and to give unto them
eternal life, ^aving predestined us unto the adoption of ^hildren by Jesus
Christ to himself, according ^o the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of
^he glory of his grace, wherein he has made ^s accepted in the beloved, Ephesians.
1.5, 6 According to the eternal purpose which he has purposed in Christ Jesus
our Lord, Ephesians. 3.11. Who has saved us and called us with an holy calling,
not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace which
was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began. But is now made manifest
by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who has abolished death, and
has brought life and immortality to light through the Gos^^ 2 Timothy 1.9, 10.

God did not see any thing in us where to love us, but he loves us in his Son
fre^^ for his Sons sake. Christ has obtained (...) things of his Father both
in heaven and ear^ for us, and there is not any thing that (...) keep them
from us, and at the time appoi^ted of the Father, they shall be revealed to
(...) But the heir as long as he is a child, differs (...) thing from a
servant, though he he Lord of (...) Gal. 4.1. Before we be called with that
ho^^ call, which is that new work wrought in (...) which is alone the work of
the spirit, to (...) borne again, not of corruptible seed, but of
in^^ruptible, by the word of God which lives and ^^bideth for ever, 1 Pet.
1.23. Except a man borne of water and of the spirit, he cannot e^^ into the
kingdom of God, John 3.5.

Before we be thus called, we differ nothin^ from those that are but servants:
but when (...) are called by this new work wrought in^^ which is the time
appointed of the Father then he will make known to us what he ha^^ prepared
for us before the world began: and (...) were heirs to it when we were dead in
sins a^ trespasses: but did not then make it known (...) us: and to all these
he will give eternal li^^ I give unto them eternal life, and they shall ne^^
perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. My Father which gave
them me is greater then all, and no man is able to pluck them out of my Fathers
hand, John 10.28, 29. Fear not little flock, it is your Fathers good pleasure
to give you the Kingdom. Thou have given him power over them, that he should
give eternal life to as many as thou have given him. And this is life
eternal, that they might know the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou
have sent, John 17.23. And it is he alone that does bring us to the knowledge
of himself. Jesus said, I am the way, the truth, and the life, no man comes
to the Father but by me, John 14.6. I am the Lord thy God which teaches thee
to profit, which leads thee the way that thou should go, Isa. 48.17. And
thine ear shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk in it,
Isa. 30.21.

And these that are his children, he will overpower them with his Spirit, and
make them come unto him. Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power,
Psalm. 110.3.

We are unwilling by nature to come to God: but when he comes with his
power, he will make us willing to do what he would have us. Mat. 22. Go ye
therefore out into the high ways, and as many as ye find compel them to come
to the marriage.

This was a spiritual compulsion; for no^ has the power to make them willing
but t^^ Spirit. The Magistrate does compel to a^^ outward conformity: but
that cannot ma^^ them willing: it is only the work of the spirit, and he will
compel all his children (...) come to this marriage, and make them willi^^ to
come.

CHAP. IX. It is the Spirit alone in us that does (...) in all.
PAul says, I desire not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ and
him cra^^^ed, 1 Cor. 1.2. For by him, he being crucifi^^ for us, he has
obtained al things for us: a^^ we cannot know that Christ was crucified (...)
us, nor any thing what he has done for (...) but by the Spirit of God, we may
believe ma^^ things to be truth; because it is writ in the Scripture, and
because many say it is tru^^ but this is but the hearing of the ear; and no^
knows it to be truth by the hearing of the ea^^ as the truth is in Jesus, but
by the Spirit^ God alone. For what man knows the things a man, save the
spirit of man which is in him? Even so the things of God knows no man, but
the Spirit of God, 1 Cor. 2.11.

This spirit of man must be one with man, or else it cannot understand the
things of man, as the thoughts, and mind, and will, and desires of man, which
is one and the same with man: so the Spirit of God is one and the same with
God, or else it could not know the things of God. But this spirit knows all
things of God; For the Spirit searches all things, yea the deep things of
God, 1 Cor. 1.10. And this Spirit God has given unto us: Now we have not
received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might
know the things that are freely given to us of God. And verse. 12. of this Chap.
God has revealed them to us by his Spirit. And verse. 10. So Christ has done
all things for us, and has obtained all things for us, and we cannot know
^his without his Spirit: and therefore he has and will give us his Spirit,
that we may know ^t, and have the enjoyment of it. Man as man ^s not able to
understand the things of God; because man is carnal, and the things of God ^re
spiritual: and a carnal apprehension cannot apprehend spiritual things. The
natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are
foolishness unto him; neither can he know them, because they are spiritually
discerned, 1 Cor. 2.14.

As we are natural, we cannot know the things of the Spirit, we are not able
to discern them. The eye of man has not seen, nor the ear of man heard;
neither has it entered into the heart of man the things which God has
prepar^^ for them that love him, 1 Cor. 2.9. All the excellencies of man cannot
bring us to know an^ thing of the mystery of God; for every man i^ beast by
his own knowledge, Jer. 10.14. Jer. 51*17. I understood as a beast, says
David. How (...) that? according to a carnal apprehension, an^ a carnal
imagination; for the highest and mo^^ excellent thoughts that we as we are men
(...) have of God, is but according to our carnal imagination. All the wisdom
of man is b^^ foolishness with God, 1 Cor. 2.20. Therefo^^ his wisdom cannot
bring him to know the things of God; nor humane learning cann^^ do it; for
then the Scribes and Pharisees, an^ the high Priests and Elders would have
know^ Christ: but they said: Which of us has be^^ved him at any time. And Paul
had a great d^^ of humane learning, yet that did not bri^^ him to know God; for
he was a persecuter (...) the Church of God, Gal. 1.13. Yet none (...) the
Apostles had so much humane learning (...) he; yet he did not come to know the
mind (...) God, and the things of God, by the teachings of man. Now I certify
you, brethren, that the Gospel which was preached of me was not after man. For
neither received I it of man, neither was I taught it but by the revelation of
Jesus Christ, Gal. 1.11, 12. So it was by the Spirit of God revealed in him;
that brought him to know the things of God. For ye see your calling, brethren,
how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble are
called. But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the
wise: and God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the mighty
things. And vile things of the world, and things which are despised, has God
chosen: yea, and things which are not, to bring to naught things that are. That
no flesh should glory in his presence, 1 Cor. 1.26, 27, 28, 29. God strips us
of all the excellence of the flesh, lest we should think by any thing that is
of us, brings us to the knowledge of God, and so we idolize it: but the
excellence of man is but flesh, even the best of it, as all outward gifts
without the Spirit of God, 1 Cor. 13.1, 2, 3. Though I speak with the tongues
of men and Angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a
tinckling cymbal.

And though I had the gift of prophecy, and knew all secrets, and all
knowledge: yea, and if I had all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and
have not love, I were nothing. And though I feed the poor with all my goods;
and though I give my body that I be burned, and ho^^ not love, it profits me
nothing. All this without love, which is the Spirit; For God and the Spirit is
one, 1 John 5.7. God is love, 1 John ^.8. All these excellent things without the
Spirit profieth me nothing. Why? because our happiness consists alone in God,
and not in excellent cutward gifts without him, Paul ha^ a great many before
his conversion, yet h^ looked upon them as the works of the flesh for he had
not then the Spirit of God. For we are the Circumcision which worship Go^ in
the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, an^ have no confidence in the flesh;
Though I al^ might have confidence in the flesh. If any man thinks that he
has whereof he might t^^ in the flesh; much more I: Circumcised the eighth day
of the kindred of Israel, of the tr^^ of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews, by
the Law a Pharisee. Concerning zeal: I perse^ted the Church, touching the
righteousn^^^ which is in the Law, I was unrebukeable. B^ things that were
vantage to me, the sam^ counted loss for Christ's sake. Yea doubtle^ I think
all but loss for the excellent knowled^ sake of Christ Jesus my Lord. For wh^^
I have counted all things loss, and dee (...) them to be dung, that I might
win Christ: and might be found in him; that is, not having mine own
righteousness which is of the Law, but that which is through the faith of
Christ, even the righteousness which is of God through faith, Phil. 3.3. to
the 9. All flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man is as the flowr of
grass. The grass withers, and the flower falls away: but the word of the
Lord endures for ever, 1 Pet 1.24, 25.

This glory of the flesh which is compared to the flower of the grass, is the
righteousness of man, the most excellent of man without the Spirit of God, as
Paul had. Yet this must all fall away, it cannot stand before the
righteousness of Jesus Christ: but the word of God endures for ever. This
word is Christ, and he and his righteousness endures for ever, and when he
and his righteousness appears in us, and to us: It will appear so glorious,
and shine with such a burning heat, that it will wither the flower of our
righteousness, and cause it to fall away, and be brought to nothing. It will
appear so odious and filthy in our fight, that we shall be ashamed of it, as
Paul was, and count it as dung and dross, the filchiest things as is: and so
we shall be desirous to have this righteousness of ours destroyed by the
glorious coming of Jesus Christ by g]DESC="missing" EXTENT="1 span" Spirit
into us. So none of the best of the excellencies of man can bring us to know
any thi^ of God in the mystery; it is alone the work (...) the Spirit of God
without any thing of us. T^^ things of God knows no man, but the Spirit (...)
God, 1 Cor. 2.11. And this Spirit searches (...) things, yea, the deep things
of God, verse. 10.

1. It is the Spirit alone that sees the thing of God. 2. It is the Spirit that
hears the things (...) God. 3. It is the Spirit alone that understand^ the
things of God. 4. It is the Spirit alone that can do the works of God. 5. It
is the Spirit alone that makes us accepted with God.
For the first, It is the Spirit of God alo^^ that sees the things of God.
Mat. 6.22. The light of the body is the eye: If therefore thine eye (...)
single, thy whole body shall be full of light, Lu. 11.3^^ This single eye is the
Spirit of God, and it se^^ the things of God; for it cannot be the eye (...)
man, Matthew. 6.23. But if thy eye be evil, the whole body shall be full of
darkness. If therefo^^ the light that is in thee be darkness; how great
(...) that darkness?

The eye is that whereby we see; the eye (...) man cannot see any thing but
that which i^^ man: and all the things of man, even the best of them are but
evil: and the eye of man that sees the things of man, is one and the same
with man. And therefore it must needs follow, that the eye of man is evil; for
it sees nothing done but that which is evil. And if thy eye be evil, thy
whole body shall be full of darkness.

What is darkness but want of light: and the light is Jesus Christ. This is
the condemnation that light is come into the world: and men loved darkness
rather than light, John 3.19. And the light shined in darkness, and the
darkness comprehended it not, John 1.5. And that was the true light which
lights every man that comes into the world. He was in the world, and the
world was made by him, and the world knew him not, John 1.9, 10.

So as we are men we cannot know God, nor any thing of God. For if that light
that is in us be darkness, how great is that darkness? If those most
excellent performances of man, as man without the Spirit of God, as Paul did
perform before his conversion, which is most likest light, be darkness, how
great is that darkness that man is in? Man, as man cannot comprehend the
light of Jesus Christ: none can do it, but that which is one and the same with
him, which is the Spirit of God: and he ^s that single eye that sees all the
things of God and Christ, for they are one: and Christ (...) promised to send
his Spirit unto us. But Comforter which is the holy Ghost, whom the they will
send in my Name, he shall teach y^^ things, and bring all things to your
remember whatsoever I have said unto you, John 14.^ When the Comforter is come,
whom I will send (...) you from the father, even the spirit of truth o^
proceeds from the Father, he shall testify o^ Joh 15.26. The spirit of truth
whom the world (...) not receive, because is sees him not, neither kno^^ him:
but ye know him, for he dwells with and shall be in you, and he shall abide
with for ever, John 14.16, 17.

These words Christ spoke to his Disci^^ when he was present with them in the
sha^ man, when he was to depart from the^ that bodily shape, they were
unwilling (...) he should go away: but he tells them that expedient that he
should go away. For if (...) not away, the Comforter will not come: but
depart, I will send him unto you, John 16.^

So when he departed from them in the ^^dy, he did send his Spirit to them:
and only to them, but to all his children, to and of the world. He shall abide
with you ^^ver; I will not leave you comfortless, I will to you, John 14.18.

So he departed from them in flesh, and (...) unto them in Spirit, and
remains with his Church for ever, and is a greater Comforter ^o his Church in
Spirit, than he was to his Disciples in his flesh when he was with them. ^o
Christ has given us his spirit freely, that we ^ay see the things that are
freely given to us ^f God. So, in thy light, says David, we see light. Though
we, as we are men, cannot see the things of God: but as we are Saints, and
have ^he Spirit of God, so we come to see the things of God; for the Spirit of
God in us sees the things of God: and so far as he reveals the things of
God to us, so far we see them with his s;pirituall eye of himself. The Lord
is my ^ight, Psalm 27.1. So in this light we see God who is light. For ye were
sometime darkness, ^ut now are ye light in the Lord, Ephesians. 5.8. For thou
art my lamp, O Lord: and the Lord will ^ighten my darkness, 2 Samuel 22.29.

So far as God has revealed himself to ^n, so far we have seen him with
the light of himself: And so far as we have not seen him with the light of
himself, so far we are ^n darkness still: and so far as he has revealed
himself to us, he teaches us all things, and brings all things to our
remembrance. For therefore he was sent unto us, to teach us to know what
Christ has done for us, and to know the things that are freely given to us of
God, and to be our Comforter. There is (...) Comforter like this; for he is
always in (...) and knows our trouble; there is not any thi^ hid from him; for
we have not an high Pr^^^ which cannot be touched with the failing (...) our
infirmities: but was in all points temp^^ like as we: and yet without sin, Heb.
4.1^ For in that he himself has suffered being templ^ he is able to succor
them that are tempted, H^^ 2.18.

Christ has suffered in all manner of afflic^^^ons both spiritual and
temporal; therefore his Spirit is a sufficient Comforter to comfo^^ us in all
our troubles with the love of himself and in upholding us in it, and to bring
us (...) of them when he sees it is for his glory and (...) good. Thus the
Spirit sees the things (...) God.

For the 2d. It is the Spirit alone that hear^ the things of God. He that has
an ear to hea^ let him bear, Mat. 13.9. M^r. 4.9. He that ha^^ an ear let him
bear what the Spirit says unto t^^ Churches, Rev. 2.7.

It must be such an ear as can hear what the Spirit faith. It is only the
Spirit that can he^^ the Spirit speak, and that knows the language^ the Spirit,
and none else: man may or can h^^ what man speaks: and of the mind of Go^ as
it is writ in Scripture: and to hear it in the letter, as it is in the letter:
but to hear it so as to understand, and know what it is in the truth of it, as
the truth is in Jesus; none knows it but the Spirit of God, for it is
spiritual. The word that I spoke unto you is Spirit and life: and this word is
Christ. And the word was made flesh and dwelt among us: and we beheld his glory
(...) of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth, Joh. 1.14. In
the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God,
John 1.1. So this word is spiritual; for God is a Spirit, John 4.24. And none
can hear this word but that which is one and the same with it: and therefore it
is only the Spirit of God, which is one and the same with God, which has that
hearing ear, to hear what the Spirit says: and this Spirit of God hears all
the mind of God, yea all the secrets of God; He does hear what things they are
that God has prepared for them that love him: and those things the ear of
man, as man, cannot hear what they be; for they are spiritual and heavenly,
glorious things: and man is carnal, and cannot hear them, so as to understand
it. It is a strange language to him, he does not know the meaning of it;
therefore he has declared all things to his Spirit, and has given us his
Spirit: and so this Spirit of God in us does hear the Spirit speak: it
speaks nothing but peace and love and mercy, and go^^ will to us, and what he
has done for us, (...) what he is in us, and to us, and what we are (...) him,
and to him, as we are Saints: and (...) Spirit will declare it to us by
degrees, that (...) we are Saints we shall know them; for the^^fore the Spirit
was sent to us, that thro^^ him we may hear what God has done for (...)

Thus have I showed you in some meas^^ that it is alone the Spirit of God that
hear^^ the things of God for us.

For the 3d. It is the Spirit of God alo^^ that understands the things of God;
for m^^^ as man cannot understand the things of Go^ because they are
spiritually discerned, 1 G^^ 2.24. And man is altogether earnall. Mat. 1^.13.
They seeing, see not, and hearing, bear n^^ neither do they understand, Isa.
6.9. Mark. 4.1^ John 12.40. Acts 28.26. How can they u^^derstand that which
they can neither see n^^ hear.

When Christ told his Apostles that he m^^ go to Jerusalem, and all things
that are writ^ by the Prophets concerning the Son of M^n f^^ be accomplished.
For he shall be delivered unto (...) Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and
spightfully (...) treated, and spit on. And they shall scourge (...) and put
him to death, and the third day he sh^^ rise again. And they understood none
of thing, and this saying was hid from them, neither ^new they these things
that were spoken, Luke 18.^1, 32, 33, 34.

They were the Apostles of Jesus Christ, and ^^e chose them among his
Disciples, to go and ^^reach the Gospel to all the world; yet they, (...) they
were men, they understood not those ^^ings in the mystery what should be
brought (...) pass by those things. They could not choose (...) know what those
things meant outward^y, when he told them so plainly, what things ^e must
suffer; for they could do no other but ^now those things outwardly: but those
say^^gs spiritual were kept from them, that they ^^derstood them not. For man
as man cannot understand any thing but that which is of ^^n. For the things of
God knows no man. He ^ay hear much with the ear, and speak much (...) that
which he has heard, as the Eunuch ^^d; he read in the Prophet Isaiah, and
Philip ^^ent to him, and heard him read: and he said ^^to him, Understand
thou what thou read? (...) he said, how can I, except some man guide me,
(...) 8.30, 31. The heart of man is darkened, that (...) cannot understand the
things of God, Romans 1.^1. And that which is darkness, cannot com^^hend light:
therefore the Eunuch said, how (...) I understand. Can flesh understand the
spi^^t? for they are contrary one to the other. For we have need of one to
teach us: and it is o^^ the Spirit of God that does know: and the^^^fore it is
he alone that can teach us; for (...) does know all things of God, for he is
(...) with him, and is the very God, therefore (...) knows all things. For he
searches all things, (...) the deep things of God, 1 Cor. 2.10. As m^ has an
eye to see, and an ear to hear, and heart to understand, and other members
su^^ble for man to see, and hear, and understan^ and perceive the things of
man. So for (...) weak capacity God is set forth to us in (...) Scripture by
those things, as an eye to see, b^^cause he sees all things. Neither is there
(...) creature that is not manifest in his sight, (...) all things are naked
and opened unto the eyes of (...) with whom we have to do, Heb. 4.13. And* he
is said to have an eye to see all our actio^ and he also sees all the things
of God in (...) truth of them, as the truth is in Jesus. A^ therefore he is
said to have an eye, because (...) the eye we see: and so an ear to hear. W^^
you are in trouble, call upon me, and I will he^^ The eyes of the Lord are upon
the righteous, and^ ears are open to their cry, Psalm. 30.15. He h^^reth all
things, both the things of God wh^^ are spiritual, and all things else: so he
is sai^ have an ear, because by the ear we hear* for our weak capacity God
is said to have ear, because he hears all things. And so he is said to have
a heart; for with the heart we come to understand, think, know and believe
the things of man. I know the thought that I have to you, says the Lord;
thoughts of peace, and love, and good will, Isa. 55.8. My thoughts are not as
your thoughts. Psalm. 139.17. How precious also are thy thoughts unto me O God,
how great is the sum of them.

So the Lord has thoughts toward us: but we, as we are men, know them not:
and he understands all the ways of man, and knows them, for he is the maker of
man, therefore he must needs know all the ways of man, and he also knows all
the things of himself: and none can know the things of God, but that which is
one with God, and that is alone the Spirit of God: and he does understand, and
^hinke, and know, and believe the things of God.

For the first; he does understand the things of God. He it is that does
understand the truth of those things that he does see and hear. There is a
secret mystery in all the things of God, and it is all hidden from man: as man
^e does not, nor cannot know any of them, ^or understand any thing of them: but
the Spirit of God does understand them all, even ^he most secret things of all,
and all those excellent things that the Spirit of God does se^ and hear, and
understand what the truth of it is; they are all purchased by Christ for the
children of God, and is all kept in store is Christ for us, to be revealed by
this Spirit i^ us and to us at the time appointed of the Father. So the Spirit
of God being given to (...) makes us Saints: so as we are men, we understand
not any thing of God; yet as we an^ Saints, and have the Spirit of God, this
spirit in us understands all the things of God: an^ so by degrees reveals it
in us, and to us; th^^ as we are Saints, we understand the mind (...) God,
and those things that are laid up in sto^^ for us: and this Spirit of God does
think the thoughts of God, it thinks all the excelle^ thoughts that God
thinks; for it knows alone the thoughts of God, what he has to hi^ children
in the purity of them. So though (...) we are men, we cannot think the
thought of God, nor any thing aright of God; ye^ this spirit of God in us,
knows all the thought of God to us, and it thinks those thoughts o^ God that
God would have. It thinks, and s^ by degrees reveals in us as we are Saints,
wha^ the thoughts of God to us are, and this Spirit (...) God knows all the
things of God; he does n^only understand what the meaning of th^^^ things are
that he sees and hears, but h^^ knows them to be very truth, because he is
one and the same in it; therefore man cannot know any thing of God. For as he
is man, he is not one with God: and to know, is to be certain that it is so;
and how can man be certain that that is truth that he can neither see nor
hear, nor understand it to be so: But the Spirit of God is one with God;
therefore he knows it to be truth; for he searches all things, and knows
them all; yea the deep, and most secret things of God: and all is for the
Saints. So the spirit in us knows all the things of God, though man as man is
quite ignorant, and knows not any thing of the ways of God: so this Spirit
brings us as we are Saints, to know the things of God in his time. Prove. 2.5,
6, 7. Then shall thou understand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge
of God. For the Lord gives wisdom: out of his mouth comes knowledge and
understanding. He lays up sound wisdom for the righteous.

This Spirit does bring us to know God; for we must first know God, before we
can know the things of God: so the Spirit leads us in that way that brings us
to know God, and that way is Christ Jesus; for through him we know God, and
he brings us to the knowledge of Jesus Christ; which to know him, is to know
the fullness of our happiness; for out of him God is an enemy to us: but in
him, God is as well pleased with us as he is with Christ; for through him we
have free passage to go to God: and Paul prizes the knowledge of Christ above
all things in the world. Phil. 3.8. Yea, doubtless I count all things but
loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I
have suffered the loss of all things: and do count them but dung that I might
win Christ, and be found in him, For to know Jesus Christ, is to know al
things; for we cannot know him as he is: but we shall know what we are in him.
Ephesians. 1.17, 18. That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory may
give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him. The
eye of your understanding being enlightened, that we may know what is the hope
of his calling, and what is the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the
Saints.

The spirit in us knows all things, and he^ believes all the things of God:
and none can do it but he, because none knows the things of God but he, and
those things that he does see, and hear, and understand what they are, and
knows them to be truth; therefore the Spirit believes them: and this faith is
a perfect faith; he believes fully all things of God in every tittle; there is
no imperfection in it; he believes all things that Christ has done for us,
and what he has obtained for us.

Thus the Spirit of God in us believes all the things of God for us: and
without this faith we cannot be saved; for by this faith we are justified. This
faith is that eye that sees all the things of God; for it sees all things that
Christ has done for us: and we, as we are men, we cannot believe the things of
God, because they are spiritual, and we are carnal, and cannot know
spiritual things, therefore we cannot believe them; for it is impossible to
believe that which they do not know: but though we, as we are men and women,
do not, nor cannot believe, yet the Spirit of God in us does believe perfectly
all the things of God for us. So as we are Saints, we believe the things of God
through the Spirit of God. God would have man to be saved, and that he should
come to the knowledge of his truth, and believe what Christ has done for him,
and lay hold on Christ by faith that he might be saved: but man cannot do it;
therefore God sent his Spirit to us, that he should do it for us in us: so by
this faith we are justified, for this is perfect: and we may have this spirit
in us that does believe God in Christ: and we, a^we are men, know it not; yet
the spirit of God is always the same with God: and in his time he will make
known in us and to us, a^ we are Saints, that we have this saving justifying
faith in u^^and make known in us by degrees what our pledges are in him.

4thly. It is the Spirit of God alone that can do the works of God; man cannot
do any thing that can please God; for all the worke^ of man as man are evil
continually. Even the best performances that he can perform, a^^ those
performances that Paul performed before his Conversion; For all that is not
faith i^ sin: and man as man has not faith, therefore all his works are
evil: and that which (...) evil cannot please God: and the way of God is past
man's finding out, John 6.28, 29. Wh^^ shall we do, that we might work the
works (...) God? Jesus answered and said unto them, This (...) the work of
God, that ye believe in him whom (...) has sent.

This is the work of God, and it is only the Spirit of God that can do it in
man, so man. We do just as the Apostles did, whe^^ they went a fishing, when
Christ was abse^ from them, they toyled and labored all the night to get
fishes, and could get none. B^^ when Christ came to them, he bid them (...)
down the net on the right side of the shipp^^ and; e^ shall find: and they
were not now able (...) draw the net for the multitude of fishes, John 2^ 6. So
we labor and toil our selves in the night, that is, before the light of
Jesus Christ appears to us, that we may see him present with us by his
Spirit: we labor in our own way and strength to do those things that should
please God: but we labor on the wrong side of the ship, all our labor is
in vain, there is nothing to be gotten: but Christ coming to us by his
Spirit, to tell us the net must be cast in on the right side, that is, in a
spiritual way; for we have labored in a carnal way, and could find nothing.
And what is this net but that which catches something: so the Spirit of God,
he cast in the net that way that God would have him for us: he does the whole
work of God, in believing Jesus Christ, and performing all obedience to him
for us in us: and he makes known to us by degrees what the mind of God is:
and so we find in us that he does those things in us, that he does reveal
to us that we should do it: and as we are men, we cannot do it: so he does
it in us, making use of the members of man as instruments to perform the
works of God: and he makes us willing to yield to him, for he over-powers us,
and so God accepts of it: so the spirit casting in the net of right
performances to God in us, he brings forth to us from God through Jesus
Christ, such a multitude of several manifestations of the love of God to us in
Christ Jesus, and showing us what we are in him, that we are not able to draw
them forth; we cannot comprehend them as we are men: so for us to labor on
the wrong side of the ship is in vain. Isa. 49.4. Then said I, I have labored
in vain, I have spent my strength for naught, and in vain; yet surely my
judgment is with the Lord, and my work with my God, Deuteronomy. 32.4. He is the
rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth,
and without iniquity, just and righteous is he.

Thus the Spirit of God does the works of God for us in us, and we have the
comfort of it: and it is he alone that does make us accepted with God.
Wheresoever there is a manifest appearance of the Spirit of God in any one,
there he purges and sanctifies that man or woman in their conversation, by his
acting in them: and this Spirit of God seasons those actions that he acts in
us, making use of our members: and our members being carnal and fleshly, the
acting of the spirit through us cannot appear so pure and excellent as it is
in it self; for it is clouded with the veil of our infirmities: but the
Spirit seasons the acting that he acts through our flesh, and so he makes
them accepted with God. This is the Altar that sanctifies the offering; Christ
is ^oth a King, a Priest, and a Prophet, and he ^ath made us so with him as we
are Saints. He ^as a Priest to offer sacrifice for all: and this ^acrifice that
he did offer was his body: and ^he Altar that he did offer it on was his
divini^y: and this Altar sanctifies the sacrifice, Mat. ^3.19. So this Spirit
of Christ which is one ^ith God in us, sanctifies all those perfor^ances that
he acts through us, they are offe^ed all of them upon the Altar of his
Divinity, and so are accepted with God: so the Spirit ^akes us accepted with
God.

CHAP. X. ^he Spirit of God makes the way of God plain and easy to us.
THe way of God is very hard for man to find out; it is a straight narrow way,
that ^an as man cannot go in it; for all the ways (...) man are crooked: and
that which is croo^d cannot enter into a straight narrow place: (...) man
cannot find the way of God. When christ came before he taught the people
him^^^fe through his own person, he sent a fore^^nner to prepare the way
before him. Malac. 3.1. Behold, I will send my messenger, and (...) shall
prepare the way before me: and the (...) whom ye seek shall suddenly come
into his Te^^^^ even the messenger of the Covenant whom ye deli^ in: behold he
shall come says the Lord of h^^

This messenger was John Baptist, Mat. 3.^ For this is he that was spoken of by
the Prophet (...) saiah, saying: The voice of one crying in the (...) dernesse,
prepare ye the way of the Lord, make (...) paths straight, Isa. 40.3.

The way and paths of the Lord are strei^^^ in it self, and to the Spirit of
God: but i^ crooked to man, that man cannot find it (...) So this messenger did
prepare the way (...) Christ: and how did he prepare the way (...) by preaching
the word of God, which (...) Christ, that he was the Savior, and w^^ he would
do to them; that he would bap^ them with the holy Ghost and fire: and ^tels
them that himself was not the Christ, J^^ 1.20. lest the people should Idolize
him. (...) comes but to prepare the way for Christ; (...) were not to continue
there, but to look ^ther to Christ himself; for John was b^^ prepare the way
for him. John was filled (...) the holy Ghost from his mothers womb, Luke 1.^
and so he was sent to prepare the way, (...) the people might know that Christ
wa^ Messiah: and when he should make kn^^ himself to them, they should hear
and believe him. Yet John as he was a man, he did not ^now whether Christ was
the Messiah or no, Mat. 11.2, 3. Now when John had heard in the ^rison the
works of Christ be sent two of his Disciples, And said unto him, art thou he
that should come? or look we for another? Yet the holy Ghost in him did know,
and did prepare the way for Christ, John 5.35. John was a burning and a shining
light. That light of Jesus Christ that was made manifest by him, was the
greatest light that ever was revealed before: it appeared very glorious, and it
was to give light to others, and it burned up all that was contrary to it in
the children of God, so far as it was made manifest to them: and they rejoice
in this light; for it was the greatest light that ever they saw; yet this light
was but to prepare a way for a greater light: and then Christ did come, which
was the light it self, which did exceed that light which did appear by John,
though it was all one light; for it was all of the holy Ghost. John had it but
in measure, but Christ had it all in the fullness of it, and he was without
sin; therefore that light in him could not be eclipsed by any sin. He was the
Son of God, and the fullness of the Godhead dwelt bodily in him: so this light
of Jesus Christ appeared fuller, clearer, and more glorious than that of John:
and that glory (...) John gave place to the glory of Christ; fo^^ out-shined
that light that appeared so glo^^ous by him. And John said, He must incre^^
but I must decrease, Joh. 3.30.

The glory of Jesus being revealed more a^^ more in his Saints, does cause all
other glo^^ous manifestations that they had before, whi^^ is below this, though
as excellent as th^^ which was revealed by John, yet to decrease (...) but the
glory of Jesus Christ is always t^^ same in it self, but is increased and
ma^^ known in us more and more: and that glor^ of Christ appeared then so
glorious to the^^ that made them say, Never man spoke as th^^ man does, Joh
7.46.

Those that did believe in him were so taken in admiration of him with hearing
him, an^ seeing those miracles that he wrought, th^^ they were willing to
forsake all to follow him: no^ only outward things, but also their sins: and
all those things that were so excellent and precious to them as their own
righteousness and performances which they did look to ha^^ been justified
by: but now they were willing (...) forsake all to follow him. Yet when Christ
d^^ come in the flesh, and revealed himself in a great deal more clearer and
excellenter man-ner than he did by John; yet Christ came to prepare a way for a
further manifestation of ^is own glory to them in a clearer and great deal
more fuller and glorious manner. He ^ould have revealed himself to them in the
^ighest of his glory at once: but they were not able to bear it, therefore he
revealed himself to them by degrees as they were able ^o bear it; for by the
outward hearing and ^^^ing, and the Spirit working in them by de^rees, brought
he them to believe and em^race that light that was revealed to them by Christ:
So when they came in some measure ^o conceive, and understand, and believe that
which he came to declare to them; for he spoke (...) a plain and an easy way
to them, that so ^^ey might understand him: so when he had ^^ished all things
for all, then he departed ^^om them, and sent the holy Ghost to them (...)
declare to them that glorious light of Jesus Christ in the purity of it, and
what those ^^ings were that Christ taught them in the ^ysterie in some measure:
so the light of Jesus Christ was brought forth in a more glorious ^anner then
ever before: so they were not to ^^est upon any one of those manifestations of
^^sus Christ, and say, I will stay here, and ^^ll not desire any further
manifestation of Christ. But they were to walk in that light ^^y had, being
contented with it, and waiting upon Christ for a more fuller and clea^
manifestation of the light of him. So when (...) does come to us in Spirit, he
sends his messeger before him to prepare the way before hi^ which is some
manifestations of his Spirit i^ us, to show us some light of himself, and
(...) to make way for a further manifestation (...) himself and his glory in
us. Whatsoever wa^ have received of God by his Spirit, mak^ known the love of
God to us, though in new so small a measure, and that but seldom; (...) let us
rejoice in God that does reveal this (...) to us; For this is but preparing a
way to ^^veale himself in a more glorious way to (...) for where he does take
possession, there he (...) reign, and none can keep him from reigning and so
walk in that light that thou have, an^ be as well contented with that thou
have received of God, as if thou had more; still waiting patiently for a
further manifestation (...) himself to thee; for he will do it by degree by
his Spirit in his time in us: and ye shall s^ in some measure that he prepares
the way (...) the Lord for us; for the way of the Lord is to^^ hard for man to
find out: but he finds o^ the way for us, Ier. 10.23. I know that the w^ of
man is not in himself; it is not in man the walks, to direct his steps. It
is only the Spi^^ of God that can do it; for there are ma^^ stumbling blocks
to be taken out of the way, which is only the work of the Spirit to do; ^hen
there will be a pleasant way to walk in.

CHAP. XI. ^f the two seeds: Of the seed of the woman, and the seed of the
Serpent.
THe two seeds are a great stumbling block in our way, to hinder us, while we
come (...) some measure to discern the difference a^ight betwixt them, which
is the work of the spirit to do it: Our God revealing himself to (...) is
Children, and showing them the mystery ^f his ways in the truth of it in some
measure. ^e makes them isntrumental many times by ^is Spirit, to bring others
to know the things ^f God: and therefore he reveals himself to ^ome in a
greater measure, and in a more high^^ and glorious manner, and enables them to
^peake to us those things that God has made ^nowne to them, that others might
know the ^^ings of God: it is not because God loves ^^em better than he does
them that he has ^ot revealed himself too; for he is no respecter (...)
persons, for he loves all his children alike, ^ith the same love that he loves
Christ withal: but he makes them isntrumental for the go^^ of others.

When Christ was to suffer, he prayed to (...) Father, John 12.28, 29, 30.
Father glorify the Name: Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have
both glorified it, and will glorify (...) again. Then the people that stood
by and hea^^ it, said, that was a thunder; others said, an A^gel spoke to him.
Jesus answared, and said, T^^^ voice came not because of me, but for your
sak^^.

So the manifestations of the love of G^^ and the things of God made known to
an^ it is not only for their sake^, but also for ^ther^: so if the Spirit of
God work^ by the ^^strument in them that hears, they have (...) benefi^ of it:
But if the Spirit does not wi^^^ is us those things that are spoken to us, the
those things are truth, and belongs to us, the instrument cannot work upon us:
so let (...) hear the instruments speak, but it is the Spirit alone that can
witness. I shall in so^^ measure show you the difference of the t^^ seeds,
and leave the success to God. Genesis ^.15. I will also put enmity between thee
and t^^ woman, and between thy seed and her seed, (...) shall break thy
head, and thou shall bruise (...) heel.

The seed of the woman was Christ, Gal* ^ 16. and the seed of the Serpent was
the ^^vill. And seed is to be sown, and the nature of seed is to bring forth
that which is one and the same with it: There is the seed of God, which is one
and the same with God, which is Christ; not as he was man, but as he is God.
This is the good seed that is sown in all: and this seed which is spiritual
being sown in us which is the Spirit of God in us, is the seed of God, and it
is one with God: Now as a seed is but a small matter to the whole bulk: so the
seed of God in us is but in a small measure to that fullness which is in God
yet it is one with him, Mat. 13.30, 31. The Kingdom of heaven is like a grain
of mustards^^de which a man takes and sows in his field, Which indeed is the
least of all feeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs: and
it (...) a tree, so that the birds of heaven come and build in the branches
thereof.

This parable Christ spoke concerning the seed of God sown in his children;
that though they have this seed in a small measure: and that which they have
may lie hid a great while in them, that they cannot perceiv: it, nor do not
know whether they have it or no; ^et then God is making a way for a clear
manifestation to us, that it does begin to spring ^^rth in us, and he waters it
daily with the ^^reames of his own self, which is only that which does make
it grow, and the Son of righteousness shining upon it, makes it spring
forth, and grow by degrees, and flourish in (...) that it will appear very
glorious, for it is the seed of God, and it is like God, and it is God* And
this seed being sown in the children (...) God, he makes it fruitful; there
will b^ fruits suitable in some measure to the seed in (...) and more and more
as this seed grows up in (...)* it will appear more glorious, and will bring
forth fruits suitable to God, and over-pow^^ us, and bring our wills into
subjection (...) himself, that we shall be willing for him (...) reign over
us: and so far as he reveale^ himself to us with his power to overpower
(...)* we are willing to be what he would have (...)* and do what he would
have us do, so God accepts of it, and will reward us for it: so also there is
the seed of the Serpent that (...) sown in all mankind, by his overcomming
Adam, and so getting an interest in him and for him in all mankind. And the
seed of the Serpent which is the Devil (for it was he i^ the Serpent that
overcame Adam) is one an^ the same with the Devil, and he is also a Spirit:
and this seed of the Devil is sown by h^^ in all, Mat. 13.24, 25. The kingdom
of God (...) like a man which sowed good seed in his field: B^ while men slept,
there came his enemy, and so^^ tares among the Wheat, and went his way.

God did sow nothing in Adam but that good seed of himself; there was no
evil in him, he was made after the Image of God, for spiritual things; but
the Devil being the enemy of God, he envied man's happy condition, he came
and sowed that evil seed of himself in Adam and in all mankind, and his
seed in us, is the same as he is: though it be small in it self, yet it being
sown in us, it quickly takes root in us, and appears; for this comes
naturally, and there is nothing to let and hinder it from growing in us, except
the Lord does blast it by a new work wrought in us, which comes not by nature:
and the Devil does water this seed of himself in us with the streams of his
temptations, and causes it to flourish and grow: and it is the seed of
darkness, for there is no light in it; for Christ is the light, and out of
him there is no light: and this is that which opposes Christ, and is nothing:
but the greatest darkness that is, for there is not any light in it: and he
infusing daily more and more of his darkdesse into us, causes the seed of
himself to grow more and more by him: and this seed cannot be dead long: but
it will quickly appear and ^pring forth, that it will be seen by others: and
bring forth fruit suitable to the seed, and will grow by degrees to be a high
tree in wickedness, and be full of evil fruit: and though it be the seed of
the Devil in us that causes us to bring forth fruit to himself, yet it is w^
that must suffer for it; for he brings us to be willing to yield to him in all
things, and to be at his command, and to do what he would have us to do: so
his will becomes our will, and we are obedient to him, and delight in his
works of darkness. This is the gross se^d of the Devil, and we see it grow
up in a high degree in some, and would in a higher, but that the Lord
restraines them: and it spring^ forth in some measure in all.

There are seven degrees to grow in perfection in God: so there is also to grow
in evil, to be like the Devil in wickedness: and there is a coming to it by
degrees; some attain to the first degree in God by the Spirit of God, and some
to the second: and so go along by degrees, from one degree to another. Some
attaines to one degree, and some to another, by the revelation of the Spirit of
God in us: so the Devil immitates God; for the wicked spirit working in us,
and we yielding to it, and delighting in it, he brings us all from one degree
to another; some attaines to one degre^, and some to another, and so on to
perfection in sin to our own destruction. For sin wh^^ it is finished,
brings forth death, Romans 6.23. But the Lord restraines most people, that they
do not grow to that degree of sin as they would else attain unto: and many
attain^^ but to the first degree, and lives a perfect moral life: and those
that are the children of God, he blasts this seed of the Devil in them by the
seed of himself sown in them. Christ by his death did break the head of the
Serpent, the Devil, but not killed him: he paid a full price for all sins,
and obtained things of his Father for all: so that sin cannot do us any
harm if we have the faith of Jesus Christ in us; for this will make us hate
sin; it cannot keep us out of heaven: so he brake the Devils bead; for the
policy lies in the head: and it was the Devils policy to tempt man that he
might fall finally, and never rise again: and so to destroy for ever all
mankind. For God did say to Adam, In the day that thou eatest thereof, thou
shall dye the death, Genesis 2.17. And the Devil knew that there was no other way
to destroy mankind but that: so being fallen, the Lord did not restore him to
that condition that he was in at the first; being man was rebellious to God, he
must have afflictions, he must live in sorrow and trouble here, for sin
remains still in our conversations in ^ll degrees, while Christ by his Spirit
in us does sanctify us, and suppress sin in us by degrees; That sin shall
not reign in our mort^^ bodies, because we are not under the Law, which
threatens curses because we cannot keep it, but under grace, Romans 6.15.

But still there remains the seed of the Devil in us, and is as bad as ever
it was in it self and it does appear so in us, so far as it i^ not kept
under by the seed of God: so hi^ head is broke, his policy is brought to
naught for it is not that can destroy any of mankind Numb 21.8, 9. And the
Lord said unto Moses, make thee a fiery Serpent, and set it up for a sig^ that
as many as are bitten, may look upon it a^ live, So Moses made a Serpent of
brass, and s^ it up for a sign: and when a Serpent had bitten man, then he
looked to the Serpent of brass, a^^ lived.

This was a figure of Christ; for we w^^ stung with the Serpent the Devil,
and Christ was crucified upon a tree for all: and we are (...) look up to him
with the eye of faith, for he is that has pulled out this sting: and look^^
upon him, we see our selves healed by him. (...) has not destroyed the
Serpent, but he remai^ still: but he cannot hurt the children of Go^ for his
sting is pulled out: and it is for wan^ looking on Christ, that all are not
cured: (...) this seed of the Serpent in us which the e^^^ sowed in us through
our listening to him in Adam, is not destroyed wholly, but suppressed, as the
Canaanites, and Amorites, and Moabites, and the rest of the Nations that kept
possession of the Land of Canaan before the children of Israel went into that
Land, and God gave them possession of it. But when the children of Israel had
taken possession of the Land, their enemies were not wholly destroyed, but were
suppressed that they could not do what they would against the children of
Israel; they were kept there for the humbling of the children of Israel, and
many times they rose up against the children of Israel to destroy them: and by
this was made known the love, mercy, and power of God in delivering the
children of Israel from their intention against them: and in destroying their
enemies, though not all of them, yet suppressed them all, so as they could do
the children of Israel no harm: and at all timer, when they had got strength
again, and rose up against them, the Lord still kept them under, and destroyed
them by degrees, yet still some did remain, but their power was taken from
them that they could do them no harm. So it is with the seed of the Devil in
us; it rises many times against us to destroy us, breaking forth into open sin
in words and actions, being backed and moved to it with the Devils temptation:
but these enemies remain in ^^to humble us, and to show us the goodness (...)
God in suppressing them, and destroying th^^ by degrees, and taking that power
from th^^ that they shall not hurt us: but ye they shall not be utterly
destroyed; for if the Lord withdrawes his Spirit from us, this seed will
appear with as vile fruits in us as ever: and the fruits that this seed
brings forth in us, are all manner of sin and wickedness: and this is called
the fruits of the flesh, Gal. 5.19. Romans 1. What fruits had ye then in those
things whereof ye are now ashames? for the end of those things i^ death, Romans
6.21.

This is the gross seed of the Devil, and the kernel of the flesh: but the
Devil has a more seeming purer seed which he does sow in mankind also, that
is like the seed of God: and man as he is man does not know it from the seed
of God; for the Devil it a spirit, and knows the things of God, and the ways
of God, how they are make known to us: and he knows how to deceive us in
those things. The Devil goes about like a roaring Lion, seeking whom he may
devour, 1 Pet. 5.8. If he can b^^ devour us, he cares not how he does it: If
he sees that he cannot do it by the gross seed in us: if we hate that by some
glimps of the lo^^ of the Lord made known to us, or by the ha^^ that we see in
it, or for some by respects, that we will not follow those gross ways of
wickedness, he will not displease us; he has all manner of ways to dissert
us, and he will use that way as shall give us most content, whatsoever it be,
so he can but rob God, and deceive (...), he cares. If a gross way of
wickedness will not content us, nor a sinful mortal life, not nothing, but to
be religious, he will deceive (...) in that? For Satan himself is transformed
into an Angel of light, 2 Cor. 11.14. Into the likeness of it. He will
appear in a glorious righteousness to us, like the righteousness of Jesus
Christ, but is not: and this seed of the Devil is called the righteousness of
man, which grows up in man to a high degree at the last: but there is 7.
degrees to come to perfection in this: and some attain to one degree, and some
to another. Here is a high degree of the Devils policy, he tempted man, that
so he might fall finally by it: but Christ redeemed us, and so he cannot have
his will in that; for Christ has done all things for us, and has obtained a
perfect righteousness for us: and (...) says, Look unto me, and be ye
saved, all the ^^ds of the earth; for I am God, and there is none ^^se, Isa.
44.22.

Now seeing it is set forth so plainly to us, (...) without the righteousness
of Christ we shall not be saved, he comes and immita^^ the righteousness of
Jesus Christ to us, and (...) patches up a righteousness in us, and bring^^
forth to us, and tells us it is the righteousne^^^ of Jesus Christ, and without
it we shall not (...) saved: and he says, look unto this, and (...) ye saved.
And it is manifest that he does so^^ this in all mankind, and it does appear
i^ some measure or other in all; for those the are very wicked persons can say,
if I say prayers and the Creed, and go to Church and hea^^ the mysteries, and
receive the Sacrament, a^^ read, and the like, I shall be saved: so th^^ look
to be saved by their own performance* But this is the first degree of the
growth of the seed in us: and it comes by degrees to a gre^^ growth, as it did
in the Scribes and Pharisee^ and in Paul before his conversion, they (...) this
righteousness: and howsoever God do^^ make known his righteousness to us, the
righteousness of the flesh will immitate it. We (...) as those did that went
to build a City and To^er, whose top may reach to heaven, Gen, 11.(...) For we
labor to get a righteousness of (...) own performances that should reach to
h^^ven, should carry us to heaven, looking (...) be saved by it: and without it
we think (...) shall not be saved.

When we hear that if we go on in our (...) we cannot be saved: and if we
will be saved, we must leave them off, and do thus and thus: ^hen we go about
to do it in our own strength, and search our selves, and to repent of our sins.
And if we can be exceedingly humbled for our sins, and shed many tears, then
we are at quiet, then we think our sins are pardoned, and God is well pleased
with us, because we are thus humbled for them, and our sins are done away by
Christ: But if we cannot shed many fears for our sins, and be much cast
down for them; then we are much troubled because we cannot be no more troubled
for our sins: and say, If I could be thoroughly humbled for my sins, then there
were hopes of mercy for me: but now there is none, so long as my heart is thus
hardened. And thus we think to be saved by our own righteousness: and no
longer than we are performing duties, that we can have any peace of conscience:
and when we are very strict in performing duties, then we have peace and joy,
and this sets us eagerly on performances: and we look upon this, and see that
we have as we think performed these duties aright in some measure, as prayer,
and repenting, and hearing or reading, and the like. O then we rejoice in it,
and think God accepts of it: and if our sins at any time overmaster us, then we
labor exceedingly in our own strength to beat them down, and she^ many
tears to wash them away, according a the sin is in greatness. And when we
ha^^ got power over it, then we think God is we^^ pleased with us for striving
against our sinne^ and labor to perform the whole Law, and often examining
our selves whether we keep it or no, and wherein we break it: and for those
things wherein we feel in keeping it, w^ shed many tears for it, and we
think that pacifieth God: and now all our sins are done away by our
repentance, and then that place o^ Scripture comes in our mind. Behold, thou
art made whole, go away and sin no more, lest (...) worse thing befall thee.

And this makes us more strict in performing the Law, and think to be
justified by the strict performing of it. Thus thou go from out degree of
the righteousness of the flesh to another: and the higher degrees thou
attainest unto, the more thou buildest thy comforts on it; For if thou
neglectest prayer or other duties, at those times as thou usest to perform
them, thou art much troubled for it, and have not the comfort that thou have
when thou do observe and perform them at the time as thou usest to do.
What is this, but to build thy comfort upon thy performances? And this
righteousness the Scribes and Pharisees had in (...) very high degree: but
Christ told his Disciples, That except their righteousness exceed the
righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, they should not enter into the
kingdom of heaven. And this Paul had before his conversion. And the more the
Lord makes known himself in a glorious manner in his own righteousness, the
Devil will transform himself like unto it; that as we are men and women we
cannot discern betwixt them: and this seed of the Devil which is our
righteousness, is in all the children of God, even as the seed of God is in
us: And this righteousness of ours is called flesh, and it is an enemy
against God. The seed of God (...) us is called Spirit: and the seed of the
Devil (...) us, both the gross seed, and that seeming glorious seed is called
flesh, and there is a stri^ng and struggling in us betwixt them; for the ^eed of
God works mildly, and by degrees in (...), and receives the power from God, and
re^^nes all the praise to God; it would not have any thing ascribed to us in
the least degree; It makes no have, but is willing to stay the Lords ^easure,
Isa. 28.16. He that believes shall not ^^ke have. And it is the Spirit in us
that does ^elieve, and he does not make have that is wil^ing to wait upon God,
and stay his leisure, while he does manifest himself in us in that ^ay that
the Spirit does desire it for us. Cant. 2.7. I charge you O daughters of
Jerusalem, th^^ ye stir not up, nor waken my beloved until h^^ please.

He mak^ us wait patiently upon God, us^^ the means, as prayer, hearing, and
reading^ but not at all depend upon them, but to loo^^ higher, and see God
above it; yet he is ma^^ times pleased to manifest himself to us (...) his
Spirit in the means, and our comfor^ consists only in him who is the fullness
of o^^ happiness, and not in the strength of our pe^formances: but the
righteousness of man is (...) enemy to this; it will not stay the Lords le^
sure, but does strive and struggle with G^^ for that which it would have, and
cannot be (...) quiet while he has it, and will not let Go^ have the honor,
but keep it to their selve^ though God shall have it in words, but not deeds;
for if we think to be saved by it, an^ without it, we shall not be saved; do
we no^ ascribe the honor to our selves, because w^ perform that
righteousness that we look be saved by? And this is a great policy of the
Devil to destroy all mankind; for he sa^ that his first policy was brought
to nough^ Then he seeks to destroy us by our own ri^^^teousnesse, making us
believe that it is the ri^^^teousnesse of Christ; because without his
ri^^^teousnesse we shall not be saved, and so ma^^ ^s to depend upon it, and
take the honor from God, and ascribe it to our performanas, and keeps us from
desiring after the righ^ousnesse of Christ. And when as God says, ^ooke unto
me, and be ye saved from all the ends ^f the Earth. The Devil says, Look
unto this ^^ghteousnesse of the flesh, and see that ye have ^^at, and ye shall
be saved; for without it ye shall ^^t be saved. And this he does to rob God of
is honor, and to keep all mankind out of ^eaven: and he works it so
craftily in us, that ^^r, as we are men and women cannot perceive (...), we
cannot be brought to believe it; while God does show us it by his Spirit, it is
a very ^angerous thing: and the higher we grow in (...), the more dangerous it
is; for there is nothing under the Devil, that is so great an ene^ie to God as
our rightteousnesse; It is Anti^rist in the mystery, it opposes Christ in all
^s ways, and persecutes him in all his ways, and exalts it self in all his
ways above Christ, ^^d will not have Christ to reign over us in his ^^y, nor he
to save us, but that he would reign ^^r us in the Devils way, and that should
^^e us. And so long as we live to this righte^^nesse of our own, we live to
our selves, and (...) to Christ: and this seed is in all the chil^^en of God,
and the seed of Christ is hidden it in us, like gold that is mixed among a great
deal of dross, that it cannot appear so pa^^ to us as it is in it self; yet
that which is gold is without dross, and is excellent: even so, th^^ seed of
God in us is mixed with the seed of the Devil; yet that which is of God is
perfect, pure; there is no dross in it: but it cannot appear so to to us by
reason of that dross of o^^ righteousness mixed with it: and so far as there
is any thing in us and to us that, is of Jesus Christ made known to us, though
it be but in a small measure, it is real truth: but s^ far as it is not
real pure truth, as the truth (...) in Jesus; though it appear never so
gloriou^ that which has not the truth in it, is of An^^christ, the seed of
the Devil in us: but th^^ which is real truth, so far as it is truth, (...)
is of God, although it be mixed with fashood but this seed of the Devil which
he sowed (...) us through envy, to rob God of his honor and to destroy all
mankind, shall never d^^stroy the children of God; for Christ ha^^ broken the
head of the Devils policy: but the seed of the Devil shall not wholly be
destroyed in us, but God will get himself honor upon it by the discovering of
it by the pure ligh^ and clear manifestation of the truth of Ch^^ made known
to us by the Spirit, revealing (...) us what he is in us, and what we are in
hi^ By degrees he will make known his love to^ and as he does reveal himself
to us in his own righteousness, the ways of Antichrist will be discovered,
and his glory will outshine the glory of Antichrist, and it shall appear
gross darkness to it, and we shall be ashamed of it: and as the light of
Jesus Christ appears by his Spirit in us; that seeming excellent glorious
righteousness of our flesh (which is Antichrist, in the mystery in us, which
opposes light, and is nothing but that which is contrary to it) shall be
destroyed by the coming of Christ spiritually in us.

These two seeds are typif^^d out to us by Isaac and Ishmael, Gal. 4.22, 23.
For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bond-maid, the
other by a free woman. But be that was born by the bond-maid was after the
flesh: but he of the free woman was by promise. The son of the bondwoman,
which was Ishmad, did cypifie Antichrist in us; this comes by nature: and
Isaac which was borne of the free woman, was a type of the seed of God in us,
the Spirit of Christ which is borne in the new birth by promise, and not by
nature. But as then, he that was borne after the flesh, pe^f^cuted him that
was borne after the Spirit: even so it is now; nevertheless, what faith the
Scripture; C^st ou^ the bondwoman and her son; for the son of the bondwoman
shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.

The righteousness of man must not be purged, but c^st out; it persecutes
Christ, it shall not be heir with Christ: and all the promise^ of God is to
this seed of God in us, and it is this that God loves so dearly, Gal. 3.16. N^w
to Abraham and his seed were the promises made, He says, not to the seeds,
as speaking of many (...) but unto thy seed, as of one, which is Christ.

Abraham was a type of God, and Isaa^ (...) type of Christ: and the promises
are promised to this seed. Gen 17.7, 8. I will establish my Covenant between
me and thee, and thy seed after thee in their generations, for an everlasting
Covenant, to be God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee. And I will give
thee, and thy seed af^^^ thee, the Land wherein thou art a stranger; ev^^ all
the Land of Canaan for an everlasting possession: and I will be their God. And
verse. 21. of this Chapter, he says, My Covenant will I est^blish with Isaac.
And verse. 19. And I will establish my Covenant with him, an everlasting
Covenant, ^and with his seed after him.

All the promises are to Christ and his se^^ which is sown in the Saints, for
that i^ (...) with Christ, and all the land of Canaan (...) promised to him and
his seed. The land of C^naan wa^ a type of heaven: so heaven i^ p^^mised to the
seed of Christ with Christ: Christ obtained it of his Father for us by his
suffering, Heb 5.9. And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal
salvation unto all them that obey him. Heb. 8.14. For by one offering, he has
perfected for ever them that are sanctified.

All that Christ did do or suffer, was for man, he was made perfect for them:
and the children of God has the whole benefit of it: so they are made perfect
in Christ; He is the author of eternal salvation unto all them; for they are
the seed of Christ, not as they are men, but as they are Saints.

CHAP. XII. How the seed of Christ is the Church of Christ, or the Spouse of
Christ.
CHrist has purchased of his Father a chosen people to himself in his Father;
he is a common salvation to all, but a special salvation to them, and them he
will make known hi^ love and mind unto by degrees. This seed of himself in
them is the Church of Christ: and the Church of Christ is the body of Christ,
Ephesians. 1.23. Not as he was man, but (...) he is God; he i^ a Spirit, and the
Church which is his body must be spiritual too, and suitable to Christ; for he
is the head of the Church, Ephesians. 5.23. So the seed of himself being sown in
all the Saints, is the body, Ephesians. 5.23. Christ is the head of the Church, and
the Savior of the body, verse. 25, 26, 27. Christ loved the Church, and gave
himself for it, that he might sanctify and cleanse it, with the washing of
water, by the word, that be might present is to himself a glorious Church,
not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, but that it should be holy, and
wiihout blemish.

That seed of Christ in us is perfect: and Christ came not to purge,
sanctify, and wash it: but to wash us, as we are men and women, to purge away
our sins by his blood, and to sanct^fie and wash us in our conversation by
his Spirit in us. We have a near relation to Christ as he was man; for we are
members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones, Ephesians. 5.30. He took our
nature upon him, that he might obtain all things for us, as we are men: and
he is the Savior of our bodies, Ephesians. 5.23. For our body is the temple of
the holy Ghost, 1 Cor. 6.19. Know ye not that ye are the temple of God? and
that the Spirit of God dwells in you? If (...) man defile the Temple of God,
him shall God destroy. For the Temple of God is holy, which t^^ple ye are, 1
Cor. 3.16, 17. For ye are not yo^ own, ye are bought with a price, 1 Cor. 6.20.

He has redeemed us to himself, that we should serve him in all love; he
has done all things for the glory of himself, and that we should have the
benefit of it: and he does purge his Temple for himself to dwell in: but as we
are men there is no good in us, nor no inclination to good; we are but poor
earthen vessels, yet he himself is pleased to dwell in us by his Spirit. For
God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, has shined in our
hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of
Jesus Christ. But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency
of the power may be of God, and not of us, 2 Cor. 4.6, 7.

So it is not our bodies that is the Church; for our bodies are not one with
God, for it is but an earthen vessel for the Spirit of God to dwell in. But
this Spirit being in all the children of God, makes one body. Now ye are the
body of Christ, and members in particular, 1 Cor. 12.27. For as the body is
one, and has many members, and all the members of that one body being many,
are one body: so also is Christ. For by one Spirit are we all baptized into
one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bound or free, and
have been all made to drink in^^ one Spirit. For the body is not one member,
but many. If the foot shall say, because I am not the hand, I am not of the
body: is it therefore not of the body? And if the ear shall say, because I
(...) not the eye, I am not of the body: is it therefore not of the body? If
the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were he^ring,
where were the smelling? But now has God set the members every one of them in
the body, as it has pleased him. And if they were all one members, where were
the body? But now are they many members, yet but one body. And the eye ca^^^
say to the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have
no need of you. N^^ much more those members of the body which see^ to be more
feeble, are necessary. But all th^^^ works by one and the self same Spirit,
d^viding to every man severally as he will, 1 C^^ 12.11. to the 22. But unto
every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift (...)
Christ. Wherefore he says, When he ascended (...) on high, he led captivity
captive, and gave gif^ unto men. He ascended up far above all heav^^ that he
might fill all things. And he gave some ^postles, and some Evangelists, and
some Pastors (...) Teachers: For the perfecting of the Saints, for (...) work
of the Ministry, for the edifying of the bo^^ of Christ, An^ growing up into
him in all thi^^ which is the head, even Christ. From whom (...) whole body is
fitly joined together, and com^^cted, by that which every joint supplieth,
according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, makes
increase of the body unto the edifying of it self in love, Ephesians. 4.7, 8.10,
11, 12.15, 16.

Christ is the head, and his Church the body, and every particular Saint is the
members of it: and Christ which is the head, has compact, and fitly joined
this body together he being the head of it: the head is the principal of all,
for that receives sustenance for the nourishment of the body, as a tree
receives nourishment by the root; for the sap is in the root, and springs
into the body, and so infuseth into the branches, and causes them to bring
forth fruit. I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abides in me, and I
in him, the same brings forth much fruit; for without me ye can do nothing,
Joh. 15.5.

Christ in all the Saints in the Vine, and every particular Saint are the
branches: and Christ has the fullness of the Godhead which is the root of
all, and the Church is of the seed. Christ is the fullness of him that fills
all in all, Ephesians. 1.23. He is the head, from which all the body by joints and
bands having nourishment ministered and knit together, increases with the
increase of God, Col. 2.19. And he has put all things under his feet: And
gave him to be the head over all things, to the Church, which is his body,
Ephesians. 1.22, 23. So he supplieth the wants of the Saints with the infusing of
the fullness of himself into them, working effectually in them, according to
the measure that he infuseth in them in his wisdom: so though we have but the
manifestation of himself in a small measure, let us not say, I am not of the
body, because I have no more; for the body cannot be without the foot: but be^
contented with that thou have, still desiring, and waiting patiently for more:
and those that are the weakest members in this spiritual body, the Church,
has as much honor with God, as the highest members, and are as glorious.
Those members of the body which seem to be more feeble, are necessary: and
tho^^ members of the body which we think to be lest honorable, upon these we
bestow more abundant honor: and our uncomely parts have more abundant
comeliness; for our comely parts have no need: but God has tempered the body
together, having given more abundant honor to that part which lacked, that
there should be no schism in the body, but that the members should have the
same care one for another. And whether o^^ member suffer, all the members
suffer with (...) or one member be honored, all the memb^^^ rejoice with it, 1
Cor. 12.22. to the 26. And ^is Church is compared to a building, and (...)
called a spiritual building; whose builder and ^^ker is God. Ye are the Lords
building: and ye ^e built upon the foundation of the Apostles and ^rophets,
Jesus Christ himself being the chief ^^er stone. In whom all the building
fitly fra^ed together, graweth unto an holy Temple in the (...). In whom you
also are builded together for (...) hobitation of God through the Spirit, Ephesians.
2.^^, 21, 22.

The foundation of the Prophets and Apo^^es is Christ, and he is the
cornerstone. Ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house, (...)
holy Priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifice, ^^ptable to God by Jesus
Christ. Wherefore it (...) contained in the Scripture, Behold, I lay in ^^ion a
chief cornerstone, elect and precious, and (...) that believes on him shall
not be confounded, ^sa. 28.16. It is he that is the builder, and he ^uil^s his
Church upon himself; he is the ^ooke: and he faith, Upon this rock will I
build ^y Church. This is sure builded; Therefore who^^ver bears these sayings
of mine, and does them, ^ill liken him unto a wife man, that built his ^^se
upon a rock. And the rain descended, and (...) ^^oods came, and the wind
blew, and beat (...) that house, and it fell not, for it was founded ^^on a
rock, Mat. 7.24, 25. And he is the cornerstone that joins the building fast
to^^^ther, and this cornerstone holds up the b^^^ding: and in the corner two
meet together he gives the Jews and Gentiles to himself and the Spirit of
himself in us is the stone th^^ he builds withal through that word of G^^ that
was taught by the Prophets and Apost^^^ and this Church and building is the
Spous^^ Christ, a garden enclosed, is my sister, my Spouse, spring shut up, a
fountain sealed, Cant. 4.1^*

There is the nearest relation betwixt G^^^ and his Church as can be: and all
his fulne^^ of love, and all glory, and all happiness, for his Spouse: but yet
it is shut and sealed th^^ she cannot see it; yet it is shut up in her beleved
for her, and he will come quickly. It sh^^^ not be long before he will come,
and break open this seal to thee, that art the Spouse^ Christ. There is none
can do it but he, a^^ he will show thee that fullness of happiness th^^ thou
have in him, and how it was thine wh^^ thou were an enemy to him, and he has
k^^ it in store for thee, though thou knew is no^ O what sweet expressions
of love he utter^^ to her, that she might know his love: he ^al^ her, my
love, my dove, my fair one, Cant. 2.1^* Thou art all fair my Love, and there
is no sp^^ (...) thee. And, my Dove, my undefiled is bu^ (...) Cant. 6.9.

Though some be grown in some measure ^^gh Saints, and some lies low, some
have ^uch enjoyment of God, some little, and some ^one at all; yet they are all
his Love, his Dove, ^is undefiled, and fair one. They all, but only thee, is
his Spouse, he has but one love for them all; he loves them all alike with an
everlasting love, and none can keep them from him, she is his Wife? I have
married thee to my self, Hosea 2.19, 20. I will marry thee unto (...) for
ever; yea, I will marry thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and
in mercy, and in compassion. I will marry thee unto me in faithfulness, and
thou shall know the Lord.

The Lord has married us unto himself before the foundation of the world; for
he knew what should come to pass, but we do not know it; for it is shut up
in Christ, and sealed, and in his time he comes and breaks open this seal to
us by degrees, and opens himself to us, and she^s us that he is married to us;
he is our husband, Jer. 31.32. and we are his Wife. Let us be glad, and
rejoice, and give glory to him; for the matriage of the Lamb is come, and his
wife has made her self ready, Revel. 19.7.

O what comfort is this to every member of this Church that, Christ is thy
husband, and thou art his wife. My well-beloved is mine, and I am his, Cant.
2.16. There cannot be a nearer relation; for he being our husband, a^^ things
are ours in him; whether they be things present, or things to come: even all
are yours, (...) you are Christ's, and Christ is Gods, 1 Cor. 3.22, 23. And
being married to Christ, God (...) our Father, and the holy Ghost is our
Comforter, and the Angels are our guard to attend us: And what can we desire
more, but (...) have the Seal broke open to see what we ha^^ in him? and
Christ is coming to do it. (...) yet a very little while, and he that shall
come, wi^^ come, and will not tarry, Heb. 10.37. Behold, I come quickly, Revel.
3 11. And do thou wa^^ patiently for his coming.

CHAP. XIII. Christ is the Teacher and Governor of his Church.
CHrist is a King, a Priest, and a Prophet. A King to reign over his Church
spiritually: and a Priest, to offer spiritual sacrifice to his Father for his
Church: and a Prophet, to teach them. He says, My kingdom is not of this
world. John 18.36. But he is an immortal, and an everlasting King, 1 Timothy
1.17. He (...) a spiritual King, and it is a spiritual Kingdom that he
reigns over: and the children ^f God are the heirs of this Kingdom. Fear ^t
little flock, for it is your Fathers will to give (...) the Kingdom, Luke
12.32. And the kingdom of God is eternal life. Joh. 10.28. And (...) give
unto them eternal life, and they shall never ^^ish, neither shall any pluck
them out of my band. And this is a hidden, glorious, and mystical ^^ing: But
to you it is given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, Mat. 13.11.
And the ^ingdom of God comes not with observations. Nei^^er shall (...) say,
lo here, on lo there: for behold, ^he kingdom of God is with in you, Lu.
17.20, 21. ^ry not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into hea^^n? That is to
bring Christ from above. Or who ^^all descend into the deep? That is, to bring
up Christ again from the dead. But what says the Scripture? The word is near
thee, even in thy ^^uth, and in thy heart, this is the word of faith which we
preach, Romans 10.6, 7, 8. And this lord is Christ, John 1.14.

What is heaven, but the fullness of all happiness? and that is God in Christ:
and Christ ^^ing in us by his Spirit, then is the Kingdom ^f God in us: and so
far as he reveals himself to us as he is, we see him as he is, and have the
enjoyment of him: and so far we live in ^im, and have out conversation in
heaven, that is, in God. For the kingdom of God is not (...) word, but in
power, 1 Cor. 4.20. It conf^^^ not in speaking of words: but so far as he
^^veales himself in us, he comes with power, enabling us to do that which is
pleasing to hi^* and he reveals heaven to us here in some measure, by degrees
in his time, as shall be to h^^ glory and our comfort, and in a great a^^ high
measure in some: but we cannot have (...) in such a measure as we shall have
it hereaf^^^ when our bodies are dissolved; then we sh^^^ be wholly in it,
there shall be nothing to hi^der us: now here our bodies are weak, an^ cannot
contain him, and there is a veil before us that we cannot see him clearly:
an^ Christ is the Governor of the Church. Isa. ^* 6, 7. For unto us a Child
is borne, and unto (...) a Son is given, and the government is upon (...)
shoulder, and he shall call his name Wonderfull^ Counselor, the mighty God,
the everlasting Father, the Prince of peace. The increase of his government and
peace shall have no end; he shall s^^ upon the Throne of David, and upon his
Kingdom to order it, and to stablish it with judgment (...) with justice; from
henceforth, even for ever; the zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this.
H^^ is our husband, and he reigns over us in lo^ and so he governs us: and all
his laws that (...) does set forth for us to observe, is to love him, ^^d so
far as he does reveal himself to us, ^e can do no other: and he defends
us against (...) our spiritual enemies that rise up against (...), and would
devour us. And he has made (...) Kings with him, 1 Pet. 2.9. Revel. 5.10.
(...) reign with him for ever. And he is our ^^iest to offer up spiritual
sacrifice to his Fa^^er for us upon that golden Altar of himself, (...). 8.3.
And he makes intercession continu^^ly to his Father for us. 1 John 1.12. My
^^es, these things write I unto you, that ye sin (...): and if any man sin,
we have an Advocate ^^th the Father, Jesus Christ the just, and he is (...)
reconciliation for our sins: and not for ours on^^ but also for the sins of the
whole world. And ^^e has made u^ Priests with him as we are ^ints; for his
Spirit in us offers up continual ^^rifice to God by Christ, of praises and
^^anks-giving: And he is our Prophet to teach (...). We shall be all taught of
God; he will teach (...) so plainly by his Spirit, his own mind in ^^^h a
plain way, that a wayfaring man though ^oole, cannot err therein.

The Lord said, Write the vision, and make it ^^^ne upon Tables, that he may
run that reads (...), Hab. 2.2. After those days, says the Lord, (...) will
put my law in their inward parts, and write (...) their hearts, and I will be
their God, and ^^ey shall be my people. And they shall teach no more every man
his neighbor, and every man (...) brother, saying, know the Lord; for they
shall know me, from the least of them, to the greatest^ them, Jer. 31.33, 34.

The Lord will teach his children by his Spirit, in a more clearer manner than
he ha^ done: and so far as he teaches them, the shall all know him, and he
shall teach us (...) profit. 1 Cor. 2.4, 5. My speech and my preach^^ was not
with enticing words of man's wisdom, (...) in demonstration of the Spirit, and
of power. T^^ your faith, should not stand in the wisdom of (...) but in the
power of God. When the Lord d^^^ teach us by his Spirit, that comes with power
and over-powers us, and makes us willing (...) do, and be what he would have
us: so (...) power is made known in us. That whi^^ Christ teaches us to know,
is himself, Eph^ 4.21. If so be that ye have heard him, and (...) been taught
by him, as the truth is in Jesus; th^^ we may know what he is in the Saints,
and (...) the Saints. Psalm. 65.8. I will hear what God (...) Lord will speak;
for he will speak peace to his p^^ple, and to his Saints.

All that Christ does teach us, is to kno^ himself: and Paul desired to know
nothing (...) but Christ, and him crucified. 1 Cor. 2.2. An^ he speaks
nothing, but what is in him for (...) that all that is in him, he has
purchased (...) us: and he has purchased us unto himselfes and we are his
Wife, and he will always dwell with us, and be in us, and always uphold us,
and never leave us, nor forsake us.

CHAP. XIIII. God is very tender and careful over those that are but babes in
him, and leads them as they are able to go.
I Having done mine endeavor to show you the right meaning of some things in
some measure, which we are ready to stumble at: and now there will be a plain
way to walk in. Christ himself does lead us gently, as we are able to go,
teaching us by degrees: and he is very careful of those that are but babes in
him: those that the seed of himself does but newly appear in them, and that
but in a small measure, Isa. 40.10. Behold, the Lord God will come with power,
and his arm shall rule for him: Behold, his reward is with him, and his work
before him. He shall feed his flock like a Shepherd, be shall gather the
lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead those
that are with young. Christ compares his Church to a flock of sheep, Ezekiel.
34.31. And ye my flock, the flock of my pasture, are men, and I am your God,
says the Lord God. And verse. 15. He says, I will feed my flock, and I will
cause them to lie down, says the Lord God. And Christ said unto Peter; love
thou me, feed my sheep. And again he said, love thou me, feed my lambs,
John 21.15, 16.

In a sheepe-fold there is sheep and lambs, and them that are with young, and
Christ is the Shepherd over them all, and feeds them all with that good
pasture which is himself. I shall first show you how gently he leads them that
are with young; that is, those that has the seed of the spirit of Christ but
conceived in the^, and that but in a small measure, that it does not appear
whether there is any thing or no, neither by thee nor others; which is the
first degree of the growth of his seed in us, which are some desirings after
God; The Lord will feed and nourish these motions in us: The Lord will not
quench the smoking flax, Isa. 42.3. If there be any desiring after him,
though it be in the smallest measure as can be, and it lies smoking in us, and
does not burn; yet there is fire in it, or else it would not smoke. God is
called fire, Heb. 12.29. And this desiring after God, is the Spirit of God in
us; for there is nothing that can really desire after God but that which is one
with him; therefore it is a spiritual fire, and he will not quench these
motions in us, though they are but small: and though they are like sparks of
fire in us, he lays them together, and blows them with the wind of his Spirit,
and kindles this fire of himself in us, that it shall flame forth in a visible
appearance to us and others. It may lie hid a while, being covered with the
filthiness of our flesh, sin and wickedness; or with the glory of our
flesh, our righteousness: and both these are great enemies to him, and so lie
in us as if it were dead: but the Lord will quicken it, and it shall flourish:
And though Christ is but conceived in us, and these desires after him
increases more and more: so in the womb of our desires after him, he grows
more and more: and yet we do not find that this child Jesus is brought forth
in us by his Spirit, so that we can perceive it by the enjoyment of those
comforts that we expect to have in him by the manifestation of himself in us
when we are thus big with young: and this child is come to the birth, and
there wants nothing but strength to bring it forth. The Lord is then our
leader, and the Lord does comfort us in telling us by some inward motions of
his Spirit, that the manifestation of himself shall be brought forth to us in
his time, and he does up-hold us in the mean time: but we are much troubled,
while Christ is brought forth to us, that we may see him, and rejoice in him
Isa. 26.17, 18. Like as a woman with child that draws near the time of her
delivery, is in pain, and cries out in her pangs; so have we been in thy
sight, O Lord. We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it
were brought forth wind. We cannot bring forth this child Jesus in our own
strength; for all our strength is as a blast of wind: and the more we strive in
our own strength, the more pain we are in: and the nearer he is to be brought
forth to us, the more spiritual pain we have of wounds in conscience, and
troubles of mind: but when the child Jesus is brought forth in us, then we
forget that pain, for joy that Christ Jesus is brought forth to us, and all
our pain and trouble is swallowed up in the enjoyment of him: and the longer it
is before we have the enjoyment of it, the more we shall prize it when we have
it. Therefore be not discouraged, whosoever thou art, or whatsoever thou art,
that have not Christ yet brought forth in the; for this seed lies hid before it
appear: and though there is but small appearance of it in us yet, then it grows
in us, and makes way for a manifestation of himself to us. And when this
spiritual child Jesus is brought forth in us, which he calls his lambs: and
he carries them in his bosom; they are near and dear unto him. We are not
only in his bosom, but he carries us about with him: we cannot go, we are so
weak that we can neither stand nor go; one that is newborn, and therefore
we have yet no strength: We are most careful and tender of our children when
they are young ones, and feed them accordingly: and the younger they are, the
more tender we are of them, which does set forth in some measure the love of
God to those that are babes in him. Our love is imperfect, but his love to us
is perfect; he cannot forget us, we lie in his bosom, yea, in the very heart
of Christ, Cant. 8.6. Set ^ee as a seal upon thy heart, as a seal upon thy
arm. This was the request of the Spouse to Christ; she was then as a seal
upon his heart, though she saw it not: but Christ puts it in her mind to ask,
that he might make it known to her, that she was as a seal upon his heart;
that she was as near and dear to him as she can be, for she is upon his
heart and arm; the heart to love her, and his arm to defend her; he can do
no other, but love his Church, and every particular member of it, for it is one
with him, for the Spirit of Christ in us is one with Christ. He prays to his
Father, That they all may be one, as thou Father art in me, and (...) in thee;
that they also may be one in us, Joh. 17.21. That is, that we might see our
selves one in him, for then we were one in him: but we cannot know it, while
he comes and shows us it, John 17.24. Father, I will that they also whom thou
have given me, be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory which
thou have given me; for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.

His love is so great to us, that he must have us with him wheresoever he is:
so he carries us in his bosom, and upon his heart: and he is gone into
heaven, and we are there with him though we see it not: and we are glorified
with him. And the glory which thou have given me, I have given them: that they
may be one, even as we are one: I in them, and thou in me, that they may be
made perfect in one: and that the world may know that thou have sent me, and
have loved them as tho^ have loved me, John 17.22, 23.

There is not any thing that Christ think too dear or too good for us; he
bestows al^^ his excellent things upon us; he loves us (...) dearly, he cannot
keep them from us. His lov^ to us passes the love of women to their chil^dren,
yea, the greatest love that they can be^^ to them, Isa. 49.15, 16. Can a woman
forg^^^ber sucking child, that she should not have (...) passion on the son
of her womb? yea, they (...) forget, yet will I not forget thee. Behold, I ha^^
graven thee upon the palms of my hands: and thy ways are continually before me.

He would have us to take notice of his love? Behold, I have graven thee upon
the palms of my hands; he has done it, and we must behold it, and take good
notice of it; it is done already, it is not to be done by us: but God says, I
have done it: And there is not any thing in us that can hinder his love to us.
I have loved you with an everlasting love; therefore with loving kindness have
I drawn thee. These are expressions of God to us, that we are set upon his
heart, and arm, and hand, is to show us how near we are to him, and he would
have us to know it; therefore he comes himself and declares it to us by his
Spirit. Fear not, for I am with thee: be not afraid, for I am thy God, Isa.
41.10.

Man naturally is afraid of God, and it is because of our sins: and ever since
Adam fell, we have been afraid of him; some afraid of his anger, and some
afraid of punishment, Genesis 3.9, 10. And the Lord God called unto Adam, and
said unto him, where art thou? And be said, I heard thy voice in the garden:
and I was afraid, because I was naked: and I hid my self.

The righteousness of God which Adam had before his fall, did cloth him, he
saw no nakedness, he was not ashamed of the nakedness of his body, that was
nothing; he could see nothing but what was of God, and he was clothed with
him: and there was a sweet communion between God and him; he was not afraid
of God, and there was no cause of fearing any thing else; for all things below
God, were under Adam, and they had no power to do him any harm. But after Adam
fell, his falling stripped him of the righteousness of God, and so he became
naked, and then he was afraid of God: And thus by nature we are naked, and
are afraid of God: and it is our nakedness that causes our fear, and makes
us afraid of every thing below God, as well as of God: and there is not any
covering that can cover our nakedness, and so take away the cause of our fear;
for Adam did what he could to hide his nakedness, Genesis 3 7. And the eyes of
them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked: and they sewed
fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons. They saw but some part of
their nakedness: and so far as they saw it, they made a covering to hide it,
and it was of the leaves of a fig tree, fair great leaves, and that tree grew
in the Garden of Eden where Adam was put: and that was the best covering they
could get; yet they were afraid, and hid themselves from God, for all that
covering.

This Garden of Eden was a type of the church of God, which is the Spouse of
Christ, ^^^t. 4.12. and 15. and chap. 5.1. and 6.2. And this Garden, in the
midst of it, is the tree ^life, which is Christ. Rev. 2.7. To him that
^^reommeth, will I give to eat of the tree of life ^^ich is in the midst of
the Paradise of God. Joel (...) 27. And ye shall know that I am in the midst
Israel, and that I am the Lord your God, and ^e else: and my people shall never
be ashamed. ^^d he is that water of life that runs in the ^idst of the
garden, Revel. 22.1. Whosoever ^^nketh of the water that I shall give him,
shall ^^er thirst. But the water that I shall give him, ^^ll be in him a well
of water springing up into e^lasting life, John 4.14. Jesus stood, and cry^^,
saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto (...), and drink. He that
believes on me (as the ^^ipture says) out of his belly shall flow rivers of
^^ing water, John 7.37, 38. And this is that ^^e of life, that whosoever eats
thereof, they ^all live for ever. And this the Saints feed upon: but Adam did
not eat of this. And out of (...) ground made the Lord God to grow every tree
(...) is pleasant to the sight, and good for food, ^^en. 2.9.

So in the garden the Church of God, out (...) the ground of the love of God
(for he is the ^ound of all our happiness) he causes to grow every tree that
is pleasant to the e^^ and good for food, which is a comforta^^ enjoyment of
all temporal things: and goo^nesse has a promise of all things in this (...)
for temporal things, so far as it is for Go^ glory, and for our good, and for
things come, which is spiritual: but the trees of (...) ward mercies do grow
by the high way^ (...) all sorts of people to eat of as well as the ch^^dren
of God. But this is but by the way, (...) show you that we have the enjoyment
of o^^ ward things by the enjoyment of spiritual: (...) in the garden of God,
so far as Christ (...) peareth in it, it brings forth good fruits s^^ble to
him; for he is a Spirit, and the fr^^ that grow in this garden are spiritual,
and have not this fruit by nature; for except (...) are in the Vine, we cannot
bring forth fr^^ suitable to God: and we by nature are nake^ and we seeing our
selves naked, and know^ there is no appearing before God: so we ta^^ of the
broadest and fairest leaves of the show godliness that we can get, and sew
them handsomely together as we can, and co^^ that part that we see naked: but
there is a g^^ deal of our nakedness that we do not (...) and that we
cannot cover; yet God sees our nakedness, both that as we cover, and (...) as
we do not cover. When God does app^^^ (...), we are afraid of his seeing us,
for all this ^^^ing: but now Christ has clothed us ^^th his righteousness,
Mat. 6.32. And this ^^ghteousnesse is perfect: and it does exceed ^^e
righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees: ^^d that white raiment that thou
may be clo^^ed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not ^^peare, Revel.
3.18. And to her was granted, ^^t she should be arraied in fine linen, clean
and ^^ite. For the fine linen is the righteousness (...) the Saints, Rev.
19.8. And white robes were ^en to every one of them, Rv. 6.11. And being
^^athed with this robe, we have no cause to ^^e afraid; we have free access
to go to God (...) Christ; all our sins that we have commit^^d, has been
against God, and Christ has ^^tisfied his Father for them all: and therefore
^^e justifies us, and has nothing to say a^^inst us. Who shall lay any thing
to the charge (...) Gods elect? It is God that justifies. Who is he ^^at
condemns us? It is Christ that dyed, yea, ^^ther that is risen again, who is
at the right hand ^f God, who also makes intercession for us. Who ^^all
separate us from the love of Christ? shall tri^^lation, or distress, or
persecution, or nakedness, (...) famine, or peril, or sword? Nay, in all
these things we are more than Conquerours, through ^^im that loved us. For I
am persuaded, that nei^^er death, nor life nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor
powers, nor things present, nor things to com^^ Nor height, nor depth, nor any
other creature* shall be able to separate us from the love of G^^ which is in
Christ Jesus our Lord, Romans 8.33, 34* 35, 37, 38, 39.

There is not any that can separate us from God in Christ; our sins cannot do
it. I, eve^^ I am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for (...) own sake,
and will not remember thy sins, Isa. 43.25. Thou art my servant, O Israel, thou
shall (...) be forgotten of me. I have blotted out as a thic^^ cloud, thy
transgressions, and as a cloud thy sins return unto me, for I have redeemed
thee, Isa. 44.21, 22. Fear not: For I have redeemed thee, I have called thee
by thy name, thou art mine. When thou passest through the waters, I will be^
with thee; and through rive^^, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walk
through the fire, th^^ shall not be burnt: neither shall the flame kindl^ upon
thee. For I am the Lord thy God, the holy One of Israel, thy Savior: Since
thou have been^ precious in my sight, thou have been honorable, and I have
loved thee: Fear not, for I am with thee* Isa. 43.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. I will
cleanse their blood that I have not cleansed; for the Lord dwells i^ Sion,
Joel 3.21. Fear not, rejoice and be glad, for the Lord will do great things,
Joel 2.21. Behold, I will bring it health and cure: and I will cure them, and
will reveal unto them abundance (...) peace and truth, Jerem. 33.6. I have
seen his ^^es, and will heal him: I will lead him also, ^^d restore comforts
unto him, Isa. 57.18. And (...) will sow her unto me in the earth, and I will
^^e mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy, (...) I will say to them which
were not my people: (...) art my people: and they shall say, thou art my (...),
Hos. 2.23.

It is the Lord that has done all things for (...), and in his time he does
make it known to (...), that we may know his love to us, and so to ^ake us love
him: and the Devil does what ^e can to accuse God to us, and tells us God
(...) angry with us, to keep us from him; For if (...) can but persuade us to
keep from God, he ^^es not: and he thinks that is the way; for ^^e knows that
if Christ comes to reign in us ^^ce, his kingdom in us shall not stand. So
(...) does what he can to deceive us by his false ^^les; for this is the
Talebearer that does that he can to part that friend-ship that is be^^een God
and us. He is the false witness that ^eaketh lies, and him that sows discord
a^^ng brethren, Prove. 6.19. Lay not wait (O ^^ked man) against the dwelling of
the righte^^: spoil not his resting place, Prove. 24.15. God (...) that resting
place, Heb. 3.18.

There remains therefore a resting place (...) the people of God. For he that
is entered into his rest, he also has ceased from his own-wake^ Heb. 4.9, 10.
And so far as God does m^nifest himself in us, we dwell in this resti^^
place: and the Devil does what he can (...) hinder us of it by telling us
false tales: but li^^en not to him; for he is a deceiver, and a ly^^ from the
beginning. When he speaks a lie, (...) speaks of his own; for he is a
liar, and the F^ther of it, John 8.44. And if he does tell the that God is
angry, and thou must do thus a^^ thus, to pacify him through thy obedience
though he brings Scripture for what he sait^ as he did to Christ, Matthew. 4.
yet believe hi^ not. Yea, if any one deliver any other doctrine to us than that
doctrine of Christ which is the setting forth of the love of God to us, (...)
far as it is not of God, it is of the Devil^ and he is accursed. And the
Lord does co^^ with power to destroy the works of the Devil^ 1 John 3.8.

Thou art not only set upon his heart for him to love thee, but upon his arm
to defen^ thee against thy spiritual enemies, the Devi^^ and his Army, which
is sin and wickedness and our own righteousness which does pe^secute this
seed of God in us, and has do^ the uttermost of his power to destroy it quite
and this kingdom of heaven has suffered violence by the Devil: and this
seed of God i^ (...) has been kept under, and as it were impri^^d by the
Devil, and himself has reigned (...) with tyranny and cruelty; that makes
^o put up many prayers, and tears, and (...) and groans to God for him to
deliver us: (...) these prayers, sighs and groans of these ^^soners, has
entered into the ears of the ^^d, Exodus 3.7, 8. Then the Lord said, I have
^^ly seen the trouble of my people which are in Ae^^, and have heard their
cry, because of their ^^ke-masters: for I know their sorrows, There^^ I am
come down to deliver them. And our ^^ow is greater than theirs; for theirs was
a ^^poral bondage, but ours is spiritual. Behold (...) Lord God will come with
strong hand, and his (...) shall rule for him: Behold, his reward is with
(...), and his work before him, Isa. 40.10. But (...) Israel art my servant,
Jacob whom I have (...), the seed of Abraham my friend. Thou ^^m I have taken
from the ends of the earth, and ^^ed thee from the chief men thereof, and said
(...) thee, Thou art my servant, I have chosen thee, (...) not cast thee away.
Fear thou not, for I am (...) thee: be not dismayed, for I am thy God; I (...)
strengthen thee, yea, I will uphold thee with (...) right hand of my
righteousness. Behold, all (...) that were incensed against thee shall be
asha^^ and confounded; they shall be as nothing, and (...) that strive with
thee shall perish. Thou shall seek them, and shall not find them, even the^
that contended with thee; they that war agai^^ thee shall be as nothing, and
as a thing of nough^ For I the Lord thy God will hold thy right han^ saying
unto thee, Fear not, I will help thee. Fe^^ not, thou worm Jacob, and ye men
of Israel, I w^^ help thee, says the Lord, and thy Redeemer, t^^ holy One of
Israel, Isa. 41.8. to the 14. The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, therefore has
the L^^^ anointed me, he has sent me to preach good tidin^ unto the poor, to
bind up the broken hearted, (...) preach liberty to the captives: and to them
the are bound, the opening of the prison, Isa. 61.1.

The fullness of the Spirit of God is upon Christ, and he is sent to set us at
liberty: an^ it is he alone that can, and does it. It is he th^^ has broken
the head of the Serpent, and (...) is the Serpent that has bruised his heel,
which is the low and weak member of Christ: an^ it is he that does come and
break open these ^ron bars and gates of this prison that the D^vill has kept
us in withal; as the Jews la^^ hands on the Apostles, and put them in the
common prison: But the Angel of the Lord (...) night opened the prison doors,
and brought the^ forth, Acts 5.18, 19. So this prison that the Devil keeps us
in, is a common prison; for (...) keeps all mankind in this prison of
himself but there is two rooms in this prison, the on^ ^or those that are
godly: and that room of the ^rison that he keeps them most in is their own
righteousness, and that is the common pri^on for them: and the other room in
that pri^on is for all sorts of people that are not god^y. When the Jews had
put Christ to death, and when he was buried, they laid a great ^one at the
door of the Sepulcher where Christ ^as laid: and they sealed the stone lest he
should rise again, Mar. 15.46. Mat. 27.66. ^et all this could not keep Christ
from ri^^g; for there came an Angel and rolled away ^he stone, Mat. 28.2, 3, 4.
And behold, there (...) a great earthquake, for the Angel of the Lord
^^scended from heaven, and came and rolled back (...) stone from the door,
and sat upon it. And his ^^ntenance was like lightning, and his raiment (...)
white as snow. And for fear of him the keepers ^ere astonished, and became as
dead men. They ^^d what they could, after they had killed christ, to keep him
from rising again; they ^^id a great stone at the door of his Sepulcher, ^^d
sealed it to make it fast, and set men to ^atch it; yet all this could not
keep Christ ^^om rising: So the Devil does by Christ spiri^^ally now; for as
then he was crucified by his ^^ne peculiar people, not as they were Saints; ^^n
so now the Devil does stir us up as he (...) them, to persecute and
crucify Christ spiritually by the living to our righteousness; for so far
as we live to our righteousness, we embrace that, and make much of it: but if
the righteousness of Jesus Christ appears, being it is not like ours; if we
see it appear in others, we think because it is not like ours, it is false,
and we rail against it, and hate it, and do^ what we can to beat it down,
and persecute it to the death: and if it does not lie in ou^ power to do what
we would against it, we^ are very sorry that we cannot do what we would: and
we are so impudent bold, that we d^ say, that we do not hate your person, bu^
your opinions, and it is that which we hate, and do what we can to beat it
down, and thus we crucify him in others. And if he manifest himself to us
in a sweet, precious, mild^ way, speaking peace to us, we will not giv^ ear
to it, but think it is delusion, because i^ comes not like our righteousness,
so we beat^ it down: And if he makes known any thing to us of his ways, that
is contrary to our way^ to what we have been taught, and our righteousness
has led us too, we come against i^ with all the whole army of our
righteousness to stand in battle against him, not only t^ keep him out, that
is, from revealing himself and further in us, but also in killing him in u^ so
far as we see him in us: and our desire i^ that he may be wholly destroyed;
as we are ^^en, and are led by our righteousness: and ^^ing set a work by
the Devil, thus we cruci^^e Christ: and the Sepulcher that he is buri^^ in,
is our righteousness and never any was ^^ried there but Christ; for all things
of man ^^th appear, but Christ alone lies hidden: ^^d so far as we live to
our righteousness, christ lies as it were dead and buried in us, and (...) do
what we can to keep him from rising; ^^e roll the greatst stone we can get
against (...) door of this Sepulcher: we set the greatest ^^position as we
can against it, and seal it, ^^d make it sure (as we think) and set a watch
^^er it, which is our righteousness; yet all ^is cannot keep Christ from
rising: but the ^^gel will come and roll away this stone, and (...) upon it,
and make way for Christ to rise, ^^ich is some manifestation of the Spirit of
^od in us in a clear way, appearing very glo^^us, and coming with power, that
we are (...) able to resist: and he rolls away the stone (...) oppositions, and
makes a way for a clear ^^ifestation that Christ is risen in us, but he ^^h
not appear presently to us as he is risen, (...) we shall see this messenger
sit upon this ^^e of our oppositions, triumphing over (...): and the watchman,
our righteousness, (...) as if it were astonished and amazed to see the
appearance of this messenger in a glorious manner in us, which we could not
imagine of be fore we see it; it causes a great earthquake in us, and
strikes our righteousness dead: and Christ being risen, he comes with power
in us by his messenger, with some manifestations of his Spirit, to make way for
a further manifestation of himself, and his arm shall bring forth salvation
in us; he has lien as it were dead and buried in us, and his salvation has
not appeared to us: but now he will come and destroy that which has hindered
us from seeing Christ and his salvation. For his time being come to arise out
of this grave, and destroy his enemies, he will appear to us to do as Sampson
did, when he was bound with seven green cords (which is perfection of bonds)
by Delilah his wife: and he brake the cords as the thread of towe is broken
when it feels the fire. And then sh^e took new ropes, and bound him
therewith, that so the Philistines might destroy him him: but he was so strong
that they could not overcome him except he were bound: and there lay his
enemies in wait to destroy him when they saw him bound: but he brake the ropes
from his arms like a thread, Jud. 16.9. and 12. So does Christ; there is not
any thing can bind him or hinder him from rising, when his time is come. Christ
is called a fire, ^ev. 1.14. Heb. 12.29. It is the nature of fire to burn and
consume all things that are not one with it: so does Christ, to burn up that
which hinders us from seeing him, and keeps us from that sweet enjoyment
of him, which (...) our sins, and our righteousness: so he comes with flames
of fire to render vengeance on that (...) us, which knows not, but is an
enemy to God, and kept us from God: but now Christ ^ill destroy these
spiritual enemies; he will wallow them up in the victory of himself, and ^urn
up the dross in us that keeps us from see^^g that pure gold: so far as he
does manifest ^imselfe in us, he discovers which is dross and which is gold;
for in thy light we see light* ^or we cannot discern of our selves, which is
^old, which is the righteousness of Christ, and which is dross, which is our
righteous^^sse: but so far as Christ does discover this ^^osse to us, he
burns it up. Christ is the foun^ation whereon this spiritual building is built,
^^d all the building must be one and the same ^ith the foundation. Now if any
man build upon ^is foundation, gold, silver, precious siones, wood, ^^y,
stubble: Every man's works shall be made ma^ifest; for the day shall declare it,
because it shall be ^^ealed by fire, and the fire shall try every man's ^^rke
of what sort it is. If any man's works a^^de which he has built thereupon, he
shall receive a reward. If any man's works shall be burnt, be^ shall suffer
loss, but he himself shall be saved, ye^ so as by fire, 1 Cor 3.11, 12, 13,
14, 15.

When the day does appear, then it begin^ to be light, and that light makes
manifest al^ things, and this is Christ: and he being lik^ fire, he tries all
the works of man; yea thos^ works that are most excellent, that appear^ as
glorious as gold and silver and precious stone^ they must be tried: and all
that is not purel^ of Jesus Christ, and wrought by his Spirit shall be burnt up
by him, as well as hay an^ stubble, which is sin and wickedness, Psal^ 50.3.
Our God shall come, and shall not keep s^lence; a fire shall devour before
him, and it sha^ be very tempestuous round about him. That the^ our enemies
shall not be able to stand again^ him: but he will destroy them by his coming
so far as he reveals himself in us; for the^ his enemies in us are now
risen up against hi^^ to destroy him, Isa. 9.5. For every battle of t^^
Warrior is with confused noise, and garments ro^^led in blood: but this shall
be with burning an^ fuel of fire.

All the battles that the Devil comes again^ Christ withal to overcome him,
is with confusion, confuting, and contradicting him that if we were but able
to discern and ta^^ notice of his weapons that he comes to destr^^^ Christ
withal, would destroy himself: but ^ll the Devils weapons are broken in
pieces, and is fuel for this fire, which is Christ, and ^e will burn them up
by degrees, as he reveals ^imselfe in us: and thus he will destroy our
^pirituall enemies for us, Mica 7.8, 9, Rejoice ^^t against me, O mine enemy,
When I fall I shall rise, when I sit in darkness, the Lord shall be a ^ight
unto me. I will bear the indignation of the lord, because I have sinned
against him, until he ^^ead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he ^ill
bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold ^^is righteousness. Then she
that is mine enemy shall see it, and shame shall cover her which said unto me,
Where is the Lord thy God? mine eyes shall behold her, now shall she be trodden
down as the mire of the streets.

The Church of God is called a woman, Rev. 12.1. and Antichrist is called a
wom^n, Revel. 17.3. And when the Lord brings us forth to the light, then we
shall see his righteousness; then our adversary Antichrist in the history,
and that is she that does outwardly oppose Christ: and in the mystery, which
is our righteousness, Christ will tread her under his foot. Thus his arm
shall save us from our enemies, and destroy them; for he is very tender over us
that are his Spouse and beloved one: And although we are a great while
oppressed with the Devil, yet at the last Christ will come and make known to
us how he has overcome him for us, Isa. 27.1, 2, 3. In that day the Lord with
his sore and great and strong sword, shall punish Leviathan the piercing
Serpent, even Leviathan that crooked Serpent, and he shall slay the dragon that
is in the Sea. In that day sing ye unto her; A vineyard of red wine. I the Lord
do keep it: I will water it every moment: lest any hurt it, I will keep it
night and day. Which vineyard is the Church of God, and he keeps it as well in
the night; that is, in our dark condition, Hosea. 11.3. I taught Ephraim also
to go, taking them by the arms, but they knew not that I healed them: And I
have led them, but they knew it not. And so he keeps it in that dark condition
as well as in the day, when he manifests himself to us: so he will open our
eyes as we are Saints, that we shall see the things that belongs to our peace.
Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, Isa. 35.5. And the eyes of the
blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of darkness, Isa. 29.18.

So far as he reveals himself to us we shall clearly see him: and what he is
to us, when he opens our eyes: and we shall also hear him speak peace to us;
For the deaf ears shall be unstopped, Isa. 35.5. And in that day shall the
deaf hear the words of that book, Isa. 29.18. This ^ooke is that which is
spoken of in Revel. 5. and I saw in the right band of him that sat on the
^hrone a book written within, and on the backe^^de, sealed with seven seals.
And I saw a strong Angel proclaiming with a loud voice; Who is wor^^y to open
the book, and to loose the seals thereof. And no man in heaven nor earth,
neither under the ^arth was able to open the book, neither to look ^hereon.

Then the lion of the Tribe of Judah, which ^as a Lamb that had been slain; he
was found ^orthy to open the book, and to break o^en the seals. And he came
and took the book ^^t of the right hand of him that sat upon the Throne.

This book is the mind of God: as in a book a man may write his mind at
large, being of a great volume: so for our weak capacity, the mind of God is
as it were writ in a book, being written within, but on the backside sealed
with seven seals, that we cannot what is written in it. The vision is become
unto you as the words of a book that is sealed up, which they deliver to one
that cannot read, saying, Read this, I pray thee; and he says, I ^^nnot, for
it is sealed. And the book is given to him that cannot read, saying, Read
this I pray thee; and he shall say, I cannot read, Isa. 29.11, 12. And the same
book was sent to Ezekiel, Ezekiel. 2.9, 10. Behold, a hand was sent to me, and
lo a roll of a book was therein. And he spread i^ before me, and there was
written therein, lamentations, mourning, and woe. Isa. 8.16. Bind up the
testimony, seal up the law among my Disciples.

A testimony is, when a man dies, he writes down to whom he would have his
estate disposed, when and how: so in this book o^ God, is written the whole
mind of God, what he has given us, and when it shall be revealed to us: and
how yet it is bound up and sealed: and none is found worthy to open the book,
and loose the seal. He that sat upon the Throne is God the Father, and the
book that was in his hand, was the whole love and mind of God to all mankind
in Christ Jesus. And the seven seals does set forth to us, that the whole mind
and love of God is alone known to himself, and quite shut up, and as it were
sealed fast from us; that as we are men and women, we cannot know any thing
that is written therein. In this book there is written all things what Christ
has done for all, and what for his Church in particular; what he has obtained
for us, and what we are in him; what he has made us to the Father in him,
and what he is in us: And it is Christ alone that has obtained of his Father
^o open this book, and to loose the seals; for ^e was the Lamb that was
slain for all: and ^y his death he has obtained power of his ^ather to open
the book, and make known ^o us his whole mind. There are seven seals ^o be
broke open, and he does not break o^en all the seals at once, but by
degrees: and as he breaks open a seal, he says, Come and ^^e, Rev. 6.1. That
is, we must see our selves in Christ, before we can see any thing of the mind
of God made known to us: and he it is that does make known to us that we are
in him: and the first seal that he breaks open to us, are some manifestations
of his love to us: and by degrees he breaks open the seals to us, he does
make known his love and mind to us more and more, in a more fuller, clearer,
and glorious manner; every seal breaking open, are new manifestations; every
seal more glorious, clearer and fuller than the other that was broke open
before. And in this book is written lamentation, mourning, and woe to
Antichrist, for her destruction and ruin is come more and more. As Christ
breaks open the seals and reveals himself to us, he gives us that hearing
ear, his Spirit, that we may hear those things which he has unsealed to us.
The Lord God has opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned
away back. He wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned, Isa. 50.4, 5. Thou
that dwell in the gardens, the companions hearken to thy voice, cause me to
hear it, Cant. 8.13. And when we come to hear the love of God to us, then we
shall see this messenger of the Spirit of God casting the stumbling blocks out
of the way, and making known to us in some measure the great love of the Lord
to us, and so making way for a further manifestation of himself to us in a
fuller, higher, and more glorious manner; for as the seals are broke open, so
is Anti christ more and more discovered, and destroyed, by the bright coming
of Jesus Christ; for there is a sevenfold purifying of this seed of God in
us, from the seed of the Devil, before it can appear to us in the purity of
it: and that is as the seals are broke open to us, and he appears very
glorious at the breaking open of any of the seals; much more glorious will he
appear to us, when all the seals are broke open, when we shall perfectly,
fully and clearly see and know Christ as he is to us; for when they are all
broke open, then there the perfection of Christ is made known to us, for seven
is perfection.

CHAP. XV. How the LORD leads his people by faith.
THe Lord does show his people that which yet they have not the enjoyment of,
and (...) is in a high and glorious manner: and they ^^e not able to express
what it is: but by faith (...) some measure they see what it is that they ^^all
enjoy: and in the mean while they walk (...) faith, and not by fight, Heb.
11.1. Now faith (...) the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of ^^ings
not seen. And so by faith we must wait ^atiently for a further manifestation
of himself ^n us, in a more glorious and clearer manner. ^or if we hope for
that we see not; then do we with ^^tience wait for it, Romans 8.15. We must not
^e like Thomas, believe no more than we see, or ^njoy? but Christ said, Blessed
are they that ^ive not seen, and yet believe, John 20.29. A^raham desired to
see my day, and he saw it, and ^as glad. He saw by faith the glorious days of
Christ; the mysteries of the kingdom of God ^ath been hidden from us: but now
he will ^ake them manifest to his Saints, to whom God would make known what
is the riches of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you the
hope of glory, Col. 1.26, 27.

Christ manifested in the flesh is a great mystery; his first coming was in
flesh, visible to all, that all might see him. Then he went away as concerning
his flesh, and came in Spirit to us. I will not leave you comfortless, but I
will come unto you, John 14.18. And he says, I send my Spirit unto you, John
16.7. If any man love me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him:
and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him, John 14.23. So Christ
will not only come unto us, but he is in us already, and he will make it
manifest that he is come in our flesh by his Spirit; for he and his Spirit are
all one: and where Christ is, there is the Father. Know ye not that the Father
is in the Son, and the Son in the Father. And at that time ye shall know
that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you, John 14.20. For Christ is
the head, and is one with the Father, and the whole Church of God is the body,
which is the Spirit of God in all the Saints: and he is always in us, and with
us. Christ in us the hope of glory; we by faith see Christ in us, and know that
he is the glory, and wait patiently upon him while he is pleased to manifest
his glory in us: So by faith we believe, and hope for that which we have not
yet the enjoyment ^f. Though we have Christ, who is the ful^^sse of all
happiness; yet we do not see him (...) us, till he is pleased to manifest
himself to (...), and show us his glory. And this faith of ^elieving what we
shall enjoy, is a very glori^us condition, and we have abundance of joy ^^d
comfort in it; for the promise to us of the ^^joyment of himself, is sealed to
us, we are ^re of it; there is not any thing that can hin^^r him from
manifesting himself to us, Ephesians. ^.13, 14. After that ye heard the word of
truth, ^^e Gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye
were sealed with that holy Spirit (...) promise, Which is the earnest of our
inheritance, ^^till the redemption of the purchased possession, ^^to the praise
of his glory.

So the Lord revealing to us by his Spirit, ^^at there is an inheritance
purchased by christ for us, which is himself; that is the ^^eatest inheritance
that can be: and this Spi^^^ does seal it to us, till the time is come, that
^^mselfe will give us possession of that inheri^^nce that he has redeemed and
purchased ^^r us for the praise of his glory. So while we ^ave but an earnest
given us of this inheritance, ^eing we know it is sure, we are exceedingly
^omforted, and carried above all slavish fears and troubles, and above all
things that we see below Christ: and many the Lord leads a great while by
faith before he gives them a full possession of himself.

CHAP. XVI. Not for any to despise, nor undervalue, nor persecute one another.
IT is a very dangerous thing to embrace and close with that we hear, before
we know whether it be truth or no; for it is not sufficient for us to believe
a thing to be truth, because another says it is truth. For us to build upon
this is a sandy-foundation, and we cannot build sure upon it; though the things
that we hear be truth, yet except we know them to be truth, by the Spirits
teaching us, or witnessing to us by sufficient grounds set forth in the
Scripture, that those things are truth that we hear; it is very dangerous to
build upon it, and it is impossible but this building will fall; for this
foundation will not, nor cannot hold it up: and if it come to the trial, it
will fall, to the great dishonor of God, and the scandalling of Religion: and
it is as dangerous to despise, hate, or persecute any thing that we hear,
though it does not seem to us to be truth; for says Paul. After that way that
ye call heresy, so ^orship I the God of my Fathers. Though it ap^eareth to you
to be heresy, yet it may be re^^ll truth; therefore do not hate it, nor
perse^ute it; for Paul thought before his conversion that it was heresy, and
persecuted it, Acts 9.^2. And Saul yet breathing out threatenings and ^aughter
against the Disciples of the Lord, went ^^to the high Priest, and desired of
him letters to ^amascus to the Synagogue; that if he found any (...) this way,
whether they were men or women, he ^ight bring them bound unto Jerusalem. And
^he journeyed, he came near to Damascus: and ^^ddenly there shined round about
him a light from ^^aven, and he fell to the earth, and heard a voice, ^^ying
unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou (...)? And he said, who art thou,
Lord? And the lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: it is ^^^d for thee
to kick against the pricks, verse. 3, 4, ^. Paul was then one that was very
strict in all (...) ways, and walked very blameless as con^^rning the
performing of the Law: and he ^ought that all that was not as he was, were
^^retickes, and he persecuted them to the ^ath: but the Lord said unto him,
Why perse^^test thou me? I am Jesus whom thou persecutest. (...) He persecuted
Christ in his members. Inas^^eth as you have done it unto one of the least of
^^se my brethren, ye have done it to me, Mat. 25.40. Take heed how you
persecute any, though you think they are heretics, and therefore persecute
them as Paul did: and indeed there was never any persecution, but it went under
the name of punishing Heretics, and do i^ by a show of godliness, as Paul
did: but it i^ hard for you to kick against pricks; for it i^ God that ye
kick against, and he is stronger than you, and will overcome you at the last
and he is like pricks, it will pierce your selves for not any weapon that is
forged against hi^ Saints shall prosper: but shall return backe^ and destroy
their enemies; like as those me^ were that took up Shadrach, Mesbech, and
Abednego, and cast them into the fiery fornan at the Kings command, because
they would not worship their false gods. They made the furnace exceeding hot,
because it should destroy the three men that were cast into it: b^^ the flame
of the fire slew those men that ca^ them in: and Shadrach, Mesbech, and Abedego
walked in the midst of the fire, and neith^^ they nor their clothes were
burned, nor (...) much as smell of fire, Dan. 3.

Therefore whosoever thou art that pers^cutest any, take heed what thou do;
for the last God will destroy thee whosoever the art, except thou come to be
converted and they whom thou do persecute shall be (...) livered out of thy
hands, if it be to the glory (...) God, and their good: but if God has gi^^n
you so much power as to put them to ^^ath, the greatest harm that you can do
them (...) but to bring them to their full happiness: ^^d that harm that you
think to do against ^^^m, you do against your selves; for while (...)
persecute them, they are at peace and qui^^, and have abundance of the
enjoyment of ^^od, and enabled to bear exceedingly what^^ever is laid upon
them; for whatsoever is ^^nting outwardly, the Lord supplieth in^^rdly by his
Spirit, and he conveyeth him^^^fe to them in that way, that all the enemies
(...) the world, nor all the Devils in hell, are (...) able to hinder them from
the enjoyment him: but while you persecute them, you ^^^not be quiet in your
mind, but are troubled ^^^d cannot have peace, like Saul, that perse^^^^d
David. The Spirit of the Lord departed (...) Saul, and an evil Spirit from the
Lord trou^^^d him, 1 Samuel 16.14. And this Spirit cau^^ him to persecute David:
and wheresoever (...) Spirit is, it causes persecutions; for it is (...)
Ishmael that persecuted Isaac.

Object. But ought we not to punish open ^^etiques and blasphemers? for if we
do (...) punish them, they may seduce abundance people, and bring them into
their blaspe^us ways.

Answ. All the way that ought to be used, is the preaching of the Word, which
is the sword of God. For the word of God is quick and powerful, and sharper
than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and
spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is (...) discerner of the thoughts
and intents of the heart Heb. 4.12. And in Revel. 1.16. speaking there of
Christ, it says, Out of his mouth wen^ a sharp two-edged sword (which is the
Gospel. And it is the power of God to salvation, Romans 1^.16. And I saw another
Angel fly in the midde^ of heaven, having the everlasting Gospel to preac^ to
them that dwell on the Earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and
people, Sayin^ with a loud voice, fear God, and give glory to him for the hour
of his judgment is come: and worshi^ him that made heaven and earth, and the
Sea, an^ the fountains of waters. And there followed another Angel, saying,
Babylon is fallen, is faller that great City, because she made all Nation
drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. Rev. 14.6, 7, 8.

Ye may see how powerful the preaching (...) the Gospel is to the destroying
of errors. Th^^ is the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word God, Ephesians.
6.17. which is powerful to the be^ting down of all strong holds of Satan. And
it sharper than any two-edged sword, and will destroy this great City
Antichrist, and (...) it down to the ground; for this will ^nt ^^nder all the
joints whereby it is joined to^^ther, and the very soul, and spirit, and
^^arrow of it, whereby it does live, even the ^^y life of it shall be destroyed
by the prea^ing of the Gospel; for this does find out the ^^undation of the
building of Antichrist, and ^^ll it down, and the building will fall of it
^^fe: and we are commanded to use this way, ^^d the Apostles did use this way,
and no o^^er, and they found it very beneficial; for by they were brought out
of their errors: and ^^re was daily abundance added to the ^^urch such as
should be saved. False doctrine ^^th not so much power to build up errors,
(...) the Gospel of Jesus Christ has power to ^^roy them, if it be rightly
preached: and if (...) go any other way to work in beating ^^ne errors, it
will not do it, though you ^^^secute them to the death, it will make it ^^ead
the more, and make them that you per^^^te the more zealous for it.

I beseech you beloved take heed of these two ^^^gs of closing to all that we
hear, and buil^^^g upon it before God makes it truth to us ^his Spirit, and of
hating and persecuting (...) which is not truth to you; for it may be ^^^th,
though God has not made it known to you, therefore hate it not, nor persecut^
it, lest you are found to persecute God. Judg^ not before the time, but leave
all to God; for to him we stand or fall, for that which is no^ of God shall
fall at the last. But whatsoev^^ you hear, desire the Lord to teach you by h^^
Spirit, whether it be truth or no, and wai^^ upon God, using the means as
hearing a^^ reading, and the like: but not depend upon (...) but see God above
it, while he does please reveal himself to you, and show you what truth: and
whenever he does any time ma^^ known any thing to you to be truth by
su^^^cient grounds according to the word, thou^^^ it be never so sudaine; that
embrace, and ^^tertaine, and rejoice at any manifestation the love of God to
you. Despise not the day small things? and though you see others so^^ higher in
the enjoyments of God, and in (...) ways of God, than you, yet be not troub^^
at it, nor do not envy their condition, (...) he is the same to you as he is
to them, thou^^ you see it not; for the Lord says, he will fa^^ Christ as a
nail in a sure place, and he shall be a glorious throne to his fathers house.
And shall hang upon him all the glory of his fathers h^^ the offspring and the
issue, all vessels of ^^quantity: from the vessels of cups, even to all
vessels of flagons, Isa. 22.23, 24. They all (...) upon Christ, even the small
cups, which are ^e lowest Saints, as well as the flagons, which ^e high. On all
the vessels in the house of the lord, is a glorious one, for it is Christ that
^akes them so: and be not troubled, because ^ou see many several opinions in
the world, ^or God is not limited to any one of them; ^^r God has, and will
reveal his whole mind ^o his Church: but every particular one knows ^ut in
part, and opinions are but the shells: ^t us not strive for them; for we cannot
live upon them; if we have the kirnell it is suffici^^t, which is Christ, for
he is the substance, and all things else are but shells to him: and let (...) be
willing for him to lead us by his Spirit, and he will lead us in the right way:
and they that are grown high Saints, and have abun^ance of enjoyment, let them
not despise nor ^^dervalue those that are low. There is all ^anner of growth of
Saints among us: and I ^peak to al sorts of you, do not u^dervalue those that
are not as you are, for we are all brethren (...) Christ, and so we are to
esteem one another, if there by any appearance of godliness; ^^^r my dove my
undefiled is but one, Cant. 6.9.

Give no just occasion to any to scandal re^igion; become low to those that
are low, yet speaking the truth: but in such a way as they may plainly
understand; you do not speak of high mystical things to those that are very
low, except ye speak them forth in a very clear manner; for being they cannot
understand it, they conclude it is heresy: so by it religion comes to be
scandalized: but this meat is too strong for babes, they must be fed with
milk as Paul did, 1 Cor. 3.2. I have fed you with milk, and not with meat;
for hitherto ye were not able to bear it. Heb. 5.13, 14. For every one that
uses milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe. But
strong meat belongs to them that are of full age, even those who by reason
of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.. So by
degrees feed them as they are able to bear it, and do not dishearten any,
though they are never so low; for consider that once ye were low your selves,
therefore bear with their weakness and infirmities. And beloved, let not us
make a rent or schism in this body, the Church of Christ; let not the
Presbytery despise those that they call Independents; nor the Independents
despise the Presbytery: and those that are neither of them, let them not
despise either of them; for those that are the children of God, what form
soever they are in, there is the seed of God in them, though it be covered with
a great deal of dross, that the seed of God does little appear; yet that which
is of God is pure wheresoever it is, though Antichrist appears more in them
than Christ, and seduceth them, and ^hey cannot see it, while Christ does break
o^en his seals to us: and as he breaks open a ^^al to us, then we come to
see more light, then ^e see what gross ways of Antichrist we have ^een in;
then we come out of that form into another, that more seeming glorious form
^han the other that we were in before: but An^i-christ will reign in us in this
form as well as in the other that we were in, appearing more glorious to us
then he did before: and when the Lord comes and breaks open another seal to
us, and brings us up higher to himself, and ^hews us more light than we saw
before; then we see what a dark way we were in before; then we come out of
that form into another form more glorious than the other, even the most
purest and glorious form that we can find in all the Scripture.

Thus the Lord brings us from one thing to another; from Papacy to Presbytery,
from Presbytery to Independency, and the Lord is in every one of these forms
to his people while he brings them out of it: and Satan also does transform
himself to an Angel of light, and will be in that form to you; for now you are
out of an Antichristian way, and think your selves safe: but you may hug and
embrace Antichrist in the mystery, when you hate him, and speak against him in
the history: and the more glorious form you are in, the more secure you think
your selves; and are ready to say, let us here build Tabernacles. And beloved,
we make goodly Images to our selves; the more glorious our form is, the more
glorious images we make: and the more liker God, the more dangerous; for that
which is not purely of God, so far as it is not of God, it is of Antichrist,
and we make an image of it, and that which is like Christ; for Antichrist does
appear in us like Christ, we do not know him from Christ; therefore let not
any of us despise each other, or undervalue one another, for Antichrist does
tyrannize over us all, some in one way, and some in another, and he it is that
causes us to despise and undervalue one another; for that which is of God is
loving and kind to all, and meek and mild, and causes us to forgive one
another, and forbear one another, and overcome one another with love. When
Christ comes and breaks open another seal to you, then you will see that yet
you are in the dark; for that light which now you have, is a great light to
that which you saw before: but it is but darkness to that light which shall
appear to you: and then he will show you that a great deal of that in you
which you thought was spirit, will appear to be but flesh, which is of
Antichrist.

CHAP. XVII. How God brings his Church into the wilderness.
THere is a spiritual wilderness that Christ brings his Saints into, before
he gives them a full possession of Canaan, that is, that glorious
inheritance, which is Christ. A wilderness is a barren place; he will strippe
us of all our excellent things, so far as it is not purely of himself; he
will come with the Northwinde, and nip, and deaden, and blast all our most
excellent performances, that we shall have nothing to trust to, but see our
selves in a barren condition like a wilderness. The church of God has been in
the wilderness ever since Antichrist began to reign: and Antichrist is that
which is like Christ, yet opposes Christ, and it began in the Apostles days;
for no sooner is there any thing of Christ made known, but the Devil will
transform himself as like it as may be, and labor to set up his way in us,
and opposes the way of Jesus Christ. For every spirit that confesses not that
Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is not of God: and this is that spirit of
Antichrist whereof you have heard, that it should come, and even now already
it is in the world, 1 John 4.3. Little children it is the last time: and as ye
have heard that Antichrist shall come; even now there are many Antichrists,
whereby we know that it is the last times, 1 John 2.18. That which does deny
Christ any other ways in the history, or in the mystery, in what manner soever
it be, so far as we hold any thing that is not the pure truth of Christ, so
far as it is not truth it is of Antichrist, though it appear never so
glorious: and it is said that there are many Antichrists, because he
appears in many ways to us: but he did not reign in the Apostles time so as
he has done since; for the Gospel was then purely preached: but Christ told
his Disciples what things should come to pass, Mat. 24.15. When ye therefore
shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel the Prophet, stand
in the holy place? whosoever reads, let him understand.

When the Lord opens our eyes, that we see it before us, and in us, then we
come to read and understand, that the abomination of Antichrist being set up,
makes the truth of Jesus Christ desolate; for that light that shined in the
Apostles days has been quite put out, and the Church has been led in a very
dark way; for the mind of God has been sealed up with seven seals: and all
the time that the book is sealed up, the Church is in the wilderness, and
there she has a place prepared of God, and there she should be fed a
thousand, two hundred and threescore days, Rev. 1.26. And this was the time of
the two Witnesses prophesying. And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and
they shall prophecy a thousand, two hundred, and threescore days clothed in
sackcloth, Rev. 11.3.

God has some always to speak forth his pure truth in some measure: and they
that speak forth the things of Christ, are the witnesses of Christ, and they
prophecy in sacke-cloath; which sign of sorrow and mourning when there is but
little manifestation of Jesus Christ, then we are kept under by Antichrist,
both outward and inward, and then is the time of mourning. Can the children of
the bridechamber fast while the Bridegroom is with them? but when the
Bridegroom is taken from them, in those days shall they fast. And when they
fasted, they used to be clothed in sackcloth, which does appear that the
time of the Church being in the wilderness, having then but small appearance
of the Bridegroom to them, then is the time of fasting and mourning, yet God
does feed and preserve her from all those devouring beasts that are in the
wilderness: and there are seven degrees of coming out of this wilderness,
and the Lord does first show us that we are in the wilderness, before he does
make it known to us that he has brought us out of it; he will show us our
barrenness by stripping us quite naked of all our goodly things, that we shall
have nothing to trust too, then will he reveal himself in us, and appear to
be all in all in us, and then he will appear very glorious, Hosea. 2.14. I
will bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her. There is
first a dying to the flesh, before there is appearing to live in the Spirit;
for while our first husband, (the law or flesh) is alive, we live unto him: but
if he be dead by the life of Christ appearing in us, then we are free to marry
to another, which is to Christ, Romans 7.4. Ye are dead, and your life is hid
with Christ in God, Col. 3.3. We are dead to the flesh by the power of the
death of Christ; for Christ dyed for the destruction, I do not mean our
bodies, but that which is of Antichrist in us: and our life is hid with Christ
in God; for our life is in the life of Christ. I live, yet not I, but Christ
lives in me: and the life that I now live in the flesh (which is in the body)
I live by the faith of the Son of God, Gal. 2.20. But in the beginning of
this verse, he says, I am crucified with Christ, Gal. 6.14. God forbid that I
should glory in any thing save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom
the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world. So we are crucified to
all things that is below Christ, 2 Cor. 5.16, 17. Wherefore henceforth know we
no man after the flesh; yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet
^ow henceforth know we him so no more. Therefore if any man be in Christ he
is a new creature; ^lde things are passed away, behold all things are become
new.

We must not know Christ any longer after our fleshly apprehension; for all our
old imaginations of Christ must pass away by the new manifestations of Christ
in us, Romans 8.10, 11. And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of
sin: but the Spirit is life, because of righteousness. But if the Spirit of
him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you: he that raised up Christ
from the dead, shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that
dwells in you.

Here is a dying to the flesh, and then living to thee Spirit; It is aPpointed
for man once to dye. And after death, comes the judgment, as all things is,
and shall be fulfilled outwardly in the history; so all things shall be
fulfilled spiritually in us in the mystery. Christ is risen in us, and is come
to spiritual judgment, and does raise up his Spirit in us, that has lain as
it were dead in us: and the flesh (which is Antichrist) shall stand before God,
and be judged and condemned by him, Col. 3.4. When Christ who is our life shall
appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory: and we shall be like
him, for we shall see him as he is, 1 John 3.2. Blessed and holy is he that
has part in the first resurrection, on such the second death has no power,
Revel. 20.6.

This is the first resurrection, and the Lord is set in his judgement-seate to
destroy Antichrist. And then shall that wicked one be revealed, whom the Lord
shall consume with the Spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the
brightness of his coming: Even him whose coming is after the working of
Satan, with all power, and signs, and lying wonders, 2 These. 2.8, 9.

Satan is said to sit in heavenly places, because he transformeth himself to
the likeness of God, and so deceives us, making us believe he is God, and so
we worship him, thinking he is God. How art thou fallen from heaven, O
Lucifer, Son of the Morning? how art thou cut down to the ground, which did
weaken the Nations? For thou have said in thy heart, I will ascend into heaven,
I will exalt my Throne above the Stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount
of the Congregation in the sides of the North. I will ascend above the height
of the clouds, I will be like the most High. Yet thou shall be brought down to
hell so the sides of the pit. They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee,
and consider thee, saying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that
did shake Kingdoms? That made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the
Cities thereof, that opened not the ^house of his prisoners? Hell from beneath
is moved for thee, to meet thee at thy coming: thy pomp is brought down to
the grave, and the noise of thy viols. The worms are spread under thee, and
the worms cover thee, Isa. 14.9. to the 17. And there came one of the seven
Angels which had the seven Vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come
hither, I will show thee the judgment of the great Whore that sit^eth upon many
waters: With whom the Kings of the Earth have committed fornication, and the
Inhabiters of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.
So he carried me away in the Spirit into the Wilderness, and I saw a woman
sit upon a scarlet-colored beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven
heads and ten bornes. And the woman was arraied in purple, and ^earlet, and
decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls, having a golden cup in her
handful of abominations, and filthiness of her fornication. And I saw the
woman drunk with the blood of the Saints, and with the blood of the Martyrs of
Jesus, Revel. 17. All nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her
fornication, Rev. 18.3. Here is a discovering of Antichrist before she is
judged, condemned, and destroyed: and when the time is come for the discovering
of her to us, then he shows us her by a high and glorious revelation of
himself; for there is not any thing that can discover Antichrist to us, but
the Spirit of God.

When the Lord does come to show us any thing of himself in the mystery, he
says, come up hither, and I will show you the things that must be hereafter:
and immediately I was in the Spirit, Rev. 4.1. Rev. 1.10. Rev. 17.1. Rev. 21.9.
There is no seeing of any thing of God in the truth of it, but by the
revelation of the Spirit of God, and he carries us as we are Saints up into
himself: and the higher he carries us, the more he shows us of the mystery
of himself; for as he opens the seals in making known any thing of
himself to us, he says, Come up hither, Rev. 4.12. After this I looked, and
behold, a door was open in heaven: and the first voice which I heard, was as
it were of a trumpet talking with me, which said, Come up hither, and I will
show thee things that must be hereafter. And immediately I was in the Spirit,
and behold, a Throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the Throne. And being
in the Spirit he comes to see it; then after he has shown himself to us, he
shows us Antichrist, which is called the great Whore, because we all commit
spiritual fornication with her: and here is a carrying us up higher in the
Spirit to see her. And there came one of the seven Angels which had the seven
Vials, and talked with me, and saying unto me, Come hither, I will tell thee
the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carries her: and I will show
unto thee the judgment of the great Whore, Rev. 17.17. And then after he has
showed us the mystery of the Whore, and her destruction, then he shows us the
marriage of the Church to Christ in the mystery, and in his glory. And there
came unto me one of the seven Angels, which had the seven vials full of the
seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will show thee
the Bride, the Lambs wise. And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and
high mountain, and showed me that great City, the holy Jerusalem, descending
out of heaven from God, having the glory of God, Rev. 21.9, 10, 11.

So we are carried up higher and hiher into God by the Spirit of God, revealing
the things of God in us: and when the Spirit of God does show us God sitting
upon his Throne in his glory, in such a measure as we are enabled to see him;
then he shows us Antichrist in his glory, or the Whore in her glory; for it
is one and the same, as Christ and his Church is, Christ being the head, and
his Church the body: so Antichrist, which is the Devil, transformed to an
Angel of light, is the head, 2 Cor 11.14. and his seed in us all is the body,
which is called the Whore, and she does appear very glorious. And the woman
was arraied in purple, and scarlet-colour, and decked with gold, and precious
stones, and pearls, Rev. 17.4. like the church of God, the Lambs wife: and
without the Spirit of God does show us the difference betwixt her and the
Church of God, we do not know her from the Church of God, for she is in the
wilderness where the Church of God is, Rev. 17.3. So he carried me in the
Spirit into the wilderness, and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet-colored
beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads, and ten horns. By
seeing the beast that she sits upon, which does bear her up, and this beast
does ascend out of the bottomless pit, Revel. 11.7. We come to know her from
the Church of God. And there appeared a great wouder in heaven, a woman
clothed with the Sun, and the Moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown
of twelve Stars. And she being with child, crying, traveling in birth, and
pained to be delived.

This woman is the Church of God, and is said lo be in heaven, that is, in
Christ; for he is the perfect heaven: and she is clothed with Christ, which
is the Son of righteousness, and all things that are below him, is under her
feet. And she has a crown of twelve stars, the glory of Christ, that did
appear by that Doctrine that was taught by the twelve Apostles of Christ; for
the Preachers of the Gospel are called stars, Rev. 1.20. She has the glory of
Christ, and is cloached with him, and he is with her, and in her, yet she saw
it not; he had not manifested himself to her. She was as it were with child
with him, and in great pain, desiring to have him brought forth to her, that
she mighe see him as he is, and have the enjoyment of him: and no sooner did
this woman appear, but there appeared another wonder in heaven. And behold, a
great red Dragon, having seven heads, and ten bornes, and seven crowns upon
his head, and he stood before the Woman which was ready to be delivered, for
to devour her child as soon as it was delivered.

Thus Antichrist labors to devour Christ as soon as he is brought forth in
us, appearing to us like unto Christ. And there was war in heaven, Michael
and his Angels sought against the Dragon, and the Dragon sought, and his
Angels, and prevailed not, neither was their places found any more in heaven.
And the great dragon was cast out, that old Serpent, called the Devil and
Satan, which deceives the whole world, he was cast out into the earth, and his
Angels were cast out with him.

Here is the Devil made known to us how he is in heavenly places, fighting
against Christ: but Christ has overcome him, and cast him out of his heavenly
shape, that he shall not be able to overcome us. He is called a red Dragon,
and a scarlet-colored beast, because he persecutes and destroys the Church
of God: and this Beast is spoken of in many places of the Revelations: and the
woman that sits upon it is the glory and seeming excellency of Antichrist; and
she also is clothed with scarlet-colour, which is persecution. Though she be
clothed in the most glorious manner as can be, with gold, and precious stones,
and pearls, like the glory of Christ, yet this is but to deceive us. And she
has in her hand a golden cup full of abominations, and filthiness of her
fornication. Being she appears so glorious to us, like unto Christ: and the
cup that she gives us to drink of appears so pure and glorious, which
makes us not to question it, but think that it is the cup of salvation: So we
drink of her abhominationr, and commit spiritual fornication with her: and she
sits upon all people, and multitudes, and tongues, and nations, Rev. 17.
She domineereth over us all, and she is carried on swiftly in her abominations
upon the back of the Beast which was full of names of blasphemy, which
blasphemeth the name of God, and ways of God. And he has seven heads,
perfection of wisdom; he knows all the ways of God, and he transformeth
himself to the likentsse of them all: And he has ten horns to persecute
withal, and he makes use of them so far as God suffers him: and he has
all ways to decive us in appearing like a Lamb to us, having two horns like a
Lamb, but speaking like a Dragon, Rev. 13.11. and also appearing like Prophets
in us, Revel. 16.13, 14. And I saw three unclean spirits, like frogs, coming
out of the mouth of the Dragon, and out of the mouth of the Beast, and out of
the mouth of the false Prophet. For they are the spirit of Devils, working
miracles. And the Lord does make the ways of Antichrist appear, laying them
clearly open by the appearance of himself in us: and as he breaks open the
seals to us, there are great earthquakes, Heb. 12.26, 27. Yet once more, I
shake not only the earth, but also heaven. And this word (yet once more)
signifies the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are
made, that those things which cannot be shaken, may remain.

The Lord when he appears in us, does not only make the earth quake at his
presence, which is all things that does appear to us to be below God,
whatsoever it be: but also heavenly things, all glorious things which are of
Antichrist, which is like heaven, and does appear to us to be heaven: but
this shall be shaken by the appearing of Jesus Christ in us: and those things
that cannot be shaken, which are of Jesus Christ, they shall remain: but all
things that are not of him shall fall, and shall appear to us to be but earth,
or flesh, as bad as the kilel of the flesh, gross sin and wickedness; I do
not mean the flesh of our bodies, nor this earth that we dwell upon: but there
are two kinds of seeds of the Devil in us; that gross seed which brings
forth sin in us, is called earth; the first man was of the earth, earthly; as
is the earthly, such are they that are earthly. That which is not of God, is
said to be of Satan, which is called earth: and so far as we have this
earthly seed appearing in us, so far we are of the earth, earthly; then there
is that seeming glorious seed of himself in us, which is our righteousness,
and that seems to be like the ways of God, and therefore it is called heaven:
but it is but of the earth, and is earthly; this is called the first man; the
second man is Christ, and he is heavenly, 1 Cor. 15. The first man is of the
earth, ^arthly, the second man is the Lord from heaven; as is the earthly, such
are they that are ^arthly: and as is the heavenly, such are they ^lso that are
heavenly: and as we have borne the image of the earthly, we shall also bear the
^mage of the heavenly. Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot
inherit the Kingdom ^f God; neither does corruption inherit incorruption. That
which is of Satan which is called ^lesh, and blood, and earth, and corruption,
shall not inherit the Kingdom of God; for this ^shmael shall not be heir with
Isaac: so at the ^ppearing of God in us there will be a great ^arth-quake, when
the mountain of the Lord (which is Christ) comes to be established atop of the
mountains of Antichrist; For thou ^ast said in thy heart, I will ascend into
heaven, (...) will exalt my throne above the Stars of God: I will sit upon the
mount of the Congregation. I will ^scend above the heights of the clouds, I
will be ^ike the most High, Isa. 14.13, 14. The voice ^f my beloved, behold he
comes leaping upon the ^ountains, and skipping upon the hills, Cant. 2.8.
Whether the hills or mountains, though they ^e never so high, that is not of
himself, what^oever it be in us, whether high or great sins, ^r our
righteousness, he will tread them all under his feet, and triumph over them
all: and this mount makes the whole earth filen^ before him both outward and
inward, and make them quake, Revel. 6.12, 13, 14. And (...) beheld when he had
opened the sixth;seal, and lo^^ there was a great earthquake, and the Sun
became black as a sacke-cloath of hair, and the Moon became as blood. And
the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casts he^
untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind. And the Heaven departed
as a scroll when it is rolled together, and every mountain and Island were
moved out of their places Mat. 24.29. Immediately after those days shall the
Sun be darkened, and the Moon shall not giv^ her light, and the stars shall
fall from heaven, and the powers of heaven shall be shall be shaken. And then
shall appear the sign of the Son of man is heaven; and then shall all the
Tribes of the eart^ mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the
clouds with power and great glory.

Here is speaking of Christ's coming to judgment: The coming of Christ to
judgment is both outward and inward; spirituall^ in the mystery: and at the
opening of the sixt^^ seal here is the first resurrection; for after the Sun
is darkened, and the Moon not give he^ light, then shall Christ appear in his
glory i^ us; he is come to this spiritual judgment i^ us, and by his glorious
appearance he makes the Sun to appear as black as a sackcloth of hair, and
the Moon to be like blood: But while the first Heaven is departed away, his
glory does not appear in us; for the first heaven hinders us from seeing the
glory of Christ; the Sun is that whereby we see, for that is light it self,
and gives light to us, and by that light that we receceive from the Sun, we
see the Sun: and that light that the Moon has, she receives it from the Sun;
it is the same light infused into the Moon, but it does not appear so glorious
as the Sun; for the Sun is the fullness of light, and the Moon partakes of it
all, but is not able to contain it all, but is filled with the light and glory
of it: and the stars have that light that they shine withal from the Sun,
and is the same with the Moon, and they give a bright, clear, and glorious
light, yet not so full and great a light as the Moon does; for they are not
able to contain it: and this typifieth out to us Christ and his Church, and
every particular Saint; for Christ is the Sun, and the Church the Moon, and
the Saints the Stars. Now where the Church of God is, there is also the
church of Antichrist, and the light that she has is infused after the same
manner, and all in us: and both these lie together, that as we are men and
women, we do not know one light from the other: but when Christ does appear
to us in his pure light, then the light of the sun of Antichrist in us will
appear as black as sackcloth of hair, and that moon, the Church of
Antichrist, will appear like blood, being a bloody persecuter of the Church
of God: and the stars of Antichrist will also fall; for being that sun is
darkened whereby the stars receives their light, they must fall: and that
heavenly and glorious appearance of Antichrist shall depart as a scroll when
it is rolled together. And then every mountain and Island shall be moved out of
their places; for now is the day of the Lord come to render vengeance on all
things in us that knows not God. Now is the time of the destruction of
Antichrist come, and he is not able to stand against it; for by the
manifestation of the appearance of Jesus Christ, revealing himself in his
glory by his Spirit, does destroy Antichrist; for by the preaching of the
Gospel this City Babylon does fall. When the Spirit of God does teach us to
know what the Gospel of Christ is to us, and in us, this does come with power,
and does overthrow Antichrist in us: and the outward preaching of the Word
alone will not do it, but the spirit working with it does do it: and the Lord
is well pleased to make use of the outward preaching of the word to work upon
us by his Spirit commonly: but he is not bound to one way; he works upon us
by his Spirit with means, or without means, or against means, yet it is one
spirit that does work upon us suitable to the Word, he would not have us under
value the outward preaching of the Gospel, nor yet idolize it, Revel. 8.1, 2.
And after these things I saw another Angel come down from heaven, having great
power, and the earth was lightened with his glory. And he cried mightily with a
strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, and is become the habitation
of Devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and
hateful bird. All manner of unclean things has lodged in her, but we did not
see it, but now the Lord will show us it. Reward her even as she has rewarded
you, double unto her double according to her works; In the cup which she has
filled, fill to her double. How much she has glorified her self. and lived
deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her. For she says in her heart,
I sit a Queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow; therefore shall her
plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine. And she shall he
utterly burnt with fire, for strong is the Lord God that judges her, Revel.
18.6, 7, 8. He does double the cup of his wrath and indignation against her,
and does destroy her, and burn her up with the fire of himself; we cannot do
it, but he is strong and able to do^ it, and does do it for us: and the fruits
that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee and all things which were
dainty and goodly are departed from thee, and thou shall find^ them no more at
all, Rev. 18.14. And a mighty Angel took up a stone like a great mil-stone,
and cast it into the Sea, saying, thus with violence shall that great City
Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all. And the voice o^
harpers, and musicians, and of pipers and trumpeters shall be heard no more at
all in thee: and n^ Crafts-man of whatsoever Craft shall be found no more in
thee, and the found of a mil-stone shall be heard no more at all in thee. And
the light of (...) candle shall shine no more at all in thee, and the voice of
the Bridegroom and of the Bride shall be heard no more at all in thee; for
thy Merchants were the great men of the Earth; for by thy forceries were all
Nations deceived. And in her to (...) found the blood of Prophets, and of
Saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth, Rev. 18.21, 22, 23, 24.

Here is an utter destruction of her, and this is that veil that keeps us
from seeing the glory of Christ; for he that keeps from him is a veil; or if
we see him but darkely, it is because the vail is not quite done away. There
was a vail before the Tabernacle, which is called the holiest of all; In which
Tabernacle were all the glorious and excellent things, Heb. (...).3, 4. And
thou shall make a veil of blue, and ^urple, and scarlet, and fine twined
linen of tun^ing work: with Cherubims shall it be made. And thou shall hang
it upon four pillars of Shi^tim ^ood, overlaid with gold; their books shall be
of ^old upon the sockets of silver. And thou shall ^ong up the veil under the
tackes, that thou may ^ring in thither within the veil, the Arc of the
Testimony: And the vail shall divide unto you between the holy places, and
the most holy, Exodus ^6.31, 32, 33, 34.

There was three places in this Tabernacle; first, the Priests went always
into the first Ta^ernacle, accomplishing the service of God: ^ut into the
second went the High Priest alone ^nce every year; not without blood, which ^e
offered for himself, and for the errors of ^he people. The holy Ghost thus
signifying, that the holiest of all was not yet made mani^^st, Heb. 9.6, 7, 8.
For that glorious veil ^oth hide it quite from us, Luke 23.45. The Sun was
darkened, and the veil of the Temple was ^^nt in the midst. Mat. 27.51. And
behold, the veil of the Temple was rent in taine from the top to ^he bottom,
and the earth did quake, and the ^ockes rent. Christ by his death did rend the
vail that does keep us from the seeing of him. Moses after he had seen, and
talked with God, he appeared so glorious, that the people could not look upon
him, and then he put a vail over his face. Moses was a type of Christ, and he
had a veil over him, that they could not see him, which were types and
shadows: and through that veil they saw Christ darkely, 2 Cor. 3.11, 12, 13,
14. Seeing we have such hope we use great plainness of speech. And not as Moses
which put a veil over his face, that the children of Israel could not
steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished? But their minds were
blinded; for until this day remains the same veil untaken away in the
reading of the old Testament, which veil is done away in Christ. But even unto
this day when Moses is read, the veil is upon their hearts. Nevertheless,
when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away. Now the Lord is
that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. When the
Lord does open the seals to us, and comes with power in us by his Spirit, then
he turns us to himself, and shows us by degrees that this veil that
hinders us from seeing him, is taken away by him, and so by degrees we shall
see him as he is; and then we shall seee what bondage we were in to sin and
Satan, and our own selves, and how we are set at liberty by Christ, John
8.36. If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.
Isa. 25.7.8. And destroy in this mountain in the face of the covering cast
over all people, and the veil that is spread over all Nations. He will swallow
death in victory, 1 Cor. 15.54. This death, and this veil is one and the same;
for both of them keeps us from seeing life, which is Christ: For while we live
to our selves, and to our righteteousnesse, so far we are dead to Christ. Now
as he manifests himself in us, he swallows up this death, and we shall see
our selves live in his life, and dead to that life that we did live to our
selves. Thus the Lord will strip us of all our excellent things, bringing us
into the wilderness, and showing us that all our works are burnt up, so far as
they are of us: but that which is of God in us, is not burnt up, but is purged
from our dross, and will appear very glorious, and will make us silent; for
we shall have nothing to boast of, but confess that it is Christ in us which
is that glory; then we shall ^e that he is no respecter of persons; for
whatsoever he be, whether he be a strict Jew, as the Jews were very strict, as
ye may see by Paul before his conversion. Or a Gentile, one that makes no show
of godliness, but lives very loos^y, as those Gentiles did which are spoken of
^n Romans 1. yet when Christ reveals himself to them, they shall find that his
love is the same to them, as to them that have been most strictest. When the
Lord of the Vineyard sent laborers into his Vineyard, he sent some at the
first hour, and some at the third hour, and some at the sixth hour, and some at
the eleventh hour: and when he came to pay them, he began with him that went
in last, and he had as much given him as he that went in first, Mat. 20. Those
that are but young Saints, that have been but lately brought into Christ, the
Lord does many times reveal himself in a very glorious manner to them, before
he does to them that have labored in the Lords Vineyard a great while, and
have had the seed of God appearing in them a great while, Mat. 29.30. But many
that are first shall be last, and the last shall be first, That we may know
that God is no respecter of persons; for we are all one body, and his love is
as great to one member, as to another, Ephesians. 4.4, 5, 6. There is one body and
one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling. One Lord, one
faith, one Baptism. One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through
all, and in you all, Col. 3.11. Christ is all, and in all the Saints.

CHAP. XVIII. How glorious the glory of Christ will appear in his Church, when
he brings them out of the Wilderness.
When Christ has stripped his Church off of all her goodly things, then she
has nothing to trust too, but on Christ. Isa. 2. Then the lofty looks of man
shall be humbled, and the baughtinesse of men shall be bowed down, and the
Lord alone shall be exalted in that day. For the day of the Lord of Hosts shall
be upon every one that is proud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted
up: and he shall be brought low, and the Idols he shall utterly abolish. And
they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the ^aves of the Earth,
for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of his Majesty, when he arises to
shake terribly the earth. In that a man shall cast his Idols of silver, and his
Idols of god, (which they made every one for himself to worship) to the Moles
and to the Bats. Hosea 14.8. Ephraim ^^all say, what have I to do any more
with Idols? Isa. 31.7. For in that day every man shall ^ast away his Idols of
silver, and his Idols of gold, which your own hands have made, for a sin.

When this day of the Lord is come to us, then we shall be willing to cast
them away, because the Lord shows us the odiousness of them by the glory of
himself revealed in us: but before this day is come to us, we had rather part
from any thing than part from them. But when he comes to give a full possession
of himself, then we are willing to part from all thing that are not of
himself: but he does not reveal all his glory to us at once, but reveals
himself to us by degrees, as we are able to bear and contain him: And as
he shows himself to us, so he shows us Antichrist and his destruction; for
the more incomes we have of Christ, the more of self and Satan does appear
to us, and is destroyed more and more by this fire of Christ. For he does
baptize us with the holy Ghost and fire, Mat. 5. Acts 2. Who among us shall
dwell with devouring fire? who amongst us shall dwell with everlasting
burnings, Isa. 33.14.

This fire of the Spirit of God never goes out, but is always burning up that
in us that is contrary to it self, that there may be all the dross burnt up:
And this fire is in Sion, and his furnace in Jerusalem, Isa. 31.9. which is the
Church of God. Who is this that comes up from the wilderness leaning upon
her Beloved? Cant. 8.5.

The Spouse of Christ see^ all other things fail her, and she leans now
wholly upon her Beloved; she is of her self like a barren wilderness: but
now he will cause the fui^ts of his Spirit to appear, to grow and flourish in
her.

The Wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and the desert
shall rejoice, and blossom as a rose. It shall blossom abundantly, and
rejoice even with joy and singing; the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it,
the excellency of Carmel and Sharon, they shall see the glory of the Lord, and
the excellency of our God, Isa. 35.12. The Spirit shall be powered upon us from
on high, and the Wilderness be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be
counted for a Forest. Then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness, and
righteousness remain in the fruitful field. And the work of righteousness
shall be peace, and the effect of righteousness, quietness, and assurance for
ever. And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure
dwellings, and in quiet resting places, and none shall make her afraid, Isa.
32.15, 16, 17, 18.

Now is the time come, for us to see that the marriage day is come, when he
does come and manifest himself in us in a glorious way, to tell us what he is
to us, and in us, and what we are in him, and to him, when he thus comes to
us; that day is the marriage day to us. Rev. 19.7, 8, 9. Let us be glad,
rejoice and give honor to him, for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his
Wife has made her self ready. And to her was granted that she should be
arraied in fine linen, clean and white; for the fine linen is the
righteousness of Saints.

And he said unto me, write, blessed are they that are called to the marrioge
supper of the Lamb. And he said unto me, These are the true sayings of God,
Rev. 20.9, 10, 11. And there came unto me one of the seven Angels, and talked
with me, and said unto me, Come hither, and I will show thee the Bride, the
Lambs Wife. And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high
mountain, and showed me that great City, the holy Jerusalem, descending out
of heaven from God, having the glory of God. And her light was like unto a
stone most precious, even like a Jasper stone, clear as crystal.

The Bride of Christ is the Church of God, and it is descended out of Heaven
from God, for it is one with him; for it is the Spirit of God in all the
children of God, that is this body, the Church. The Bride and this descends
from God into us, yet it is not parted from him, but is in him, and this is
clothed with the glory of God. This is that righteousness of the Saints, and
her light is the light of Christ, and that light is the clearest, and purest,
and most precious and glorious light that can be. I will appear glorious in
thee, Isa. 49.3.

Awake, awake, put on thy Strength O Sion, put on thy beautiful garments, O
Jerusalem, the holy City, for henceforth there shall no more come into thee;
the uncircumcised and the unclean. Shake thy self from the dust, arise and
sit down, O Jerusalem, loose thy self from the bands of thy neck, O captive
daughter of Sion, Isa. 52.1, 2.

She was in a sleepy, drousie condition, so long as she sat in the dust of
that earth of Antichrist, and was a captive in his band? But now our Beloved
is come, he calls unto us to awake, and to put on strength. The Lord is the
strength of my life, of whom shall I be afraid? Psalm 27.1. Psalm 28.7. He
has clothed us with his strength: And this is that beautiful garment.

Arise, shine, for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon
thee. For behold, the darkenesss shall cover the earth, and gross darkness
the people: but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen
upon thee, Isa. 60.1, 2. And the glory that thou have given me, I have given
them, John 17.22.

The Spouse of Christ being clothed with the glory of Christ, she is all
glorious. The Kings daughter is all glorious within. We are the King of
heavens daughters, for we are married to Christ, and God the Father is our
Father, and we are all glorious within.

It is the Spirit of God in us that is so glorious, and this is a spiritual
glory, it cannot be seen outwardly by others; they may hear us speak forth
something of this glory in us, but none sees it nor knows it, but those that
have it, Revel. 2.17. To him that overcommeth will I give to eat of the hidden
Manna: and I will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written,
which no man knows, saving him that has it.

This Manna is Christ, and he is hid from the world, but as we are Saints, we
see it, and feed upon it; for it is that which we live by, and this stone is
Christ, 1 Pet. 2.6. And this is a very precious stone: and here is a new name
written in this stone, that none does know it but he that has it. And that
which is written in it is the manifestation of the exceeding riches of the love
and mercy of God, and all his glory and excellency which he has given us as
we are Saints.

Christ does set forth the beauty and comeliness, and glory of his Church,
having his beauty, and comeliness, and glory on her, Cant. 4. Cant. 7. Thou
have ravished my heart my Sister, my Spouse, thou have ravished my heart with
one of thy eyes, with one chain of thy neck. How fair is thy love, my Sister,
my Spouse, how much better is thy love than wine, and the smell of thy
ointments, than all spices. Thy lips (O my Love) drop as the honey-combe; honey
and milk are under thy tongue, and the smell of thy garments is like the smell
of Lebanon.

This ointment that our Beloved is so taken with the smell of, is the anointing
of the holy Ghost, 1 John 2.27. The anointing which ye have received of him
abides in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same
anointing teaches you all things, and is truth, and is no lie: and even as he
has taught you, ye shall abide in him.

The Priests and Kings used to be anointed with oil, and it was a type of
Christ; he was that King and Priest that was anointed with the holy Ghost.
Psalm 45.6, 7. Thy throne (O God) is for ever and ever; the scepter of thy
kingdom is ascepter of righteousness. Thou love righteousness, and hate
wickedness, because God, thy God, has anointed thee with the oil of
gladness above thy fellows.

And this is like that precious ointment upon the head, that runs upon the
beard, even unto Aarons beard, which wet down on the border of his garments,
Psalm. 133.2.

This ointment of the Spirit of God is all of it poured upon this Priest,
Christ, which is the head of the Church, and it runs off from him down upon all
the Saints: and this ointment of the Spirit of God makes our garments smell so
sweet, which is that Wedding garment, Mat. 22.12. which is the righteousness
of the Saints, Revel. 19.8. And being filled with this Spirit, causes our lips
to speak, or drop forth sweet, heavenly, glorious things, more sweeter to the
soul, than the honey and honeycomb is to the pallet. The Spouse of Christ is
exceeding glorious in every respect; being in Christ, she is perfect in him. I
in them, and they in me, that they may be made perfect in one, John 17.23. That
they all may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they also
may be one in us, John 17.21. Put on charity, which is the bond of
perfectness, Coloss. 3.14. which is Christ: And where he is, there is
perfection, Col. 1.27, 28. To whom God would ^ake known what is the riches of
the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in ^ou, the hope
of glory: Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all
wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus.

We are perfect in Christ as we are Saints, and are the Church of God; for
this Spirit of Christ in us is perfect: but as we are men and women we are not
perfect; for we are natural and not spiritual: and as we are natural, we
cannot discern the things of God, neither can we do them, 1 Cor. 2.14. But it
is this Spirit of God in us that does all: and if he withdraw his Spirit from
us, we shall run into all sin, if he does not restrain us; for our bodies
are the same as they were, before the Spirit of God appeared in us: and by his
reigning in us he suppresseth, destroys, and burns up by degrees as he
reveals himself in us, all things that are contrary to him: and he brings
our wills into subjection to his, for we are led by his Spirit: and being
filled with his Spirit, we are made drunk as it were with it: and being
overcome, and wholly swallowed up in it, we are what the Spirit would have us
to be, and think, speak, and do what it would have us We are no longer our
own, but Gods, and his will is become ours, and our will is to do^ his will,
and is become his: so we are now no longer twain, but one: and all our
deligh^ is wholly in him, and all his delight is wholly in us; for it is the
manifestation of his love to us that causes us to love him, and the more we
see him, the more we shall love him: and we cannot see him, but we shall be
like him, for we shall see our selves the same in him; for as he is, so shall
we be in this world as we are Saints: and the seeing of him by his Spirit,
does cleanse us in our conversations: So far as we have seen him, we shall
be like him in our conversations, for we shall hate all sin: and so far as
we live in God, we shall have neither will nor power to do any thing that is
contrary to him, so far as he reveals himself in us: and that is by
degrees, enlarging our vessels, and filling us with himself, as we are able
to bear him: and when he reigns in us, we also reign with him over all
things in us that is contrary to himself, and this is the time of Satan's being
bound, Rev. 20. For Babylon in us being fallen, whereby Satan has overcome us:
and Christ himself having taken possession in us, he binds Satan that he
cannot ^o what he would against us; yet many times God does let out the link
of Satan's chain: and so far as he has power given him to go, ^e does wind
every way into us and will by his ^cting in us ecclips the glory of God: but
he ^^all not overcome us; this shall be for the glory of God, and for an
humbling to us, and ^^aking us to see that all things that are good, ^re of
God: and how weak we are, and rea^y to fall if he with-drawes himself: but
he ^ill draw back this chain of Satan, and his ^lory shall appear more
glorious in us, and ^his perfection of Christ shall be revealed more and more
in us, and we shall see our selves ^ore and more like him, 2 Cor. 3.18. But we
all ^ith open face beholding a^ in a glass the glory of ^he Lord, are changed
into the same image from ^lory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.

And this Church of God is called a garden, ^here all manner of choice fruit
grow, which (...) the fruit of his Spirit in us, and he does water ^t and make
it fruitful, and keeps it night and ^ay, and is as a wall and bul-worke about
it, ^o keep out all our enemies: and the greatest ^annon-shot as can be shot
by the Devil against us, this bul-work will defend us against (...); for it
cannot pierce it, nor do us any harm.

CHAP. XIX. Christ being come into his garden, does feast his Spouse, and his
Spouse is feasted with him.
THe Spouse of Christ has been as a garden enclosed, a spring shut up, and
fountain sealed up, that she has not appeared what she is: but she has
been hidden in Christ: And now he says, I am come into my Garden, my Sister,
my Spouse, Cant. 5.1. He was ever in his Garden, feasting himself, though we
saw it not, but now he makes it known to us that he is come in his glory to
marry us to himself, and to sit down together at this heavenly Table, and
eat of those spiritual dainties that he has prepared for us, and to rejoice
together, and to remain always together: and the first thing that he does,
when he is come into us that are his Saints (for that is his Garden) he calls
unto us, Cant. 2. My beloved spoke, and said unto me, Rise up my Love, my fair
one, and come away. For lo the winter is past, the rain is over, and gone,
the flowers appear on the earth, ^he time of the singing of birds is come, and
the ^oyce of the Turtle is heard in our Land. The fig^ee puts forth her
green figs, and the vines ^ith the tender grape give a good smell. Arise my
^^ve, my fair one, and come away. O my dove, ^hou art in the cleft of the
rock, in the secret pla^es of the stairs: let me see thy countenance, let ^^e
hear thy voice, for sweet is thy voice, and thy ^^untenance is comely.

She lay in the clefts of that rock Christ Je^us: and when she was in the
clefts, she could ^ot see the full glory of that rock wherein she ^ay: But
there she was hid while the storms of ^he winter were past, that is: Before
Jesus Christ has manifested his love and goodness ^o us: and when this sun
appears but low (...) us, then there is much darkness and gloo^inesse in us,
and much coldness, and then ^e storms of Satan arises against us: but now ^ee
is risen in his glory with a burning heat, ^^d laid the storms of Satan, and
has burnt ^^p all that has hindered us from seeing him: ^^d now he bids us
come away; for he tells us ^^e winter is past, that which hindered us is ^one;
now the spring, Christ Jesus is come, ^^d his voice, which is that pure Turtle,
is ^eard in our Land, that is, in us, and he cau^th all that is of himself in
us to appear and grow fruitful and flourish, though they be but young and
tender at the spring, at the first appearing of Christ's manifesting himself in
us, yet they give a good smell, and our beloved takes a great delight in them,
and he calls twice to her to come away that he might behold her, for she is very
comely and beautiful, and glorious; for she is one with him, and she is
attired in the glorious robes of Christ, and all his rich ornaments are upon
her, and his crown of glory. And when he looks upon her, he is ravished with
her; that is, he is overcome with the sight of her, all his love runs forth
to her. There is not any two lovers upon earth that their love can be so great
as the love of Christ and his Spouse is one to the other: and she is called
forth to behold him, Cant. 3.11. Go forth, O ye daughters of Sion, and behold
King Solomon with the Crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of
his spousall, and in the day of the gladness of his heart.

Christ is compared to King Solomon, because he had the most glory of any King
upon the earth: and in the day of Christ's Espousall, does his glory appear to
us, and the gladness of his heart, and all is for joy of his marriage to us,
and it is his joy for us to behold it: and she beholding her beloved in his
glory, and seeing his love to her, she is also ravished and wholly overcome,
and swallowed up in him, in seeing him to be her beloved. My beloved is mine,
and I am his, he feeds among the lilies, Cant. 3.16. Christ compares his
Spouse to lilies. As the lilly among thorns, so is my love among the daughters,
Cant. 2.2.

The lilly is counted the most glorious thing that grows in the field, Mat.
6.28, 29. Consider the lillies of the field how they grow, they toil not,
neither do they spin? and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory
was not arrayed like one of these.

This field is all the world, and the Saints are these lillies, and the other
are but thorns. Both those that are of the world which is not of Jesus Christ,
and also that which is in us, which is not of Christ, are like thorns to keep
these lilies from growing, and do what they can to choke this seed of God in
us, which are these lilies, Mat. 13.7. And she compares her Beloved to an
apple tree. As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved
among the sons. I sat under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was
sweet to my taste, Cant. 2.3. He is a tree of life which bears twelve manner
of fruits, and yields her fruit every month, Revel. 22.2. And here is all
pleasant fruit upon it, and is never barren: and the fruit of this apple tree
we feed upon: and whosoever has tasted of this fruit, does know that it is
very pleasant: and after we have tasted of it, nothing else will content us to
feed upon but that, and this tree is a shadow and refuge against all storms and
tempests, and here we fit quietly feeding upon him: but he brings us further,
and leads us into his banqueting house that he might feed us with all his
dainties, for they are all prepared for us, Cant. 2.4, 5, 6. He brought me to
the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love. Stay me with flagons,
and comfort me with apples, for I am sick of love. His left hand is under my
head, and his right hand does embrace me. When he does feed us with his
heavenly dainties, and embraces us with the arm of his love, we are not able
to contain our selves; we are so ravished with him, that we are even sick
with love: but he stais us even when we are sick for the enjoyment of him,
before he does appear so glorious in us; then he stays us with the flagons of
the wine of his Spirit: and of those apples, some manifestations of himself in
us, to stay and up-hold us. And when he is come in that glorious manner in us,
which we have so longed for, to give us a a possession of himself, and to
remain in us for ever. He does appear in us so sweets, precious and glorious,
that we are not able to contain it; the enjoyment of him fills us so with joy,
that it makes us sick, being we cannot contain it: but he does up-hold us while
he does embrace us, enlarging our vessel, and so filling us. I am my beloveds,
and his desire is to me. Come my beloved, let us go forth into the field: let
us lodge in the villages. Let us get up early to the vineyard, let us see if
the vine flourish, whether the tender grapes appear, and the pomegranates bud
forth, there will I give thee my loves. The man drakes give a smell, and at our
gates are all manner of pleasant fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for
thee, O my beloved! Cant. 7.10, 11, 12, 13. All his desire is to us, and to go
with him to see how the fruits of the Spirit of God does flourish in us, which
are his vineyard or garden. He is not contented to feast himself in us, but
for us to go with him, and he to feast us, for his whole delight is ^n us.
Father, I will that they also which thou have given me, be with me where I am,
that they may bebold my glory, John 17.24. For all those excellent things that
is in him, is for us his beloved, whether old or new manifestations of his
glory in us, and all that is in us is for him; like the rivers that comes from
the Sea, and runs to the Sea again: so Christ does fill us with himself: and
all these streams of himself in us does wholly flow forth to him; We are
willing for him to have all the honor, glory, and praise; we are so deeply in
love with him, that we think nothing too dear for him. All that is ours is
for him; yea, our lives, if he call for them; we are sorry that we cannot
express our love to him as we would; for our bodies are a prison to us: but all
our love is wholly run forth to him, and his love is the like to us. Here is
perfect love that casts out fear, 1 John 4.18. This is the love that is as
strong as death, and it is like fire which has a most vehement flame. Many
waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: If a man would
give all the substance of his house for love, it would be utterly condemned,
Cant. 8.6, 7. And our love is made known in a great high measure one to the
other. Our beloved is altogether lovely, and more to be desired than all the
things in the world. His mouth is most sweet: and let him kiss me with the
kisses of his mouth, for his love is better than wine.

Out of the mouth comes the full expression of that love of Christ that is in
his heart to us, and by his kissing us, which is a very high expression of his
love to us. My beloved it gone down into his garden: to the beds of spices, ^o
feed in the garden, and to gather lillies. I am my ^eloveds, and my beloved is
mine: be feeds among ^he lillies, Cant. 6.2, 3. I am come into my garden, my
sister, my Spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice, I have eaten my
honeycomb with my ^oney, I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat O friends?
drink ye, drink abundantly, O belo^ed. Here he does feast himself with the
^weet fruits of his Spirit in us; that is compa^ed to all precious fruits which
grow upon ^his tree of life, Christ in us. He says, I will ^oe up to the
palm tree, I will take hold of the ^oughes thereof: now also thy breasts shall
be as clu^ters of the vine, and the smell of thy nose like apples. And the roof
of thy mouth like the best wine, for ^y beloved, that goes down sweetly,
causing the ^ips of those that are asleep, to speak, Cant. 7.8, ^. Here does
Christ set forth what excellent ^ruits here is in this garden, which he does
ga^her, and feeds upon it. Her breasts shall be as ^he clusters of the vine:
and that vine is Christ, ^ohn 15. and that is the breast that she is nou^ished
by. And the roof of thy mouth is like the ^est wine. Out of our mouths is
uttered ^orth the praise, glory, and excellency of our ^eloved, and this wine
is for our beloved, and ^e drinks of it: and this wine is the fruit of this
^ine, Christ; and whosoever he gives this ^ine too, to drink of it, it goes
down very sweetly, and causes the lips of them that are asleep to speak:
before Christ appears in us we are asleep as the Spouse was, Cant. 5.2. in a
dead an drowsy condition: but now we shall be roused up, and speak forth the
praise of our beloved, Cant. 8.2. I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine,
of the juice of the pomegranates. This is the fruit that grows in this
garden, and it is for our beloved to feast himself upon: and he says, I have
eaten and drank, and do take great delight in this feast, because thou art with
me: and do you eat and drink abundantly with me; for it is my delight to have
you feasted, for they are prepared for you: and this feast is our love feast;
for it is our marriage feast, and it is my love that you are to feed upon: and
do not spare, but eat and drink abundantly of it, and be drunk with it, for
there is more love yet behind than you can see, and it is all for you, and this
love will make you fruitful; for by the love of God to us, we bring forth
fruits to God. This will make us that we shall be neither barren nor
unfruitful; here is the Church of God in the glory of Christ, and married to
Christ, and is one with God in Christ, and fits in heavenly places in Christ
Jesus, Ephesians. 2.6. And is feasted with Christ Jesus, and he is feasted with
her, and she appears glorious in his glory.

CHAP. XX. A new Song sung unto God.
WHen we come to see what God has done for us in Christ Jesus, how he has
destroyed this Babylon in us, and has bound Satan, and swallowed up the veil
that hindered us from seeing him: and we come to see him, and see what we are
in him, and how we are married to him. There will be much joy and rejoicing
for the destruction of our spiritual enemy, and for joy of the marriage of
the Lamb and the Saints. The finger of God will play upon the wel-stringed
instrument of mus^que, (which is the Spirit of God in us) playing heavenly
tunes, and new songs that we never sung before. For first, there is a rejoicing
for the manifestation of the love of God to us in Christ. He has made us Kings
and Priests to God and his Father, and we shall reign with him for ever. And I
heard a great voice out of heaven, saying; Behold, the Tabernacle of God is
with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God
himself shall be with them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away all
tears from their eyes, and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow nor
crying, neither shall there be any more pain, for the former things are passed
away, Rev. 21.3, 4. The cause of our crying and mourning either for spiritual,
or for outward things, is because we do not clearly see God what he is to us,
and that all that he does to us is in love: and that he will have his own
time to bring to pass his own will in his own way, both spiritual and
temporal, for the glory! of his Name, and for our good; when we come to be
really sensible of this, then we shall see that we have no cause of mourning;
then shall our tears be wiped from our eyes. Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be
glad with her all ye that love her; rejoice for joy with her, all ye that
mourn for her, Isa. 66.10. For behold I create new heavens, and a new earth:
and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind. But be you glad and
rejoice for ever in that which I create: for behold I create Jerusalem a
rejoicing, and her people a joy. And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my
people, and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice
of crying, Isa. 65.17, 18, 19. And the Lord will cause righteousness and
praise to spring forth before all the Nations: and I will direct their work in
truth, and I will make (...) everlasting Covenant with them. And their seed
shall he known among the Gentiles, and their offspring among the people: All
that see them shall acknowledge them, that they are the seed which the Lord
has blessed. I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my soul shall be joyful in
my God: for be has clothed me with the garments of salvation, he has
covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a Bridegroom decketh himself
with ornaments, and as a Bride adorneth her self with jewels: everlasting joy
shall be unto them, Isa. 61. As there are new manifestations of God in us: so
there will be new songs of joy and rejoicing in the Lord. And I heard a voice
from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder:
and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps. And they sang as it
were a new song before the Throne, and no man could learn that song but the
hundred and forty, and four thousand which were redeemed from the earth, Rev.
14.2, 3. And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire, and them that
had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark,
and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps
of God. And they sung the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the
Lamb, saying, great and mavelous are thy works, Lord God Almighty. Just and
true are thy ways, thou King of Saints. Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and
glorify thy Name? for thou only art holy: for all Nations shall come and
worship before thee, for thy judgments are made manifest, Revel. 15.2, 3, 4.
This sea of glass is Christ, and none can stand upon him but the Saints; for
it is too slippery for any other to stand upon it, for they will fall: and this
fire that is mingled with this glass will burn them up: but here the Saints
stand with joy, singing a new song, and rejoicing in the Lord exceedingly; the
joy is beyond expression, none can know it, but they that have the enjoyment of
it, to see and know that Christ has overcome and destroyed all our spiritual
enemies in us, for he has thrown down Babylon in us.

And after these things, I heard a great voice of much people in heaven,
saying: Allelujah, salvation, and glory, and honor, and power be unto the Lord
our God: For true and righteous are his judgments, for he has judged the great
Whore which did corrupt the Earth with her fornication, and has avenged the
blood of his servants at her hand. And again they said Allelujah, and her smoke
rose up for ever and ever. And the four and twenty Elders, and the four beasts
fell down and worshipped God that sat upon the Throne, saying, Amen,
Allelujah. And a voice came out of the Thron^, saying, Praise our God all ye
his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great. And I heard as it
were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as
the voice of mighty thundrings, saying, Allelujah; for the Lord God o^^^^potent
reigns, Revel. 19. The four and twenty Elders are thought to be the Prophets
and Apostles; for by them was the mind of God made known: and these four
beasts ye shall find spoken of in the first of Ezekiel. Rev. 4. which was moved
by the Spirit of God, and was continually praising God. And this heaven where
there is such a noise of joy and rejoicing and praising God, is the Church of
God, here is the singing of birds, Cant. 2.12. Because the voice of this
Turtle, our beloved Bridegroom, our sweet Savior Jesus Christ, his sweet
voice of love and peace to us, and joy and rejoicing in us is heard by us, and
we see all things that has hindered us from seeing him, is destroyed by him;
for these earthen pitchers of Antichrist in us, wherein the lamps of the light
and glory of God lies hid. These pitchers being broke by Christ, then the
glory of God appears, Judges 7. And then the trumpets will sound forth the
praises of God; our tongues shall be as a trumpet, being blown by the Spirit of
God, to sound forth the praises of our God: and this sound shall be heard
throughout the whole world; for the Lord will come in his time, and reign in
all his Saints throughout the whole world, and throughout the whole world shall
this trumpet be sounded, and it will cause a great earthquake; for all things
that are not of God, shall be exceeding fraid and troubled; for as the Saints
joy increases more and more by Christ manifesting himself in us; so shall the
sorrow of those that are not the children of God increase more and more.
Rejoice ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the
earth, and of the sea, for the Devil is come down unto you, having great
wrath, because he knows that he has but a short time, Rev. 12.12. For the
light of these lamps, and the sound of these trumpets does terrify our
spiritual enemies, and causes them to fly: and let us do as the four and
twenty Elders did, fall down at the feet of Christ. And when those beasts
gave glory, and honor, and thanks to him that sat on the Throne, who lives
for ever and ever, The four and twenty Elders fell down before him that sat
on the Throne, and worshipped him that lives for ever and ever: and cast their
crowns before the throne, saying, Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory,
and honor, and power: for thou have created all things, and for thy pleasure
they are and were created, Rev. 4.9, 10, 11. These Elders that God had revealed
himself unto in such a high and glorious way, and made them instruments to
make his mind known to all people, and crowned them with his crown of glory;
these cast their Crowns at the feet of God, for it was he in Christ that did
make known his mind by them: and as he deserves all the honor and praise,
so let us be willing for him to have all the honor; for we have this treasure
in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of
us, 2 Cor. 4.7. It is he that does all in us, and let him have all; for it is
the glory of the Saints for Christ to have all the glory, and for us to be
abased and cast down as low as may be at the feet of Christ, and for him
alone to be exalted in us. There is one seal more to be broke open; for this
is the sixth seal, and the first resurrection, and now is Satan bound: but he
must be again let loose for a little season, Revel. 20. He shall have power
given him of God, and will transform himself to the likeness of this glory
to deceive us: but he shall never have his will of the Saints; for when he
thinks to deceive us in this way, the Lord breaks open the seventh seal; then
is the whole mystery of God made known, and then shall the seventh trumpet of
perfection of joy and rejoicing sound forth the praises of God in the days of
the seventh Angel, when he shall begin to blow the Trumpet, even the mystery of
God shall be finished, as he has declared to his servants the Prophets, Rev.
10.7. And now we see but in part, and know but in part, and so we have an
enjoyment of God but in part: but when that which is perfect is come, that
which is in part shall be done away: and now we see him but darkly, but then we
shall see him face to face, and behold him as he is in his full glory: and when
we come to have this seal broke open to us, then we shall know when the time
is for the breaking of it open, and how it is, and what it is that we shall
enjoy: and in the mean time let us not be inquisitive to know when it shall be,
or how it shall be; for we shall not know till then, and then we shall know
whether it be here while we live in this world, or hereafter, when all things
are dissolved: but let us leave that to God, and to him commit our selves,
rejoicing always in the Lord. To whom be all honor, praise and glory given,
both now, and for evermore, Amen.

FINIS.
