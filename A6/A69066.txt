A SVMME OF CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE: COMPOSED IN LATIN, By the R. Father P.
CANISIVS, of the Society of JESUS.

With an Appendix of the fall of Man and Justification, according to the
Doctrine of the Council of Trent.

Newly translated into English.

To which is adioined the explication of certain Questions not handled at
large in the Book as shall appear in the Table.

2 Thessalonians. 3, 6. We denounce unto you, Brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ, that you withdraw your selves from every Brother walking inordinately,
and not according to the Tradition which they have received of us. Against
those which are ignorant of things necessary to salvation.
AVG. de great. and Lib. arb. Cap. 3. NO man must run to the darkness of
ignorance, that in them he may seek an excuse. For one thing it is not to
have known, and another thing to have refused to know. For the will is
reprehended in him of whom it is said, he would not understand, that he might
do well. Yea that very ignorance which is not of those who will not know, but of
those who simply do not know, does excuse no man so that he shall not burn
with the everlasting fire, if therefore he did not believe, because he never
heard what he might believe: but perhaps that he may burn more tolerably.
For not without cause was it said: Power out thy anger upon the nations, which
have not known thee. And that which the Apostle says: When he shall come in
flame of fire, to give revenge upon those which know not God. Because thou have
rejected knowledge: I also will reject thee. OSE. 4, 6. They said unto God:
Depart from us, we will not have the knowledge of thy ways. JOB. 21, 14. If
any man know not, he shall not be known. 1. COR. 14, 38. Be ye not made as
the horse and mule, in whom there is no understanding. PSALM. 31, 9. Cease not
my son to hear doctrine, neither be thou ignorant of the speeches of
knowledge. PRO. 19, 27 We must not think that ignorance will be a sufficient
excuse: for there will come a time, when even for our ignorance we shall be
punished, when not so much as our ignorance shall obtain pardon. CHRYSOSTOM. ho.
26. in ep. ad Romans The Preface to the Reader.
THe gloriouse Apostle Saint PETER very fittely compares the word of God, 2.
Pet. 1, 19.
and the doctrine of the Holy Ghost, unto a Candell shining in a dark place,
until the day dawne, and the day star arise in our hearts. For although
Christ our Savior the true light of the world, has by his most bitter
Passion and pretiouse wounds given light unto our darkness; yea, and of
darkness which we were before, made us a shining light: yet so long as we
remain in the mist of this mortality, and that it appears not what we shall
be: we are truly light in comparison of Heretics and Infidells: but in
respect of heaven; we are in the night, and continually converse in obscurity
and darkness. All honor then and glory be (as it is worthy) yielded unto him,
who least we walking in darkness know not whither to go, has provided us a
Candell of his holy doctrine even in the midst of Egypt, and set it upon a
candlestick in the Catholic Church: where those which are out of this house
of God living in palpable darkness; the children of this light may safely
expecte the rising of that star, wc never shall set, which is the clear
vision of Gods everlasting glory. This light although by diverse persons who
love darkness better than light, it has by sundry means been assaulted: yet
has these assaults done nothing e^se, but by increasing the adverse darkness,
made the light appear more gloriouse: and contrary to man's expectation, yet
agreeably to Gods disposition, not brought water to quench, but fuel to feed
so lively slames. Hence may we in all places of our Country to our own great
comfort, and Gods singular glory, out of Prisons, out of Judgments, out of
all manner of public places, out of many private persons and families, behold
the beams of this light so vehemently issuing forth; Mat. 24, 27.
that coming out of the East (for to use our Saviors words) it appears
even to the West: and it shines so generally abroad, that it is renowned in
the wholle world: which seeing the beauty thereof, glorifieth our Father of
light which is in heaven.

Only (my dear Catholic Brother) who being unlearned seek to tread the
steps of thy forefathers, and walking in darkness of this mortal life,
procurest to follow those which before thee have carried lights for thy
direction: it sometime comes into my mind to fear, least either thy
torchbearers being taken from thee, or for ouer-long watching, the oil of the
Lamp which they may leave thee (I mean charity and a good conscience 1. Tim.
1, 19.
the tinder and fuel of that light of Faith) beginning to fail; the light it
self may by little and little be extinguished: and so thou returning to thy
former darkness, together with the children of darkness, may fall and
perish. We are not ignorant of his cogitations, who like a roaring Lion goes
about seeking whom he may devour: and amongst other sleightes which he uses,
transfiguring himself into an Angel of light, with a counterfaite light of
hypocrisy and heresy; seeks to deprive thee of that which is true and sincere.

Wherefore I offer unto thee a torch or candell, containing in it, although in
a small match, the wh^ll light of Christian Religion, which although it be
lighted at the candel of another man: yet thou know, that light is never the
less because it is received of another: and in this it is more free from all
suspicion, whereas it is the same light which lighteneth many other parts of
the world. This when thou have once received, and fully enioied, thy self:
think that thou have not performed thy duty, if thou imparte it not to thy
children. O how they are deceived, and in how great danger of everlasting
damnation do they live, who as though they had by carnal generation brought
into this world brute beasts, whose only end is to live here, without any end
of heavenly bliss: do not seek for their children the means of their
salvation, only providing for them earthly riches, not caring for heavenly.
Nor considering, that besides the very bond of the law of nature, and of God
himself, who has given most strait charge of good education of children:
Christ our Savior has consecrated Christian marriages into a sacrament, for
this end amongst others; that they may present unto our Savior sanctified
children by baptism first, and afterward by all Christian and Catholic
discipline. Marriage was instituted to propagate the people of God, not to build
up the confused walls of Babylon. The Turk or Jew if he should perceive his
child to have been present at Christian Ceremonies, would not stick to embrew
his hands in that which he begotte. And yet he wc professes himself a
Catholic, by sending his child, or permitting his child to be sent to such
things as are indispensably forbidden by God himself: does unnaturally
deprive his innocent son of that which he could not give him. But true it is
which our Savior said: Luc 16, 8.
that wiser are the children of this world in their generation, than the
children of light. But thou dear Brother, when thou fallest into any such
preuarication, think assuredly that thy light is beecome darkness. And that in
darkness thou shalt so long remain, until thou take away the bushel with thou
have set before others eyes: and permit the light to shine to all those of
whom thou have charge.

But to the intent that thou may not only perform this duty, which is
necessarily and upon pain of utter darkness required of thee: but also like
unto a child of light seek that which is perfect, and according to the
nature of light liberally endeavor to communicate unto al me^ that which thou
have thy self of God received: I have set down in the margen of this book,
all those places of holy Fathers and Scriptures which are in the Lattin: to the
intent that thou either being assaulted by any adversary, or thy self seeking
to reschew out of miserable captivity any soul: may have authorities to
allege for whatsoever thou shall say. Of the places of scripture for the most
part I have quoted the very verse* that suddenly thou may find that wherein
consists the force of the proof.

Finally I have added certain little Kindled sizes, to lighten some secret
corners which might otherwise annoy thee. All which God grant that it may to
his glory both maintain and increase the light of thy heart, and bring forth in
many obscure minds such brightness of true belief, that we all may worthily
walk by the same, conforming our lives thereunto. That so being made worthy
unto the part of the love of the Saints, Col. 1, 13.
in the light; we may by him which has delivered us from the power of
darkness, be translated at the length into the everlasting Kingdom of the
son of his love: where we shall not only need neither sun nor moon: but
we shall receive that perfect light of the Lamb, by whom only as we have
been redeemed, so must we also be glorified.

The Printer to the Reader.
Whereas there is promised thee about the latter end of the book a Treatise
of service and scripture in the vulgar tongue: know thou that by reason of the
continual wars in this Country and the manifold difficulties which all
those that live here-about do feel: I have been constrained to finish this
work, without full accomplishment of my promise and purpose. But thou in the
mean time enjoy this my present which I make thee: and if I shall perceive
that this my labor is grateful unto thee: then shall thou in the next edition
receive a perfect recompense for this my defaulte. I have also set down a
Catalogue of the Fathers and Doctors wc are in this Book alleged, that thou
may see how ancient defendours we have of the Catholic truth: which in
deed neither could be Catholic if it had not antiquity with it: neither can
want antiquity if it be Catholic. So that in my judgment two principal
things thou shall find in this Book, of themselves sufficient to confirm
thy own Faith, and to confound the negative Religion of al adversaries. The
first is the very naked and sincere truth very plainly and expressly set down.
The second is the multitude of witnesses of her sincerity. For the innocence
of truth is such, that it presently commends it self unto the beholder and
discovers all malicious slanders; which when they grow unto most
intolerable impudency, cannot yet abide the force and majesty of so unspotted
testimonies, against which there cannot be taken any exception. This whereas I
my self have found in the perusing of this work, I could not but imparte
unto thee my mind and judgment. Farewell.

THE FIRST CHAPTER OF FAITH, AND OF THE CREED.
1 Who is to be called a Act. 11, 26. 1. Pet. 4, 16.
Christian?

HE which does profess the wholesome doctrine of Jesus Christ, true God and
man in his Athanas. contr. Arrianos. orat. 2. Cypr. lib. 4. ep. 2. and de simp.
praelat. Ignat. ad Magnes. Aug. tract. 113. in Ioa. and ser. 181. de temp. ca.
12. and Ench. cap. 5. Tert. lib. de praescript.
Church. He therefore which is a true Christian, does utterly condemn and
detest, all other Religions and Sects, that are elsewhere to be found in any
Nation, or country, out of the doctrine and Church of Christ, as the Iewishe,
Heathenishe, Turkishe, or heretical Sect. And does firmly stay himself in
the very Doctrine of Christ.

2 In what brief sum may Christian Doctrine be comprehended?

THat a Christian do know and observe those things which do belong both to
Ecli. 1, 3^
wisdom and Justice. Wisdom, as S. Austen Lib. 2. Retract. cap. 63. and
Ench. cap. 2. and 3.
shows, consists in the virtues Theological, 1. Cor. 13, 13.
Faith, Hope, and Charity, which are both infused by God, 1. Cor. 13, 13.
and being purely, and most fervently practiced in this life, they do make
men blessed and divine. Justice stands in Pros. sen. 98. ex Aug.
two parts, in declining from evil, and doing good. For hereu^to belongs that
which the kingly Prophet says. Psalm. 33, 15. and 36, 27 1. Pet. 3, 10.
Turn from evil, and do good. Now out of these fountains, to wit, Wisdom,
and Justice, other things are easily drawn and deduced, whatsoever do
appertain to Christian Instruction, To. 10, 14. Heb. 11, 6. Aug. sermon. 38. de
temp. and sermo 1. de verbis Apost. cap. 4. Leo. ser. 4. de not. Dom.
and Discipline.

3 What is first taught in Christian Doctrine.

FAith; that very gate and entrance to our salvation, without the which none in
this life can find, and call upon, serve and please almighty god. For, he that
comes to god must believe, He. 11, 6.
says the Apostle: And Mar. 16, 16.
he that believes not, shall be condemned, and is Io. 3, 18.
already Judged by the sentence of Christ.

4 What is understood by the name of Faith?

A Ephesians. 2, 8. Heb. 11, 1. Basil. ser. de fidei conf. Ber. ep. 190. Aug. cont.
ep. sund. c. 5.
gift of God, and a light wherewith man being illuminated, does firmly
assent and cleave unto those things which are revealed by God, and proposed
unto us by the Church to be believed. As are these that follow. That God is 1.
Io. 5, 7.
one in three persons, that the world was Genesis 1, 1. Io. 1, 14. Luc. 2, 7. Romans
3, 8.
created of nothing, that god was made man, and suffered death for our sakes,
that MARY Conc. Ephesians. cap. 13. Luc. 1, 35. 1. Cor. 15, 51. Io. 3, 5.
is both a Virgin, and the mother of God, that all the dead are to be raised
again to life, that man is borne again of Water and the holy Ghost, that
Christ is wholly in the Conc. Constantie. Flor. Trid.
B. Sacrament, and other such of like sort, that are the reverend mysteries of
our religion: which being revealed by God, cannot be comprehended by man's
Eccli. 3, 22. 2. Cor. 10, 5.
capacity, but may be conceived only by faith. Whereupon the Prophet says:
Esa. 7, 9. secundu^ 70. Basil. in Psa. 115. and in moral. Reg. 80. cap. 21.
Greg. ho. 26. in Euang. Chrysostom. in 1. ad Cor. homil. 4.
Unless ye will believe, ye shall not understand. For faith respects not
the order of nature, neither does she trust to experience of senses, or rely
upon the might or reason of man, but upon the power and authority of God,
holding this as a most undoubted verity, that the most sovereign and eternal
truth, which is God, ca^ neither deceive, nor ever be deceived.

Wherefore it is the very condition and property of faith, to bring all
understanding into 2. Cor. 10, 5.
captivity, unto the obedience of Christ, with whom there is no Lu. 1, 37.
Hier. 32, 27.
word that is hard to be done, much less impossible. This Eusebius. Emis. ho. 2.

faith is the light of the soul, the door or entrance to life, the foundation
of eternal salvation.

5 Is there any brief co^prehe^sion of Faith, and sum of all those things
that we must believe?

There is that which the twelve Apostles have delivered in their Creed, and
which they have aptely distinguished into twelve Sections and Articles. A work
doubtless worthy of such Clem. ep. 1. ad sr. Do. Amb. ep. 81. and sermon. 38.

authors, which next unto Christ our Lord, were the principal, and most holy
founders of the Christian faith. And this Creed surely is as it were a plain
and evident mark, whereby christians are to be distinguished and discerned
from those wicked persons, which do profess, either none at all, or not the
right faith of Christ.

6 Which be the Articles of this Creed?

I Believe in God the Father Almighty, maker of Heaven and earth.

2 And in JESUS CHRIST his only Son our Lord.

3 Which was conceived by the holy Ghost, borne of the VIRGIN MARY.

4 Suffered under PONTIVS PILATE, was crucified, dead, and buried.

5 He descended into hell, the third day he rose again from the dead.

6 He ascended into Heaven, and sits at the right hand of God the Father
Almighty.

7 From thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead.

8 I believe in the Holy Ghost.

9 The holy Catholic Church: the communion of Saints.

10 The forgiveness of sins.

11 The resurrection of the flesh.

12 And the life everlasting. Amen.

7 To what end specially are these words of the Creed?

TO this end surely, Hier. 9, 23. Io. 17, 3. 1. Cor. 2, 2. 1. Pet. 1, 8. cap.
13, 1.
that we may have comprehended in a brief sum, the true knowledge of god and
of heavenly things, which knowledge truly is necessary to every man that he may
live well and happily. And in this Creed the acknowledging and confessing of the
most holy Trinity, has the first and principal place, that it may in no wise
be doubted, but that God, than who^ nothing more mighty, Aug. l. 1. conf. cap.
4.
or better, or wiser can be imagined, is one and simple in essence, or divine
nature, but is distinguished into three Aug. l. de fid. and symb. cap. 9.
persons, so that before all things it be undoubtedly believed, that one is
the Mat. 28, 19. Athan. in symb.
Father, another is the Son, an other is the holy Ghost. The Father is he
which begets his Son Ps. 109, 3 Heb. 1, 2. 1 Io. 4, 10.14.
from al eternity: the fountain and framer of things. The Son being
begotten of the substance of the Father, is the Redeemer and Savior of the
world: The holy Ghost which is also called the Io. 15, 26. and. 16, 7. and
14, 16, 26.
Paraclet, is the governor of the Church, or of Christ's faithful people. Now
these 1. Io. 5, 7. 1. Tim. 1, 17 and 6, 15. Hier. 32, 17.
three are one: That is to say, one, True, Eternal, Infinite, and
incomprehensible God. Therefore to this most holy and indivisible Trinity,
three principal parts of the Creed do very fitly answer. To wit, the first;
of Creation: the second; of Redemption: Deuteronomy. 6, 4. Mat. 6, 9. 1. Tim. 1, 17
Genesis 1, 1. Esa. 53, 1. Job. 37, 3.23 Eccl. 3, 11. Luke 1, 37. Hier. 32, 17.
the third; of Sanctification.

8 What is the sense and meaning of the first Article of the Creed, I believe
in God the Father?

IT does first of all show us one God, and the first person in the godhead to
be the heavenly Father, eternal, and most sovereign in might and majesty, to
whom nothing is impossible, or hard to be done, who has al ^a. 16, 13. 1. Reg.
2, 6.
power of life, and of death.

This God the Father, begot the Son Psalm. 2, ^. Heb. 1, 2. Romans 8, 14.
from all eternity, and in this time of grace he made us also his children by
adoption. His power is so great, that with his only Ps. 32, 6. Col. 1, 16. Mat.
6, 26. Heb. 13, 5. 1. Tim. 4, 10 and 6, 15. To. 11, 36.
word he made as well visible, as invisible things of nothing, and being so
made does from time to time preserve and govern them with most high and
supreme goodness and wisdom, from whom, and to whom are al things. He is
the Iac. 1, 17. 2. Cor. 1, 3. Act. 14, 14.
Father of light, with whom there is no change or alteration, the Father of
mercies, and God of al consolation: finally such a one and so puissaunt, that
all things in heaven, in earth, and under the earth, do presently obey at his
Lu. 12, 5. Gen 17, 2. Psalm. 26, 1. and 90, 1. and 124, 1. Job. 41, 1. 1. Co.

beck: who being our guide and protector, we are preserved safe and
harmless, eue^ in the greatest evils and dangers.

9 What has the second Article, I believe in JESUS CHRIST?

IT does show the second person in Deity JESUS CHRIST very God and very man:
called surely by the name of JESUS; that is to say, the Savior of his people:
And CHRIST; to wit, anointed by the holy Ghost, and Io. 1, 14. Ap. 17, 14.
and 19, 16. Heb, 3, 1. and 5, 5. 1. Pet. 2, 25. Col. 1, 18. and 2, 9.
full of all grace and truth, our Messiah, King, and high Priest that holds
the principallity and sovereignty in all things, and in whom does corporally in
habit the whole fullness of the Godheade.

Furthermore it does show him to Ephesians. 1, 3. Io. 10, 36. Heb 1, 1. Ap. 1, 17.
Mat, 28, 18. Dan. 7, 2. Phil. 2, 6.
be the only Son of God, born of his Father, begotten before all worlds,
natural, consubstantial, and altogether equal unto him according to the
Godhead: Also our Lord, and Lord of al those that believe in him, as having
himself of his own accord delivered us when we were Luc. 15, 6.24. Romans 8, 1.
1. Cor. 6, 20. 1. Pet. 1, 19.
lost out of the bondage and thraledome of Satan, and most liberally redeemed
us being subject to the yoke of sin and damnation.

He also has dominion over the wicked: For all things are made subject under
his Ps. 8, 7. Romans 14, 9.
feet. But then he will openly show himself Lord of Ap. 19, 16. and 17, 14
Lords, and king of kings, both to the wicked, and to the Mat. 25, 30. 1. Cor.
15, 24. Ps. 109, 1.
whole world, when he shall bring in subjection al and every his enemies
whether they will or no, and shall burn them as chafe in Luc. 3, 17.22. Mat.

unquenchable fire. This is that beloved Son, this is our Emanuell, and
master who^ we must hear: neither is there any other name under heaven Act.

given unto me^, wherein we must be saved.

10 What is set before us to believe in the third Article, Conceived by the
holy Ghost? Mich. 5, 2. Ioh. 1, 1. and 16, 28. Esa. 53, 8. Io. 6, 39.46, 51.


IT does testify unto us that the same Lord that was begotten even from al
eternity of God the Father, without a Mother, for our sakes descended from
heaven and took upon him the Gal. 4, 4. Romans 1, 3. Mat.. 1, 18.20. Luc. 1, 26.
and 2, 1. Esa. 7, 1. Hier. 31, 22.
nature of man, in which he was temporally conceived in Nazareth, and in
Bethelem under the Emperor AUGUSTUS born without a Father, of the most pure
and undefiled Virgin, the power of the holy Ghost thus working in her, so that
(which exceeds all admiration) the word was made Conc. Ephesians. cap. 13.
flesh, and God became man, and MARY was both the mother of God, and a Hieron.
in Helu. Amb. ep. 81. Ezech. 44, 2.
Virgin.

This temporal conception, and generation of the Son of God, does contain
the Ioh. 3, 5. 1. Pet. 2, 1. and 3, 21. Heb. 2, 3. and 7, 25. Tit. 3, 5.
original of man's Salvation and Redemption, and it is the form of our
regeneration, whereby it comes to pass that we the cursed children of ADAM
being Job. 14, 4 Ephesians. 2, 3. Romans 6, 3. and 8, 1.12.
conceived of an unclean feed, and borne the children of wrath, are purified
and made clean: also that, of carnal we are made spiritual, and the very
sons of God in Christ, to whom the eternal Father would have the elect to
be made conformable, That he might be, as says To. 8, 29.
S. PAVL, the first borne in many breethren.

11 What does the fourth Article contain, suffered under PONTIVS PILATE.

IT shows that Christ when he had made an end of his most excellent
teaching and working of miracles, Act. 10, 37. Mat. 27, 50. Mar.. 15, 24. Esa.
50, 6. and 53, 1. Ioh. 1, 29. Heb. 7, 26. 1. Pet. 1, 19. and 2, 22. Ap. 1, 18.
1. Tim. 6, 13 Romans 5, 6. Ioa. 15, 13.
did at last acco^plishe his conflicte and agony for the Redemption of us that
were perished. Therefore although he were a most innocent and unspotted Lamb,
yea and God also immortal, yet to show his passing great charity toward us,
he suffered Io. 18, 4. and 19, 11. and 3, 14 and 12, 32. Mat. 27, 27. Mar. 15,
16. Luc. 23, 14. Io. 19, 16. Act. 13, 28.
willingly of most wicked persons all manner of extreme and bitter torments:
whereupon he neither eschewed the most unjust judgment of the wicked Judge
PILATE, nor yet the most shameful and Sap. 2, 12 Heb. 12, 2. Phil. 2, 8. Rom,
5, 6. Mat. 27, 60. Tit. 2, 14. Gal. 1, 4. Esa. 53, 12.
opprobrious punishment of the CROSS, undertaking a most cruel death for us,
and not refusing to be buried in an other man's monument: to the intent that
both living and dying he might give and employ himself wholly for the behoof
of mortal men. Which Passion of Christ, 1. Pet. 1, 18. 1. Io. 1, 7. Ap. 1, 5.
Ephesians. 1, 7.
Blood, Cross, Wounds, and Death, do continually yield comfort, health,
virtue, and life unto sinners, yet so that we obey, and To. 8, 17. 2. Cor. 1,
7. 2. Tim. 2, 11
suffer together with our Head, that so we may also be glorified with him.
For he being Heb. 5, 9.
consummate, was made to all that obey him, cause of eternal salvation.

12 What use and profit is there, in that we frame the Cross of Christ with
our fingers, and do sign our forehead there-withall.

THis Ceremony surely both the piety of men of Tert. cor. mil. cap. 3. Bas. de
spir. sa. cap. 27. Aug. de Catech. rud. ca. 20. and tra. in Io. 118. Naz. ogat.

ancient time passed, and the constant custom of the Church does commend unto
us. And first of all we are hereby stirred up to a thankful remembrance of
the most high mystery and benefit, which was for our sakes accomplished upon
the Cross, and most bountifully bestowed upon us.

Then we are provoked to fix and settel the true and holy glory, and the
Ancker of our salvation, in the Cross of our LORD.

Furthermore, this is a testimony, that we have no communication with the
enemies of Christ's Cross, JEWS, or HEATHENS, but do freely profess against
all such, him whom we serve, our Lord Jesus, and him crucified.

By this sign also we are moved to the study of Patience, that if we be
desirous of eternal glory (as surely we ought all to be) we do not think
much to embrace that Cross which we honor, and the way of the same Cross,
Mat. 16, 24. Luc. 9, 23. 1. Pet. 3, 14.17. and 2, 19.
with Christ our Captain.

Moreover, we fetch from hence victorious armor Atha. in vita Ant. Hieron. in
Hilarion. Ignat. ad Philip.
against Satan, long since subdued by the virtue of the Cross: yea and so we
are fensed against all the adversaries of our welfare.

Finally, that we may the more happily take any Ambros. sermon. 43.
thing in hand, and find more prosperous success in all our actions, we take
unto us this noble and triumphant ensign of the Cross; and expecting in this
sign to get Eusebius. li. 1. and 2. de vita Constan. Nice. l 8 c. 3. and l. 7 c.
47. et 49.
the victory, we do not doubt often times to say: In the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.

13 What would the fifth Article have us to believe, He descended into Hell,
Ps. 15, 10. Zach. 9, 11. 1. Pet. 3, 19. Col 2, 15. Eccli. 24, 45. Act. 2, 24.
Ose. 13, 14. Iren. l 5 c. 31 Aug ep. 99 and 57. quaes. 1 and l. 20. ciu. c. 15
and ser. 137. de te^p. Hier. in c 4. ad Ephesians. and in Ose. 13. Tert. l. 2. cont.
Mar. cap. 4. Mat 12, 29. Heb. 2, 14. Mar. 16, 9. Ap. 1, 5.18. Io 2, 19. Col. 1,
18. 1. Cor. 15, 8
and rose again?

IT teaches us that Christ, after he was dead upon the Cross, did penetrate
in Soul even down to Hell, that he might both show himself a conqueror of
death and the devil; and also a deliverer of the Fathers that were detained in
Limbo: but that according to his body, wherein he had lain in the Sepulcher,
the third day after, when it pleased him to return triumphantly from Hell, he
by his own power, arose again unto life, being immortal and glorious, and the
first borne of the dead. By which wonderful work, he does comfort and
instruct us, that the Elect are delivered out of the power of death, hell, and
the devil, and he does offer and commend unto all men, such grace and favor
of rising again, that those which believe truly in Christ, may rise from To.
6, 4. Col. 3, 1. Phil. 3, 20 Ephesians. 4, 22. 1. Pet. 1, 3.
vice to virtue, from the the death of sin, unto the life of grace, and
finally in the 1. Cor. 15, 22.
end of the world, from the death of the body to an immortal life. For he
which 2. Cor. 4, 14. 1. These. 4, 14
raised up JESUS, will raise up us also with JESUS.

14 What signifies the sixth Article, He ascended into Heaven?

Ps. 67, 19.33 and 46, 6. and 8, 2. Mar. 16, 19 Io. 3, 13. Act. 1, 1. Ephesians. 4,
8. and 12, 6. and 1, 20. Col. 3, 1. Heb. 1, 3 1. Pet. 2, 4. 1. Io. 2, 1. Io.
20, 17.
It shows that our Lord Jesus, after that he had finished the work of man's
Redemption, and appeared alive again unto his Disciples, and confirmed with
many arguments the truth of his Resurrection, at the last on the forty day
after, ascended into heaven, that according to his humane nature he might be
exalted above all things, and himself alone above all others, renowned and
honored of al men. Therefore our Lord JESUS Ps. 109, 8 Act. 7, 55. Luc. 22, 69.
1. Cor. 15, 25. Ephesians. 1, 20. Mat 28, 18.
sits in heaven on the right hand of the power of God, exercising equal
power with the father governing al things, and wholly shining with divine
Majesty; which is indeed Aug lib. de si. and sym. ca. 7.
to sit at the right hand of his Father. This joyful ascensio^ of Christ, is
the assurance of our faith and hope, so that whither the head has gone
before: (when once his enemies are vanquished:) thither the members also, so
that Heb. 5, 9. To. 8, 17. 2. Tim. 2, 11 Io. 15, 6.
they obey and cleave to their head, may have great hope to attain. Io. 14, 2.
I go (says he) to prepare you a place.

15 What does the seventh Article insinuate, From thence he shall come to Judge?
Ps. 6, 2. Esa. 3, 13. and 66, 15.


IT sets before our eyes the latter day of Judgment, when Christ shall
descend in humane flesh from the highest Heaven, Io. 5, 22.26. Soph. 1, 14.
Mal. 4, 1. Joel. 3, 1.
and shall sit in dreadful doom and judgment over the whole world, and in
the open face thereof, shall render unto every one according to his works.
Therefore Mat. 25, 31. et 24, 11 Luc. 21.25. Act. 1, 42. 1. These. 4, 15. et 5,
2. 1. Cor 15, 51. 2. These. 2, 1. 2. Pet. 3, 3.
in the seat and throne of his Majesty he shall judge al without exception,
good and bad, as well those that shall be alive when the day of judgment
shall come, as those that were before departed out of the world.

Whereby we are admonished, to live so much more warely and uprightly, by how
much more certainly we are persuaded, that all the actions, Mat. 12, 36 Sap. 1
8. Esa. 66, 18 Ec^^e. 12, 14 To. 2, 14. Ap. 20, 11. Basil. ep. ad Virg. lap.
thoughts, and designements of our life, are always apparent before the
presence of almighty God, that sees all things, and judges the^ most
righteously. For he is a righteous and just searcher of Hic. 17, 9. Heb. 4, 12.
Gal 6, 5. 1. These. 4, 6. Eccle. 12, 14 2 Cor. 5, 10 To. 14, 10.
hearts, and revenger of iniquities, before whose Tribunal we must all be
presented, that every one may receive at his hand accordingly as he has
behaved himself in his body, be it well, or evil. Who will neither Mat. 10, 40.
Job. 24, 12.
defraud any thing well done in this life, of dew reward, nor let any evil
deeds escape unpunished.

16 What is the sum of the Articles of the second person in Deity?

THis: Io. 1, 1.1^.34. 1. Ioa. 5, 20. Ephesians. 1, 7.
that Christ is true God and man, who began and brought to pass the
wonderful work of man's Redemption, so that, he is unto us the Io. 14, 6.
To. 5, 6. Apoc. 1, 5. 1. Tim. 2, 5. To. 3.24.
Way, Truth, and Life, by whom only when we had all perished, we were saved
and restored, and reconciled unto God the Father.

Of the benefit and true use of which Redemption, we find thus written: Tit.
2, 11
The grace of God our Savior has appeared to all men instructing us, that
denying impiety and worldly desires, we live soberly, justly, and godly in this
world, expecting the blessed hope and aduent of the glory of the great God, and
our Savior JESUS CHRIST, who gave himself for us that he might redeem us
from all iniquity, and might cleanse to himself a people acceptable, a pursuer
of good works. These be the words of the Apostle S. PAVL: and in Ephesians. 2, 10.
another place: We are the work of God, created in Christ Jesus in good
works, which God has prepared that we should walk in the^. And again, 2.
Cor. 5, 15.
Christ died for all: that they also which live, may not now live to
themselves, but to him that died for them and rose again.

Wherefore we must take diligent heed of the erroneous opinion of those, that
do confess Christ not wholly and perfitely, but as it were, lame and maimed,
whilst they do only acknowledge him as a 1. Tim. 2, 5. To. 3, 24.
Mediator and Redeemer, in whom we may trust: but do not withal admit him
for a Esa. 33, 22. Iac. 4, 12. Io. 13, 15.34. 1. Io. 2, 6. 1. Pet. 2, 21.
Lawe-maker, whose commandments we must obey; and a pattern of all virtue,
which we must imitate; and a just Judge, who surely is to repay the due

17 What does the eight Article teach us, I believe in the Holy Ghost?

IT specifieth the Holy Ghost, the third person in Deity; who proceeding from
the Father and the Son, is true God coeternall, coequal, and consubstantial
to both, and to be worshipped with the same faith, and with equal honor and
adoration.

This is that paraclet and teacher of truth, that does lighte^, purify, and
sanctify the hearts of believers, with his grace and gifts, and confirm them in all holiness. This is the Ephesians. 1, 13 To. 8, 26. 1 Cor. 12, 11
pledge of our enheritance, who helps our infirmity, and divides to every
one according as he will his diverse gifts.

18 What adds the ninth Article, I believe in the holy Catholic Curch?

IT does show and declare unto us the Church, that is to say, the Mat. 5, 15.
Esa. 6^, 1. and 2, 2. Psalm. 18, 5. Aug. tract. 1 in ep. Ioa. and de unit. Eccl.
c. 16. et in Ps. 30. Con. 2. Chrysostom. ho 4. de Verb. Esaiae.
visible congregation of Christ's faithful people, for which the Son of God
taking upon him the nature of man, did, and suffered all things.

And first it teaches that the same Church is Io. 11, 52. et 1^, 16 et 17, 11.
Cant. 6, 8 1. Cor. 1, 10 and 12, 12.25 Ephesians. 4, 3. Cypr. de s^p. praelat.

one, and vniformall in faith, and in the Doctrine of faith, and administration
of Sacraments, which, under one only head Christ Jesus, and one vicegerent

58. Le^. c. 89. ad Vien.
upon earth, the chief Bishop is governed and kept in unity.

Then, it gives us to understand, that she is holy. Ephesians. 5.27. Cant., 4 7.1.
Pet. 2, 9: Aug. E^ch. c. 56. et in Ps 85. Ber. ser. 3 in Vig. not. Greg. l. 35.

Because Christ does always sa^ctify her by the holy ghost, so that she is
n^uer destitute or void of holy men, and holy laws. Neither can any man be
partaker of any holiness and sanctification, that is not of her society and
congregation.

Thirdly, that she is Act. 1, 8. Genesis 22, 18. Mar. 16, 15.20. Luc. 24.47. Mat.
28, 19. and 16, 18. Aug. ep. 170 et 166. cont. ep. fund. c. 4 et lib. de

Catholic, that is to say, universal, so that, she being dispersed throughout
the world in her motherly bosom receaueth, embraces, and safe, keeps all
persons of al times, places and nations, so that they be of one mind and
consent in the faith and doctrine of Christ.

Fourthly, that there is in the same Church a communion of Saints, so that
those which live Ephesians. 4, 11.16. Psa 118, 63. Col. 1, 12. Phil. 1, 4. 2. Co. 8,
14. 1. Io. 1, 3. To. 12, 4. 1. Cor. 12, 4. Aug. Tr. 32. in Io.
in the Church, as the house and family of Almighty God, do hold an
inseperable society and unity amongste them selves, and as members of one and
the self same body, help and assist one an other, with mutual benefits,
merits, and prayers. Amongst the^ there is unity of faith, consent of
doctrine, conformable use of sacraments: and notwithstanding the disse^tions
and errors, what Euse. l. 7, cap. 19. Aug. 2. con. Do. c. 6. and ep. 19. and
de vera rel. c. 6.
ever they be, that by means of some few, may spring and grow up, yet are
they all ways careful, to Ephesians. 4, 3.
keep the unity of the Spirit in the band of peace. And in this Communion,
undoubtedly not only the Saints of the Church militant, that do traueyle as
pilgri^mes upon earth, but also all the blessed Saints of the Church most
happily triumphant with Christ in heaven, Aug. ser. 181. de te^p. cap. 13.
Euch. c. 56.
as also the souls of the godly, which having departed this life, are not Aug.
lib. 20. ciui. c. 9. Greg. l. 4. dial. cap. 39
yet come to that happy estate of the blessed Saints; Genesis 7, 23. 1 Pet. 3, 20
Esa. 60, 12 Aug. ^p. 50 and 152. and de unit Ec. c. 4. and 19. Full. de fid. ad

are al together, jointly comprehended.

Out of this communion of Saints, (like as out of the (k) Ark of Noah) there is
certainlye undoubted destruction, but no salvation for mortal men: not for the
Jews or Heathens, that never received the faith of the Church: not for
Haeritikes, that have forsaken the faith once received, or any way corrupted
the same: not for Schismatiks, that have divided the^ selves from the peace and
unity of the Church: finally, not for 1. Cor. 5 4. 1. Tim. 1, 20 Nu^. 12, 14.

REmission of sins, without the which, none can be just or obtain salvation.

IT declares the resurrection of the flesh, which at the latter day shall be
common to good and bad. For this frayl brickle body of ours that we bear about
with us, pestered with so many disseases, and subject to such continual
griefs and miseries, that must after our death become a pray for worms; shall
then revive: when at that last day, all the dead at the voice of Christ the
Judge shall be raised both to life and judgment. All therefore shall appear in
flesh before the 2. Cor. 5, 10. To. 14, 10.
tribunal of Christ, that every one without exception, accordingly as he has
behaved him self in his body, which the^ shall be restored unto him whole again,
so may receive either good or evil. And they that have done good things Io.
5, 29 Mat. 13, 40.
shall come forth into the Resurrection of life: but they that have done evil,
into the Resurrection of judgment, Mat. 25, 46. and 13, 10 Athan. in symb.
and punishment everlasting.

In the faith and belief hereof, a good and patient man does take solace and
comfort in the greatest miseries that may befall, so that at the very last
gasp of life, he will say, Job. 19, 25.
I know that my Redeemer does live, and in the last day I shall rise from
the earth, and again be compassed about with my skin, and in my flesh I
shall see God. Wise therefore certes and most wise are those that do bring

21 What is the last Article?

everlasting, which we may nothing doubt to remain unto the elect after
their death. And this is the fruit and final end of Faith, Hope, Patience,
and Christianlike exercise. For the obtaining of which life, to a true
believer, no work of piety ought to seem difficulte: no labor paynfull: no
grief bitter: no time long or taedious in well working or sufferinge. And if
this life notwith-standinge that it is repleate with all manner of calamities,
be accou^pted a thing most choice and delightful: how much more is that life
to be had in great price and aestimation which is Aug. de ciu. Dei. l. 22 c.

and l. 3 de symb. ad catech. c. 12
so far off from any feeling and fear of evil, and is replenished on every
side with heavenly and unspeakable joys, pleasures, and delights, that never
shall have end? Of which life Christ says thus: Luc. 12, 32.
Fear not little flock, for it has pleased your Father to give you a
Kingdom. And at the latter day of judgment he will say unto the elect:
Mat. 25, 34.
Come ye blessed of my father, possess you the kingdom prepared for you,
from the foundation of the world. But unto the wicked he will speak in this
manner: Get ye Ibid. 46.
away from me you cursed into fire everlasting, which was prepared for the
Devil and his Angels. Which sentence does not only touch Fulg. in lib. de
fide ad Pet. c. 38. and 40.
Heathens, Heretics, Schismatickes, and public sinners; but appertains
also to all those Christians, that do Ez. 18, 4. and 33, 8. To* 6, 23. Sap. 1,
16. 1. Cor. 6, 9.
end their lives in mortal sin.

Last of all this clause Hier. ad Mared. ep 137.
AMEN, is added in the end, that it may plainly appeeare, how firmly and
surely grounded, we stand in the profession and testimony of this Christian
Faith and Confession.

22 Is it sufficient for a Christian to believe those things only that are
contained in the Creed?

FIrst and specially, no doubt, Heb. 5, 12. and. 6, 1. 1. pet. 3, 15.
those things that are taught us in the Creed of the Apostles, are to be
believed, and openly Amb. l. 3 de Virg. Aug. l. 1 de symb. ad Cat. c. 1. and l.
2. cap. 1.
professed of every one. Which also are made more plain being conferred with
the Creed of the FATHERS, and with that of ATHANASIVS.

Secondly, a Christian must of necessity believe, whatsoever the 2. Pet. 1, 19.
To. 15, 4. 2. Tim. 3, 15
divine and Canonical Scripture does contain. But the certain and Conc. Tol.

legitimate books of Scripture, no man may discern by any other means, than
by the judgment and authority of the Church.

Thirdly, hereunto do belong those things that are necessarily drawn Mat.
22, 29.
and deduced, partly out of the Articles of the Creed, and partly out of holy
Scriptures.

Fourthly and lastly, are all such documents to be holden as most holy, and to
be firmly believed, which the holy ghost reuealeth unto us, and pronounces by
the Cypr. ep. 10. ad Nest. Iren. l. 3. cap. 4. and. li. 4. c. 45. and 63. Hier.

Church, whether they be commended unto us by writing, or delivered by
tradition and word of mouth. Which point we will touch more at large hereafter.

These therefore are the things, in which the true catholic faith does
consist, without the I^eo. ser. 4. de natiu. Dom.
which al sectaries do in vain promise to themselves and others, grace, and
salvation in christ.

AND OUR LORDS PRAYER.
1 What is Hope?

HOpe is a virtue infused by God, whereby we do with assured trust and
confidence, expect at Gods hand the good of our salvation and life everlasting.

To small purpose it is to believe in God, and the word of God, and to profess
the divine Doctrine of holy Church: unless a Christian having once
understood the goodness of Almighty God, do conceive hope and confidence of
obtaining grace and aeternall salvation. Which hope does so fortify and uphold
the just man in the greatest Eccli. 34, 15. Romans 8, 35. Psalm. 30, 25. Prou. 28,
1.
miseries, that although he be destitute of all wordly helps: yet will he
confidently say: Job. 13, 15.
Al-though he kill me yet will I hope in him. And ps. 55, 5.
in God I have hoped, I will not fear what flesh may do unto me. Ps. 24, 2.
My God I trust in thee, I will not be ashamed.

2 By what means may a man come to have this hope?

FIrst of al one great help heerunto, is to 1. These. 5, 16. Luc. 11, 9. and
18, 1. Mat. 7, 7. Eccli. 18, 22.
pray fervently and often to almighty God. Also hope is to be nourished and
stirred up with daily meditation of the goodness and benefits Ephesians. 2, 4. Tit.
3, 3. To. 8, 29. Io. 3, 16. 1. Co. 4, 9. Heb. 10, 23. Tit. 1, 2. To. 5,
8.17.20. and 8, 18.
of God, those especially, which Christ our Lord for his infinite charity
toward us, performed and promised even to the undeserving. Last of all, there
must be annexed Pro. 15.15. 1. Io. ^, 21. Aug. l. 1. de doc. Chr. c. 37. and
40. and l. 3. c. 10. and in praef. Ps. 31.
purity and cleannes of conscience, which must ever 2. Cor. 1, 7. Heb. 3, 6.
and 10, 34. 1. Io. 3, 3. Col. 1, 21. 2. Pet. 1, 10.
show it self by good works, and invincible patience in all aduersitye. For
they that want the testimony of a good conscience, or have not a purpose to
amend their life, they I say, have not that hope which they should, but do
rather rashly vaunt of 2. Pet. 2, 18. Eccli. 5, 4.6. Greg. 33. mor. c. 15.
praesumption, and a very vain and unfruitful confidence, how-soeuer they
boaste of Gods grace and of the merits of Christ.

Hope in our Lord says the Ps. 36, 3.
Prophet, and do goodness, and again: Be thou subject to our Lord, and pray
to him. And an other Prophet: Thren. 3, 25.
Our Lord is good to those that hope in him, to the soul that seeks him. And
that this hope must not be al-together Greg. l. 6. ep. 22. ad Gregoria^. Ber.
de Fest. Magdal.
void of fear, it appears by this place of the psalm: Our Lord Ps. 146.11.
is well pleased over the^ that fear him, and in the^ that hope and trust in
his mercy.

3 What good things are those which a Christian must hope for?

FIrst, and specially those good Tit. 2, 13. and 3, 7.
things of the Kingdom of heaven, which do make men blessed and happy, and
exempteth them from all manner of misery. Then, all such things as Heb. 4, 16,
Aug. in Enc. cap. 114.
serving for the necessary uses of mortal men in this life, are rightly
desired and prayed for at Gods hands, ought to be reputed in the number of
those good things which are to be hoped for and expected. All which are
specially expressed in our Lords prayer, as which Christ our Lord with his
own most sacred Mat. 6, 9. Luc. 11, 2.
mouth delivered, and with wonderful wisdom prescribed to all those, that
would gladly by prayer lay open their hope and good desires befote All. God.

into temptation. 7 But deliver us from evil. Amen.
5 What is the su^me of our Lords prayer?

THere are Aug. in Ench. c. 115 and. l. 2. de ser. Dom. c. 10.
seven petitions therein contained, unto which, all manners and forms of
prayers Aug. ep. 121. ad Probam. c. 12.
what-soeuer may and ought to be referred, whether we treat with al-mightie
God, for the obtaining of some good things: or for the wiping away of sin: or
for the turning away of any evil whatsoever. And in the three first petitions,
those things are in order demanded, which are properly aeternal and
everlasting: in the four others we do ask even temporal things, as being
necessary for us, to the getting of the aeternal.

6 What is meant by the beginning of this prayer, Our father which art, etc.

Ex. 15, 11. Esa. 42, 5. and 63, 15. Mal. 1, 6. 2. Cor. 1, 3. Phil. 4, 20. Ap.
4, 10. To. 8, 15. Gal. 4, 5. 1. Pet. 3, 22. Leo. ser. 6. not. Do.
IT is a little preface, and it puts us in mind of that great and
inaestimable benefit, whereby God the Father, that eternal majesty, reigning
most happily in heaven, received us into his favor, and for Christ his Sons
sake, adopted us by the holy Ghost to be his sons, and heirs unto his
heavenly Kingdom.

And this remembrance of so great benefits, does not only stir up Cypr. in
ser. de or. do
attentio^: but provoke also the sons to render love again to their father
and to obey him, and it does in like manner encourage the^ to pray, and afford
the^ Luc. 11, 11. Iac. 1, 6.
confidence to obtain.

7 What is the sense of the first Petition, Hallowed be thy name?

WE desire that as well in our selves as in all others, Mat. 5, 17. 1. Pet. 2,
12. and 4, 11. 1. Cor. 10, 31. Col. 3, 17. To. 15, 6. Eccli. 36, 1.
that may always be preferred and advanced, which stands most with the glory
and honor of our Sovereign and most excellent Father.

And this indeed we do perform, when the confession of the true faith, hope
and charity, and holy couersation Luc. 1, 72. 1. Pet. 1, 15. and 3, 16. Phil.
2, 15.
of Christian life, do show forth their light and force in us, that Mat. 5. 17.
others also beholding the same, may take occasion to glorify our Father.

8 What is contained in the second Petition, Thy kingdom come?

WE do ask that God by his grace and justice, Mat. 6, 33. To. 14, 17. Ps. 22,
1. and 79, 2. Luc. 1, 33. and 17, 20. 1. Cor. 3, 16 and 4, 20. Ephesians. 1, 18.23.
Mat. 13, 41 1. Co. 15, 24 Col. 1.13. Ps. 67, 2.
may reign in his Church, yea, and in the whole world all adversary powers, and
evil affections being once abandoned and rooted out.

Then we do wish and pray, that being once called out of this world, as out of
a troublesome Phil. 1, 23. Heb. 11, 13. 1. Pet. 2, 11. Job. 7, 1. 2. Cor 5, 6.
Sap. 5, 16. Apoc. 22, 4. Mat. 8, 11.
pilgrimage and warfare, we may be speedily transported into the kingdom of
glory, and everlasting felicity, to reign with Christ and his Saints for ever.

9 What imports the third Petition, Thy will be done?

WE do wish in this petition, Ps. 102, 20. To. 1, 10. Act. 9, 6. and 21, 14.
Deuteronomy. 12, 8 Heb. 13, 21. I^c. 4, 15. Luc. 22, 42. 1. Pet. 4, 2, Act. 5, 29.
Job. 1, 21. 1. Pet. 5, 6.
that as the Angels and blessed Saints in heaven; so we also upon earth, though
weak, and of small force, may exhibit unto Almighty God, exact obedience,
desiring or coveting nothing so much as that we may willingly submit our selves
to the will of God, both in prosperity and adversity, and renouncing our own
will, which is prone Genesis 8, 21. Mat. 26, 41 Bern. ser. 3. de resur.
unto evil, we may rest and settle our minds in the Io. 4, 34 and 5, 30. and
6, 38. 1. Reg. 3, 18.
will of God.

10 What has the fourth Petition, Give us this day our daily bread?

WE do like poor folks, and beggars, crave of the author and fountain of
al goodness, Iac. 1, 5.17. Psalm. 39, 18. Deuteronomy. 10, 18 Genesis 28, 20. 1 Timothy 6,
8. Pro. 30, 8. Ps. 144, 15.
those things that be sufficient for the daily maintenance of our corporal
life, to wit, food, and clothing, also those things that do serve to a
better the life of the soul: as the Mat. 4, 4. Am. 8, 11. Eccli. 15, 3. Pro.
9, 5.
word of God, the spiritual food of the soul; the most holy Mat. 26.26. and 6,
11 Io. 6, 51. Hier. in c. 6. Mat. Cypr. in ser. de cr. Do. Amb. l. 5. de Sacr.
c. 4. Aug. l. 2. de ser. Do. in mont. c. 7. Thren. 4, 8. 1. Cor. 10, 6 Leu. 26,
14. Number. 5, 6. 20. Exo. 32, 27. Luc. 7, 47. Tob. 12, 10. Sap. 16, 14. Ps. 50,
3.4.9.11.
and B. Sacrament of the Altar, that heavenly bread: and other most wholesome
Sacraments and gifts of God, which do feed, cure, and confirm the inward
man to a well ordered and happy kind of life.

11 How is the fifth Petition understood, Forgive us our trespasses?

IN this we crave, that God will mercifully purge us from the spot of sin,
which above all things is most foul and pestilent unto the soul; and that he
will also remitte those very debts, which we have contracted by sinning.

And least our prayer should not be available, by reason that we are evil
affected toward our neighbor; we add this besides, that all secret hate and
To. 12, 17.19. Col. 3, 12. Luc. 23, 34. Act. 7, 60 Mar. 11, 25. Ephesians. 4, 32.
desire of revenge being laid aside, we are at atonement with our neighbor,
and have forgiven every one that has offended us, even from the bottom of our
hearts. For this is that which Christ signified in an other place when he
said: Lu. 6, 37.
Forgive, and ye shall be forgiven. And again: Mat. 6, 14. and 18, 22 33.
Eccli. 22, 1. Aug. in Enc cap. 74.
If you will not forgive men, neither will your Father forgive you your
offenses.

12 What is the sense of the sixth Petition, Lead us not into temptation?

BEcause this present life is a very warfare upon earth, Job. 7, 1. Judith. 8,
2^ Tob. 3, 21. and 12, 13. Mat. 4, 1. and 26, 41. Heb. 2, 18. 2. These. 3, 3. 1.
Io. 2, 14, 16. and 5, 4. Mat. 16, 24. 1 Cor. 9, 25.27. and 10, 12. Iac. 4, 4.
and 1, 12. 1. Pet. 5, 8.10 2. Pet. 2, 9. Ephesians. 6, 11. Col. 3, 5. Apoc. 2,
7.10.11.17.26 2. Tim. 4, 7.
whilst we are al-waies assaulted with diverse temptations, and in an hard and
continual conflict, with the world, the flesh, and the devil: therefore, being
devoutly careful of our own estate, we sue for help at the hands of
almighty God, that we do not yield to such assaults of our adversaries, and
by yielding incurr damnation; but that standing al-waies in this continual
combat, relieng upon the might and hand of God, we may valiantly resist the
power of the devil, have the world in contempt, chastise the flesh, and so
finallye as invincible soldiers of Christ, be crowned after the victory, for
2. Tim. 2, 3.
no man is crowned, as witnesses the Apostle, unless he strive lawfully.

13 What is in the seventh and last petition, deliver us from evil?

WE pray at the last, that God will not suffer us to be ouer-throwne, ^. Reg.
8, 33. Pro. 10, 25.28.30. Eccli. 23.4. Hier. 2, 14. Tob. 1, 22. and 2, 10.
Eccli. 27, 1.4.6. Ap. 3, 10. Ps. 24, 15. and 30, 3.5.8.9.16. and 33, 5.7.8.18.
and cast away with the wicked, by the calamities of this world, wherewith even
the Godly also are exercised: but that by his benignitye he deliver us, so
far forth as is expedient for our salvation: and mercifully defend us from
all evil both of body, and of soul, as well in this life, as in the life to
come. For so has himself promised: Ps. 49, 15
Call upon me in the day of tribulation, I will deliver thee and thou shall
honor me.

Last of al, we conclude the whole prayer with this one word Amen, 2. Cor. 1,
20 Amb. in Ps. 40. Hier. in. c. 6. Mat.
that we may show our confidence in praieng, and hope of obtaining, in regard
as well of Christ's promise that never fails, Mat. 7, 7. Luc. 11, 9. Io. 16,
23.
Ask, (says he) and it shall be given you: as also of the infinite clemencye
and ready mercy of God the Father: in so much that hereupon, S. IHON has
said, 1. Io. 5, 14.
What-soeuer we shall ask according to his will, he hears us.

14 What is the sum of our Lords prayer?

IT containethe a perfect and absolute form not only of asking that which is
good, but also of praieng to be delivered from whatsoever is evil.

And amongst the things that be good, this is first to be wished and prayed
for, that all men may glorify our heavenly Father, at all times and in all
places: then, that we may be partakers of his Kingdom: afterward, that we may
not want those helps that are convenient for the attaining unto the same
Kingdom. As is, on the behalf of our soul, to be conformable to the will of
God: and as touching our body, to have necessary living and maintenance.

But those things that are added in the second place, and do continue to the
end of the prayer, do express the affect of one that craves delivery from
evils, which by the grace and power of almighty God he desires to have either
utterly taken away, to wit sin the contagion of all goodness and the sink
and puddle of all evils: or else that they may be so tempered, that by their
violence, they hinder us not in the way to salvation. Such are, diverse
temptations that invade us in this world, and all calamities both present and
to come. Al other things that are to be said touching prayer, shall be reserved
for that place, where the three kinds of good works shall be expownded.

OF THE ANGELICAL SALVTATION.
15 Which is commonly called the Angelical salutation?

THat which was pronounced unto the most holy Virgin, Luc. 1, 28. Chrysostom. and

the mother of God in these words: Hail MARY full of grace, our Lord is with
thee; blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb,
JESUS. Holy MARIE mother of God, pray for us sinners now and in the hour of
our death. AMEN.

16 Whereupon came this manner of saluting the mother of God?

FIrst of the words and examples of the Gospel, whereas the great Archangell
GABRIELL and ELISABETH the holy mother of the Luc. 1, 28, 42.
forerunner of our Lord, both inspired by the holy Ghost, do so teach and
instruct us.

The^ we have this form of salutation confirmed and ratified, by the
continual custom and consent of the Church, which the holy ancient Damasc in
Cant. de annunc. Ath. in Euang. de SS. Deipara. and many more as appears in
the 18. and 19. sections.
Fathers and men of old time have religiously observed, even to this day, and
would have also of us to be observed.

17 What does it profit us to use this manner of salutation?

BY these excelent words, we are first of al admonished of that exceeding
great benefit, that the eternal Father would Gal. 4, 4.
begin in Christ, by MARIE the mother of God, and mercifully bestow upon
mankind by redeeming it.

Luc. 11, 27. et 1, 30.
This is also a singular commendation of the most holy and wonderful Virgin,
which God has determined to be the finder of grace and mother of life unto us
all.

Wherefore no marvel, if after those Godly petitions, which we offered unto
god in our Lords prayer; being here mindful of the grace that we received by
Christ, we do not only praise the mother of Christ but also God the Father in
the same Virgin mother of God, and reioiceing together with the Angels, with
great reverence, and often salute her.

18 What is the sense of this salutation? Andr. Hieros. Archie. Cretensis. in
salut. Ang^l. Iren, l. 3. c. 31. and 33. Hier. ad Eusto. ep. 22. c. 8. and 9.

IN the first words thereof, we do justly rejoice with, and in reioicing
praise and renown her, that was to us the second and that a most happy EVE.
For, that woe of malediction that the first EVE brought into the world, this
other by her wholesome fruit has taken away, and has exchanged the very curse
of the children of ADAM with a perpetual blessing.

Most worthy no doubt to be called full of grace, as who being full of God, Amb.
in c. 1 Luc. Ber. ser. 9. ex paruis.
full of virtues: alone (for I will use S. AMBROSE his words) obtained that
grace which no other had ever deserved before, that she might be replenished
with the Author of grace. And what place could there be in her soul or body
for any vice, when she was made the temple of the holy of all holies?

There is added besides: Our Lord is with thee. because both the power of the
Father did singularly ouershadowe Luc. 1, 35.
her: and the holy Ghost came plentifully upon her: and the Io. 1, 14. Ps. 18,
6.
word being made flesh, from her did proceed in most wonderful wise, as a
bridegroom from his chamber.

Then it follows, Blessed art thou among women. Because she was together a
spouse by Esa 7, 14. Ez. 44, 2.
Virginity and a mother by fruitefulnesse. And therefore with great right all
generations do, and shall al-waies call her Luc. ^, 48

after her delivery: always Amb. ep. 81. Hier. in Helu and in Apol. aduer. Iouin

Trid. Sess. 5. et Ses. 6. cap. 23.
exalted above all heavens: who no less by giving life was profitable, than
unhappy EVE by killing was hurtful unto all mankind.

And blessed is the fruit of thy womb, JESUS: as he that springing up like a
Esa. 11, 1.
flower from MARIE the root, has both showed himself after a sort fruit
of the earth: and does in such manner yield the fruit of life and salvation to
his members, as Io. 15, 5.
a Vine does juice and life unto the branches. O blessed womb Luc. 11, 27.
indeed that bare and brought forth a Savior to the world: O blessed
pappes without doubt, that being filled from heaven, suckeled the Son of God.

Finally the Church has added in the end; Antiquu^ Breuiarium and nouum.
Holy MARIE mother of God, pray for us sinners, now, and in the hour of our
death. For we following the Ephrem. de laud. Mar. and in orat. ad eandem and in

steps of the holy Fathers, do not only salute that wonderful Virgin,
worthy of all commendation, which is as a Lilly Can. 2, 1
amongst thorns: but do also believe and profess that she is endowed with so
great power and ability from God, that she is able to profit, favor, and
pleasure miserable mortal men, especially when they do commend themselves,
and their desires unto her, and do humblely sue for the grace of God, by the
Mothers intercession.

19 Testimonies of the Fathers touching the Virgin MARY.

Lib. 5, ca. 19.
IRENEVS: As EVE was seduced to swerve from Almighty God: so MARY was persuaded
to obaie God; so that MARY a Virgin was made the advocate of EVE a Virgin: and
as mankind was made subject to death by a Virgin, so it is loosened by a
Virgin: a Virgins disobedience, being counterpeazed by a Virgins obedience.

Saint CHRYSOSTOM: In Liturgia.
It is very meet and just, to glorify thee the mother of our God, ever most
blessed, and al-together undefiled, more honorable tha^ the Cherubins and more
glorious incomparablely, than the Seraphins, which without all corruption have
brought forth God. we do magnify thee, the very mother of god. Hail Mary full
of grace, our Lord is with thee, blessed art thou among women, and blessed is
the fruit of thy womb; because thou have brought forth the Savior of our
souls.

S. AMBROSE: Li. 2. de Vir.
Let the Virginity and life of blessed MARY be set forth unto us as it were
in an image; from whom, as from a glass, there shines out bright the beauty
of chastity and fairness of virtue. What is more noble than the mother of
God? What is more bright, tha^ she who^ brightness did choose? What is more
chaste, than she that brought forth a body without contagion of the body? Such
a one was MARY, that her only life might be a document to all men.

In Euang. de Sancta nostra Deipara.
Saint ATHANASIVS: Forasmuch as he is a king that was borne of the Virgin, and
the same also Lord and God: for that cause, she that bare him is truly and
properly judged to be a Queen, and a Lady, and the mother of God. This new
EVE is called the mother of life, and she remains replenished with the first
fruits of immortal life above all living creatures. We do call her therefore
again and again, and evermore, and every way most blessed. To thee we cry,
be mindful of us, O most holy Virgin, which even after thy delivery
remainedst a Virgin. Hail MARY full of grace, our Lord is with thee: The holy
orders of all Angels, and men do call thee blessed. Blessed art thou among
women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb: make intercession for us O
Mistres, and Lady, and Queen, and mother of God.

Ser. de laud. Mariae.
FVLGENTIVS: MARY was made the window of heaven; because by her, god gave the
true light unto the world. MARY was made the ladder of heaven; because by her
God descended down to earth, that by her also men may ascend unto heaven. MARY
was made the restorer of women, because by her they are known to be exempted
from the ruin of the first curse.

was given unto us.

THE THIRD CHAPTER OF CHARITY, AND THE TEN COMMAVNDEMENTS.
1 Is it sufficient for a Christian to be instructed in the doctrine of faith
and hope?

IT is very necessary that he which has attained unto Faith and Hope, be
endued with Charity also. For of these three virtues, Saint PAVL teaches
jointly thus: Now there 1. Cor. 13, 13.
remains, says he, Faith, Hope, Charity, these three, but the greater of
these is Charity.

Great undoubtedly is faith, which may 1. Cor. 13, 2. Mat. 11, 23. Mat. 7, 22.
suffice to move mountains, and work miracles: Great also is Hope, a certain
1. These. 5, 8. Ephesians. 6, 17. Heb. 6, 19.
helmet, and Ancour of salvation, which setting before us the goodness of God,
and the greatness of reward, does afforde both effectual comfort to them that
labor, and a singular confidence to them that pray. But greatest of all is
Charity, the Prosp. l. 3 de vita co^t. ca. 13 and, 15. Aug. in Ps. 47. and
tract. 5. ep. Io. and e^ch. c. 117. and ser. 53. de temp.
Prince of all virtues, which knows neither measure nor end, nor forsakes
them that die, being stronger than death it self, without which in a Christian
there may be indeed both Faith, and Hope; but Aug 15. de Trin. c. 18
they cannot be sufficient to the leading of a good and happy life. For which
cause S. JOHN says: He 1. Io. 3, 14
that does not love, abides in death, although in the mean season he believe
and hope, as the example of the foolish Virgins in the Gospel Mat. 25, 11.
Aug. ser. 23. de verb. do. c. 4. and 8. Mat. 22, 36. ^uc. 10, 27. Mar. 12, 30.
Aug. lib. 3. doc. cap. 10.
does plainly declare unto us.

2 What then is Charity?

A Virtue infused by God, by which God is syncerely loved for himself, and our
neighbor for Gods sake.

For God is chiefly to be loved in all things, Bern. de dilig. Deo.
and above al things, and for himself alone, as alone being the most
sovereign, and eternal good, which only satisfies our minds: whose love,
and 1. Cor. 10, 31. Col. 3, 17.
honor, ought to be the beginning and final end both of our will, and of al
our works. Then for Aug. ho. 38 ex 50. ca. 2. and seq.
Gods sake must we love our neighbor, that is to say, Aug. in Ps. 118.
concione 8. and ser. 53. and 59. de temp.
every man without exception. For as much as we be al neighbors amongst our
selves, and linked together with a great affinity, both in regard of the same
humane nature, common to all the ehildren of ADAM, and also by reason of Gods
grace and everlasting glory, whereof all that will, may be partakers.

3 How many precepts of Charity be there?

IN substance two; whereof the first of loving God, is thus propounded in the
old and new Law. Thou Deuteronomy. 6, 4 Mat. 22, 36. Mar. 12, 30. Luc. 10, 27. Greg.
lib. 10. mor. c. 6. and 7
shall love the Lord thy God, from thy whole heart, and with thy whole soul,
and with thy whole mind, and with all thy strength. This is the greatest and
the first Commandment. And the second is like to this, thou shall love thy
neighbor as thy self. On these two commandments depends the whole Law and
the Prophets.

This Charity is the Romans 13, 11.
fullness of the Law, and sum of Justice, that is to say, the Col. 3, 14.
band of perfection. Charity, I say from a 1. Tim. 1, 5.
pure heart, and a good conscience, and a faith not fained.

4 How does true Charity show it self?

THe proof of Greg. ho. 30. in Eua^g.
love and Charity, is to perform the same in deeds, and to observe Gods
Commandments. Whoreupon Saint JOHN also the beloved of Christ, says. 1. Io.
5, 3.
This is the charity of God, that we keep his Commandments; and his
Commandments are not heavy. And again. 1. Io. 2, 4.
He that says he knows God, and keeps not his Commandments: is a liar
and the truth is not in him. But he that keeps his word, in him in very deed
the charity of God is perfited. In this we know that we be in him.

And Christ himself also teaches: If you Io. 14, 15
love me keep my Commandments. He that has my Commandments and keeps
them: he it is that loves me. And he that loves me shall be loved of my
Father: and I will love him, and will manifest my self unto him. The
Commandments are thus distinguished by S. Aug. 9.71. in Exo. et ep. 119. c.
11. Clemens Alexan. l. 6. strom. comment. Hier. in Ps. 32. Ex. 20, 1. and 34,
28. Levi. 19, 1.37. Deuteronomy. 4, 13. and 5, 6. and 10, 4.
He that loves me not, keeps not my words.

5 Which are the Commandments of God specially belonging to Charity?

THE ten words of God, first delivered by MOSES to the Jews, and afterward
commended by Christ and his Apostles to Mat. 19, 17. and 5, 18. and 22, 37.
Mar. 10, 19. and 12, 31. Luc. 18, 19. and 10, 25. To. 2, 13. and 13, 8. and 7,
12 Gal. 5, 14. Jac. 2, 8. and 1, 25. and 4, 11. 1. Tim. 1, 5. Co^. Tri. sess.
6. c. 19.20, 21
all Christians, which are commonly called the Decalogue, or the ten
Commandments, and are thus set down. I am thy Lord God.

1 Thou shall not have any strange gods before me. Thou shall not make to thy
self any graue^ thing Le. 26, 1. The co^ma^dements are expounded by Orig. ho*
8. in Exodus Aug. quaest. 71. in Ex. and tract. de 10. plagis. and lib. de 10.
chord.
to worship it. 2 Thou shall not take the name of thy Lord God in vain. 3
Remember thou keep holy the Sabbath day. 4 Honor thy Father and thy Mother,
that thou may live long in the land which thy Lord God will give thee. 5
Thou shall not kill. 6 Thou shall not commit aduoutry. 7 Thou shall not steal.
8 Thou shall not bear false witness against thy neighbor. 9 Thou shall not
Deuteronomy. 5^.21.
covet thy neighbors wife. 10 Thou shall not covet his house, nor his field,
nor his servant, nor his handmaid, nor his Ox, nor his Ass, nor any thing
that is his.
6 What means this beginning, I am thy Lord God?

Almighty God begins the ten Commandments with the knowledge of
himself, Deuteronomy. 6, 1.15.24. and 4, 23.40. and 10, 16. Mal. 1, 5.14. Hier. 32,
17. Psalm. 46, 3.
and with the insinuation of his Majesty. That the Lawmakers being once known,
we may fear and reverence him the more, and the Commandments which he has
set down may be of greater authority amongst al men. For we are so seriously
dealt withal, that if ever we mean to be Mat. 4.18. and 19, 17 and 28, 20.
Heb. 5, 9. Ps. 118, 1.4.1. Io. 3, 24. Aug. quaest. 140. sup. Ex.
saved, we must first as in a most bright glass, here assuredly behold the will
of the divine Majesty, and the whole and perfect manner of living well, and
then this most holy Law being once known by the To. 8, 26. Joan. 1, 17. Phil,
4, 13.
help of Christ's spirit exactly keep and observe the same.

Neither truly does our Lawemaker only give Commandments, but does withal
promise his Ps. 83, 8. Deuteronomy. 28, 1. Leuit. 26, 3.
blessing, and assisteth with his helping hand. I will put says he my Ezec.
36, 27. and 11, 19.20.
spirit in the midst of you, and I will cause that you may walk in my
Commandments, and that you may keep my judgments, and that you may work.
For which cause when Christ also Mat. 11, 28.30. 1. Joan. 5, 3. Conc. Trid.
sess. 6. ca. 11. and Can. 18. Chrysostom. l. 1. de com. cor. Bas. q. 176. in reg.
breu. Aug de not. and gra. c. 43. and 69. and ser. 61. and 191. de temp. Hier.
in sym. ad Damas.
had commanded: Take up my yoke upon you; least any man should aleadge the
difficulty thereof as an excuse: he added. For my yoke is sweet, and my
burden light: Unto those undoubtedly, that being endued with the spirit of
grace, do walk in charity not fained.

7 What imports the first Commandment?

IT forbids and condemns Idolatry, Deuteronomy, 12, 2. and 4, 15. and 18, 19. 1.
Reg. 28, 3. Psa. 113, 12. Leui. 19, 26.31. and 20, 6.27. Eccli. 34, 4.
Superstitious observations, and the use of Arte-Magicke and divination.

It teaches also and requires, that we account Aug. lib. 10. ciuit. c. 1.
and ep. 49, q. 3
no creature at all for God, though it be never so excellent: but that we
believe and confess one only true, eternal, and infinite God, and that to him
only we offer Sacrifice, and give that singular Aug. l. 10 ciu. c. 1. and 4.
and l. 15. con. Faust. c. 9. and l. 20. cap. 21.
and sovereign honor which the GRAECIANS call Latria.

And by means hereof it comes to pass, that above Io. 4, 23. Romans 10, 11
1. Joan. 4, 8. Mat. 4, 10. Luc. 4, 8. Esa. 43, 1. 1. Tim. 6, 13
all things we honor, call upon, and adore that sovereign and eternal good,
the most excellent, mighty, Maker, Redeemer, Savior, one immortal God, who
To. 9, 5. Psalm. 83, 12.
is blessed above all things, the giver of all grace and glory.

8 How, and in what sort do we besides Almighty God, honor and call upon the
Saints also?

OF Saints, to wit, of all those that are sanctified and borne again in
Christ, our meaning is not to speak in this place, as S. PAVL To. 1, 7. 2.
Cor. 1, 1. Phil. 4, 22. Col. 1, 1. Philem. 7.
does often apply this name to all Christians: but those we mean, that have
obtained the true rewards of their holiness in Apo. 7, 9
heaven. Of whom the same S. PAVL does testify: that Heb. 11, 33. Ephesians. 5, 27.
Apo. 5, 8. and 7, 9. and 21, 2. and, 22.3. Ephesians. 4, 30. 1. Cor. 6; 19.
by faith they overcame Kingdoms, wrought Justice, obtained Promises. And
these in very deed, are Saints, immaculate, without spotte and wrinckell, these
are the most excellent members of the Church, and very choice instruments of
Gods holy spirit, unto whom no sin or evil, can ever have access. Which
Saints do consiste partly of Angelical, partly of humane nature, Creatures
certes of almost noble and blessed, to whom it is granted to be replenished
with those most excellent and eternal good things that are in heaven, and to
live always in most perfect love and friendship with Phi. 1, 23 2. Cor. 5, 1.6
Gregor. 4. mor. c. 32. Niss. de S. Ephr. and Ephrem. l. 1. comp. c. vlt.
Christ our Lord.

Therefore, by his favor, both they are able to Greg. lib. 12. mor. cap. 13.
and lib. 4. dial. c. 33. Aug. de cura pro mort. c. 15. and 16. Orig. lib. 8.
con. Cells. 4. Reg. 5, 26. and 6, 9. 1. Co. 14, 25
understand, what things are done amongst us upon earth: and because they are
inflamed with an exceeding Charity toward their breethren, though far
absent from them: they Da^ 10, 12 Mat. 18, 10. Heb. 1.14. Tob. 12, 12. Luc. 15,
7. Act. 5, 19 and 12, 7. Apoc. 5, 8. and 8, 3. Cypr. de mort. Naz. orat. 19.
are careful of our salvation, they favor us, and do wish us all manner of
good. And they deal so much more fervently in our behalf, by how much less
cause they have to be careful for themselves: and by how much greater
perfection of synceare Hier. in vigil. c. 2. 3. Bern. in vig. Pet. and Pau. and
sermon. 2. in festo eorundem. and ser. 2. de S. Vict.
charity and of all kind of virtue agreeable unto blessed Saints they
continually do exercise.

Not without great cause therefore do we Dam. l. 4. cap. 16.
reverence these lights of heaven, and next unto God the fortresses and
principal ornaments of the Church. Not without great cause do we esteem,
praise, imitate, and love exceedingly these Saints above all mortal men,
though never so excellent. Not without great cause, according to our small
power, we do exhibit great honor unto the^, being now advanced to such and so
great dignity. Finally, not without great cause, do we according to Christian
piety, make suit unto the^, and Bas. in 40. Mart. et in Mamatem. Naz. ora. 18.

call upon the^, not that they may give any thing as of themselves, but that
they may pray with us to God, the giver of all goodness, and that they may be
favorable and effectual intercessours, eue^ in their behalf that have
deserved no good at all.

Which kind of worship and invocation, if it be done rightly as it should: to
wit, so as that supreme Aug. lib. 10. ciu. c. 1 and lib. 20. cont. Faust.
ca. 21. and lib. 8. ciu. cap. 27.
worship and honor due unto Almighty God, which we called Latria, may stand
whole and perfect: there is doubtless no inconvenience therein, neither is it
To. 15, 30 Heb. 13, 18. Ephesians. 6, 18. Col. 4, 2. 1. These. 5, 25 2. These. 3, 1.
Luc. 7, 3. Job. 42, 8.
repugnant to holy Scripture, but is approved by many firm testimonies of the
Church, and is very profitable.

And in that we do in this manner with the Church honor and call upon the
Saints, it is so far off from obscuring the glory Conc. Trid. sess. 25.
of Christ our Lord and Savior, that it does more set forth and advance the
same. For herein does the most excellent virtue and glory of Christ our Redemer
shine and show it self, in that he does not only in himself, but in Ps. 67,
36. Joan. 14, 12.
his Saints also, appear mighty, glorious and marvelous: in that he honors
Io. 12, 26 Mat. 19, 28. Luc. 19, 17. Ap. 2, 26. and 3, 21. and 5, 10
them himself, and will have them exceedingly Psalm. 138, 17.
honored in heaven and in earth: also in that, that by them, and for their
sakes Chry. ho. 2. in Psalm. 50. and ho. 27. in Mat. and 42. in Genesis and f^r. de
virt. et vit.
he gives many things, and spares oftentimes the undeserving. For it is well
known that ABRAHAM, Genesis 26, 3.24. Ex. 32, 13.3. Reg. 11, 12.32.34.36 et 15,
4. Esa. 37, 35. 4. Reg. 8, 19. et 19, 34. et 20, 6. et 2. Mac. 15.12.
ISAAC, JACOB, DAVID, HIEREMIE, are read to have profited the living, though
they themselves were departed before.

Whereupon, the fathers Amb. and vid. et in ca. 21. Luc. Leo. se^. 1. et 2. de

when they speak of the Saints, they often call them our favorers,
intercessors, and Patrones. And not without cause doubtless: forasmuch as the
faithful suffrages of the Saints, when they are humbly and devoutly desired in
the name of CHRIST, are known by experience, to have done good to many.

Neither must we give ear unto malicious cauilers, who do falselye affirm,

unto men: that Saints are adored for Gods: that creatures are by Catholics,
made equal unto the Creator. For, that it is nothing so, both many other
things do convince, and amongst the rest that old and solemn supplication,
called the Lytanie, does testify: where God and the divine persons are
worshipped and inuocated, first of all, and in a far more high and excellent
manner, than the Saints Bern. ser. de 4. modis orandi. Victor. lib. 3. de

or all the orders of Saints together.

Hereupon also were those feasts of Saints instituted, which Saint AUGUSTINE

defends in this manner: The Christian people, says he, does celebrate the
memories of Martirs with a religious solemnity, that they may both stir
themselves up to the following of their steps; and also be made partakers of
their merits, and helped by their prayers.

9 Is the received use of the images of Christ and his Saints, contrary to
this first commandment? Bar. 6, 25.38. Deuteronomy. 4, 15. and 5, 8. Psa. 113, 12.

commended unto us, by Apostolical tradition; and we retain as approved by a

the same. And it is not only an absurd error, but also a most wicked madness

Then it requires, that according to the right use of the tongue we exhibit

17. and 4, 2. Trid. Sess. 4.

11 What are we bound unto by the third commandment?

IT requires, that we spend in good works the Sabothe or festival day
observed in the Church. And therefore it wills that our minds be then
present and void of cares, freely disposing it self, to yield interior and
exterior honor unto God in faith, hope, and charity. It wills us that
without all lets and incombrances: we meditate of Gods benefits, we be
occupied about holy things, we pray and honor almighty God both privately
and publicly with others Io. 4, 23 Deuteronomy. 5, 12. Number. 15, 32 Leu. 23, 2. Ignat.

in spirit and truth.

It forbids to labor on holy days, to spend any time in handicraftes, and
to use profane occupations, to the intent certes that we may attend to a holy
repose in going to the Church, and hearing Mass the public sacrifice of the
Church, and the ordinary Sermon, accordingly as godly devout persons have
al-waies accustomed to keep this commandment.

12 What is the sum of these three commandementes?

THese three first Commandments which appertain to the first August. quaest.
71. ^^ Exo. et in ps. 32. Conc: ^. see the annotation in the 5. sectio^ before
Table, do instruct and teach us how we may give true honor unto God: to wit,
interior and exterior: with heart, word, and deed: in private and in public.

The other seven hereafter following, are called precepts of the second Table,
added to this end to explicate our duty toward our neighbor.

13 What is proposed and enjoined in the fourth commandment? Deuteronomy. 5, 16. Col.
3, 20. Ephesians. 6, 1. Eccli. 3, 1.5. Prou. 23, 23. Tob. 4, 3.


Here, are children taught what duty they owe to their Parents by whose means
they came into this world, and by whose labor they are honestly brought up.

1. 1. Pet. 2, 13. and 5.5. Ephesians. 6, 5. Col. 3, 22.
are taught to perform their duty to their Superiors: that is to say, to all that are supereminent in some dignity and power, whether it be in Civil or
Ecclesiastical government.

And both they unto their Parents, and these unto their Superiors, do owe
both interior and Leu. 19, 32. 1. Pet. 2, 13. Genesis 43, 26. 1. Tim. 6, 1.

succor also and obedience.

Furthermore, we are forbidden any kind of way to offend Mat. 15, 3. Heb. 13,

or grieve any such persons of high calling or authority, be it by word,
deed, or any manner of sign.

14 What imports the fifth Commandment?

Genesis 9, 5. Leui. 24, 17. et 9, 16. and 19, 16. Deuteronomy. 5, 17. Ex. 20.13. and 21,
12. Mat. 5, 21. Ia. 2, 11 1. Ioa. 3, 15. Ephesians. 4, 26.31. Col. 3, 8. Ps. 4, 5.
To. 12, 17.19. Deu. 32, 35. Eccli. 28, 1. Heb. 10, 30. and 12, 15.
IT does not only prohibit all external slaughter and violence, that may
prejudice the body and life of our neighbor: but also cutteth of, anger,
hatred, rancour, indignation, desire of revenge, and all other internal
affectes tendinge any ways toward the hurt of our neigh-bour.

It requires meekness Ephesians. 4, 1. Col. 3, 12. To. 12, 14.17 1. Pet. 3, 8.
Ephesians. 6, 9. Phil. 4, 7. Mat. 6, 14. et 5, 38. and 18, 21, 33. Luc. 6, 37. Mar.
11, 25. Pro. 24, 29.
of mind, ciuility, clemency, courtesy, and beneficence: that is to say, that
we do easily forget injuries, and do not covet reuengement, but that we
pardon one an other all offenses, as God in Christ has Ephesians. 4, 23.
pardoned us.

15 What has the sixth commandment?

IT forbids fornication, aduoutrie, and all unlawful copulation, Leuit. 20,
10.22. and 19, 29. Deu. 22, 20. and 23, 17. Mat. 5, 28. Eccli. 41, 21.27. 1.
Cor. 6, 9.15. Ephesians. 4, 18. and 5, 3. Pro. 6, 24. Iud. 4.7.23.
and unclean voluptuousnes whatsoever.

Moreover, it will have occasions eschued and cut off, which do provoke and
cherishe the lusts of the flesh, as filthy Col. 3, 5.8. Ephesians. 5, 3.2, Pet. 2,
6.10.12.
speeches, dishonest songs, and unchaste gestures.

Contrarie-wise it requires fidelity 1. These. 4, 4. Heb. 13, 4. Tob. 4, 6. 1.
Cor. 7, 3.10.
in wedlock, also all manner of purity, both of mind in our Tob, 3, 16. Mat.

thoughts, and desires; and of 1. Tim. 5, 11. Eccli. 9, 3. Job. 31, 1.11. Pro.

body, in the tongue, face, eyes, ears, and touching, finally in all exterior
show and behavior: that whether we live in private or abrod with others; we
not only avoid all sign of riote, voluptuousnes and inte^perancy; but also
diligently practice modesty, frugality, and continency.

16 What are we taught in the seventh commandment? Leu. 19, 11.13.35.15. Ephesians.

11, 1. and 20, 10. Eccli. 10, 6.8 1 These. 4, 6.


IT forbids all unlawful handling, and usurpation of an other man's goods,
by theft, robbery, simony, usury, unjust lucre, cosenage, and any other
contracts, whereby brotherly charity is hurt, and our neighbor by craft
circumuented. Psalm. 14, 1. Luc. 6, 30. Eze. 18, 5.7.8.12.17. Romans 13, 7. Mat.
5, 40
On the contrary part this precept requires that in all business and trafique
whatsoever, justice be kept inuiolate, and that the profit of our neighbor
when occasion serves by all manner of means or help of our part be advanced.

8.27. and 22, 15. Iac. 3, 2.14.


17 What is comprehended in the eight commandment?

WE are by it prohibited to bear false and deceitful witness against any
man, and any way to subvert in judgment the cause of our neighbor, yea or out
of judgment to hurt his good name: which doubtless is done by all whisperers,
detractors, railers, false accusers, and flatterers. Breefelye all lying, and
abuse of the tongue against our neighbor is here forbidden.

We are with-all taught to speak well and favorably of our neighbor, Mat.
12, 35. Col. 3, 8.16 Ephesians. 4, 29. Pro. 15, 1.4.7. Eccli. 6, 1.5.
to wit for his defense and profit, without any color, dissimulation or
deceit.

18 The two last co^mandementes what do they contain?

Deu. 5, 20. Eccli. 25, 28. Mat. 5.28. To. 13, 9. 1. These. 4, 3. Iac. 1, 14.
Esa. 1, 23. Eccli. 5, 1. and 18, 30. Ps. 9, 25. and 61, 11. Act. 20, 33
THey forbid all concupiscence of an other man's wife or goods: that we do not
only abstain from other men's wives, unlawful traficke, and open manifest
wrong, but also that we do not so much as in will or desire, hurt, or
deliberate to hurt any man.

These two precepts therefore require the sincerity and benevolence of our
heart toward all men to be sound and perfect, Job. 31, 1.11 1 Cot. 10, 24.
Tob. 9, 9. and 10, 11. Genesis 24, 59. 1. Tim. 6, 9
that what-soeuer is for the commodity and health of our neighbor, we do
wish from our heart, and do not at any time consent to covetousness, with
the least injury that may be to another man.

19 To what end are all the ten commandementes to be referred?

TO charity, two sorts wher-of those two Exodus 32, 15. and 34, 1.
Tables wherein by the finger of God these commandments were engraven, do
commend unto us. For the commandementes of the first Table; do teach us that
which belongs to the love of God: and those of the second; that which
appertains to the love of our neighbor.

Therefore of these ten, the two first do cause thus much, that we do
speaciallye avoid those vices which are most repugnant to the service and
honor of God: as Idolatry, and perjury.

Then does the third commandment admonish us that we yield unto him in most
faithful manner true and pure service and honor in heart, word, and deed.
Which surely when it is well observed, no doubt but than God only is in all
things and above all things loved and honored.

Now, the su^me of the precepts, that belong to the love of our neighbor,
standethe even in this one point. That Tob. 4, 16.
which of an other thou hate to be done unto thee, see that not at any time
thou do it to an other. To which does answer that speech of Christ: Mat. 7,
12 Luc. 6, 31.
All things what-soeuer you will that men do to you, do you also to them: for
this is the law and the Prophets.

20 Which are the duties and arguments of brotherly charity?

1. Cor. 13, 4. Greg. lib. 10 mor. cap. 8.
OF these Saint PAVL discourses in this manner. Charity is patient, is
benign: Charity enuieth not, deals not peruersly, is not puffed up, is not
ambitious, seeks not her own, is not provoked to anger, thincketh not evil,
reioiseth not upon iniquity, but reioiseth with the truth: suffers all
things, believes all things, hops all things, bears all things.

And Christ, to the intent he might exhibit himself unto us, Joan. 13, 1.
Luc. 22.15
a pattern of true and perfect charity: in that last supper, which he
wonderfullye seasoned with excellent tokens of his charity, said very
earnestlye: A new Io. 13, 34*
commandment I give you, that you love one an other, as I have loved you, that
you also love one an other. And again: This is Io. 15, 12
my precept, that you love one an other, as I have loved you. Which surely is
of so great importance, that Saint PAVL affirms: That To. 13, 11.
he that loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law.

Therefore that we may conclude this place of charity with an Oracle of God
himself, it is thus written: Deu. 30, 20.
Choose life, that both thou may live, and thy seed: And love thy Lord thy
God: And obey his voice, and cleave unto him. For he is thy life, and the
length of thy days. Then that no man may doubt but that the Evangelical
doctrine of Christ does herein accord with the law, let us remember that
Christ himself did say: If Mat. 19, 17.
thou will enter into life keep the commandementes. And in an other place
having commended unto us the precepts and works of charity, he also annexeth
these words: This Luc. 10, 28.
do and thou shall live. To. 2, 13.
For not the hearers of the law are just with God, but the dooers of the law
shal-be justified.

OF these doers were Genesis 6, 9. and 7, 1. and in oratione Manassis. Sap. 10, 4.
Mat. 23, 35. and 1, 19. Job. 13, 18. Luc. 1, 6. and 2, 25, Iac. 2, 21.
ABEL, NOE, ABRAHAM, ZACHARY whom the Scripture testifies to have been just,
before God: as those that loved God and their neighbor in work and in truth.

Wherefore DAVID not the least amongst them, glorieng after a holy manner,
sings thus: I have Ps. 118, 32
run the way of thy commandementes, when thou have dilated my heart: I Ps.
118, 47.48.51.55.101.102.110.113.127.128.157.159.163.167.168.
have loved, I have observed, I have kept thy commandementes, and thy
testimonies: in Ps. 18, 12
keeping them much retribution: Ps. 118, 21.
accursed are they that decline from thy commandementes.

OF THE PRECEPTS OF THE CHVRCH.
1 Are there any other co^mandementes to be observed by Christians besides
these ten?

THere are doubtless: for-asmuch as our Iac. 4, 12.
Lawmakers and Mat. 23, 8.
master Christ has not only taught the ten commandments Mat. 19, 17.
of the Law, but has also commanded in general, al those things that do
concern the yielding of obedience unto Apostolical and Ecclesiastical
commandments. To this end are those speeches of the Gospel: Io. 20, 21 and
17, 18.
As my Father has sent me, I also do send you. He Luc. 10, 16.
that hears you, hears me: and he that despises you, despises me. If
Mat. 18.17.
he will not hear them, tell the Church: and if he will not hear the Church;
let him be to thee as the Heathen and the Publican; in which places, Christ
attributes, and wills to be attributed the chief and last judgment unto
the Church, that 3. Reg. 8, 14.
is to say, to the Prelates and Governors of the Church, as hom. 61 in Mat.
and Bas. c. 30. constit. monasti. Theophylac. and Eutim. in c. 18. Mat.
S. CHRYSOSTOM does interpret, and the words of the Gospel immediately
following do declare and convince.

For which cause it is not in vain written of the Apostle Saint. PAVL, He Act.
15.42. et 16, 4.
walked through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the Churches: commanding them to
keep the precepts of the Apostles and the Ancients.

11 What the^ are the precepts of the Apostles and Ancients which S. PAVL
would have us to keep?

SAint DENIS the Areopagite, Scoller of S. PAVL Eccl. Hier cap. 1. Bas. de
spir. Sanct. c. 27. Eusebius. lib. 1. demonst. c. 8 Epiph. haer. 61. contra
Apostolicos Tert. de cor. mil. c. 3. ^t. 4.
affirms, that they are of two sorts: to wit, partly written, and partly
unwritten. To both kinds does belong that which Saint IHON the Evangelist
says: He 1. Io. 46.
that knows God, hears us. He that is not of God hears us not. In this we
know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.

And surely the first kind which is committed to letters, and stands in
written Laws, is apparent enough: for that it consists of those books that
are Canonical.

But the latter consists in those precepts and ordinances, which are
comprehended under this one name of Traditions, and usually so called by the
Cyprian. de ablu. ped. Hiero. cont. Lucif. c. 4. Chrysostom. in 2. ad Thef. hom.
4.
Fathers. For they are not kept in writing, as the former, but delivered by
word of mouth, and as it were by hand from our Ancestors surrendered over unto
us, and commended unto the Church.

3 Are both these kinds of precepts necessary to be observed?

THey are doubtless, if we will follow the doctrine of Saint PAVL, giving us
this charge: Stand, 2. These. 2, 15. and ibid. Chrysostom. and Theophylact.
and hold the Traditions which you have learned, whether it be by Word, or by
our Epistle. Whereupon he in this respect commends the Corinthians, because
they did diligently keep the precepts of the 1. Cor. 11, 2.
Apostles, which they had already by word of mouth received. Then he warns
the Thessalonians, that they withdraw themselves from every 2. These. 3, 6.
brother walking inordinately, and not according to the Tradition received from
the Apostles.

And this is that which the holy Counsel of Nice consonant to 2. Nicen. act.
7. and 8. Sinod. c. 1.
divine Scripture, has expressed in so plain terms. It behooves us to
observe with one consent and inuiolably, Ecclesiastical Traditions; whether
they by writing, or by custom be retained in the Church. And we De ab^^^.
pedum.
read in S. CYPRIAN that, that is of no less force which the Apostles by the
inspiration of the holy Ghost have delivered, tha^ that which CHRIST himself
has delivered. For as Ibidem
the holy Ghost, and CHRIST have one and the same God-heade: so is the
authority and power of them both, equal in their sacred ordinances.

4 How may we know which are Apostolical and approved Traditions in the
Church?

OF these S. AUSTEN has In Epist. 118. ad Ian. cap. 1.
prescribed us a rule worthy to be noted, saying; Those things that we keep
not written, but delivered, which are certainly observed all the world over: it
is understood that they are holde^ as co^me^ded and ordained, either by the
Apostles themselves, or by general Counseles, whose authority in the Church is
most wholesome. So the same holy Doctor discoursing against the Lib. 4. c. 24.
and lib. 2. c. 7. and lib. 5. cap. 28.
Donatistes, yea eue^ against al Heretics, admonishes this very seriously;
look what the universal church holds, which by counsels has not bin
decreed, and yet ever has bin used: it is very well believed, that by no other
means, than by the authority of the Apostles themselves it has bin delivered.

And LEO Ser. 2. de Ieiunio Pe^tecostes.
the great agreeing hereunto, says. It is not at al to be doubted, but that
what-soeuer is holden in the Church as a custom of devotion, it proceeds
from Apostolical Tradition, and of the Doctrine of the holy Ghost.

5 What are those Apostolical Traditions which Christians must observe?

THere are sufficient store of examples extant amongst the Fathers, and such
of the Fathers, as above a thowsande years since deserved public credit. By
Tradition, ORIGIN in c. 6. ep. ad Romans
and l. 10. de genesis ad lit. c. 23. et con. Don. lib. 4. c. 24.
S. AUSTEN, do teach that Infants are to be baptized. S. DENIS de Eccle. hier.
c. 7.
and in exhor. ad castit. c. 11. et de cor. mil. c. 3. et de monog. c. 10.
TERTVLLIAN do show, that prayers and oblations ought to be made at the Altar
for them that are departed.

Hereupon S. HIEROME ad Marcell. ep 54. cont. erro. Montani.
and haeresi. 75. Acrii.
EPIPHANIVS do plainly affirm that the set fasts of the church, especially
that of LENT, are to be observed. So in like manner does Saint AMBROSE in
officio Mediolan.
and in Liturgia.
Saint CHRYSOSTOM auouche the dignity of those things, that are solemnly
prosecuted in the holy office of the MASS.

Than besides l. 4. c. 17. and in orat. de Imag.
DAMASCEN, the Fathers that the second Nicen Council does act. 6. tom. 4. and
act. 7.
cite, do witness by the same reason, that the Images of Christ and his Saints
are to be reverenced.

Finally to omit all others; that great and holy l. de spir. sanct. c. 27.
doctor Saint BASIL affirms that the sacred Chrisme and other solemn
ceremonies used in the most holy Sacraments, are holden upon tradition.

And the same Saint adds Ibidem.
further. If we do once attempt to refuse the ordinances and customs that are
not written, as things of small moment and importance: we shall covertly, and
by little and little, fall to disprove the very ratified sentences of the
Gospel, or rather we shall bring the preaching thereof to a bare name. But I,
c. 29. clus. them li.
says he, do think it Apostolical to stick to those Traditions also that
are not written.

6 How much at this day do men err and go astray about Apostolical and
Ecclesiastical Traditions?

VEry much no doubt; whilst many do despise them, others neglecte them, or at
the least, make no more account of them, than of the statutes of To. 13, 1.
civil Magistrates: and feign them to be decrees of me^, which may be observed
and broken at a man's pleasure, as being to very little, or no profit at all:
calling them things indifferent.

Some there are, who will have all manner of Traditions of like moment: and so
they do shamefullie confound certain places of Scripture, as though there
were no difference between Math. 15, 9.
Pharisaicall Traditions, and Apostolical; between Col. 2, 8.20. Mar. 7, 3.
Judicial, and 2. These. 2, 15, Act. 15, 42. and 16, 4,
Ecclesiastical, between private and particular Traditions, and Aug. ep. ad
Ian. 118. c. 1. and 2. and epist. 86. ad Casul.
those which being received by the consent of the whole Church, and approved so
many ages together, by the common custom of devout persons, and as it were by
hand delivered over unto us: are found in a manner all the world over.

7 What is to be thought of such as reject, and make no account of the
Traditions of the Church?

THese does the word of God reprove and condemn: when it appoints Traditions
to be 2 Thessalonians. 2, 15. 1. Cor. 11, 2
observed; and commands us to Mat. 18, 17.
hear the Church; and to keep the Act. 15, 42. and 16.4.
precepts of the Apostles and Ancients. It is the word of God that makes us
subject to Magistrates, both To. 13, 1. Mat. 22, 21.
Civil and Mat. 23, 2. Luc. 10, 16.
Ecclesiastical, to the modest, and also to the 1. Pet. 2, 13.
waiwarde, for To. 13, 5.
conscience sake: It will have us give both great Tit. 3, 1.
reverence and obedience unto their Laws. He. 13, 17
Obey says it, your prelates and be subject unto them. Mat. 23, 2.
Al things that they shall say to you, observe ye, and do ye; but according
to their works do ye not. Wherefore, these fellows do not only despise men,
but God 1 Thessalonians. 438. 1. Cor. 14, 37.
himself most gracious and mighty, whom they should hear and reverence in
the Ioa. 20, 21. and 17, 18 and Luc. 10, 16.
Apostles and their Cyprian. epist. 69. ad Flor. Pas. cap. 23. constitut. mon.
successors. Therefore they do manifestly resist the word of God, whilst
they resist the power and ordinance of God, and purchase damnation unto
themselves thereby, if we believe To. 13, 2.
S. PAVL.

Vndoudtedly this is the very ordinance of God himself, which cannot be
abolished by any authority of man, that by certain Laws, and those partly
written, and partly unwritten, which the Tradition of the Bas. de Spir. Sanct.
cap. 27. Aug. lib. 4. cont. Dona. c. 24. et l. 2. c. 7. et l. 5. c. 23. et 26.
Epiph. haeresi. 55. Eusebius. l. 3. histor. c. 30.
Apostles commends unto us: the Church be governed, true Doctrine preserved,
Religion defended, Concord nourished, Discipline kept and observed.

8 What has the judgment of the Fathers been about this matter?

ORIGIN, a famous and very ancient author, has written in these words.
Every such on^ is of us to be accounted an In cap. 3. ep. ad Tit. test
Pamphilo in apol. pro Origin. Iten. l. 4. c. 43
Heretic, that professes himself to believe Christ; and believes
otherways of the truth of Christian faith, than has the definition of the
Churches Tradition. And the same in an other place. That, ^l. 1. periar. in
Proo^ mio.
only is to be thought the truth, says he; which in no point disagreeth from
the Tradition of the Church. And it is the speech of S. HIEROME: I do ad
Lucinium ep. 28
think it good to admonish thee, that the customs of the Church, espeacially
those that are not against faith, are so to be observed, as they were delivered
from our ancestors.

And S. AUGUSTINE ep. 118. cap. 5.
teaches in this manner: If the authority of divine Scripture do prescribe
any thing; there is no doubt, but that we ought so to do, as we have read: and
so in like manner if the Church do use any thing through out the world, for to
dispute, that a man ought not so to do: were a part of most insolent madness.
And again the same: In ad Casul. ep. 86.
those matters wherein the word of God has set down no certainty; the custom
of Gods people, or the decrees of our Ancestors are to be holden as a law.
And as the transgressors Distinct. 11. c. in his.
of divine laws, so also the contemners of the Churches customs are to be
restrained.

Finally TERTVLLIAN a most learned and ancient writer of the Church, in one
whole book together disputes Lib. de praescript.
against those, that do admit nothing that is not expressly set down in the
Scripture, and he contendeth very earnestly, that there be certain unwritten
Traditions and observations of the Church, which none can take exceptions
against, but heretics only. But, If any man seem to be co^tentious, (that we
may use 1. Cor. 11, 16.
S. PAVLS words) We have no such custom, nor the Church of God.

9 I pray you then what is the Church?

Romans 12, 4. 1. Cor. 12, 12. 1. Pet. 5, 4. Io. 21, 15. Mat. 16, 18.
THE Church is the whole multitude of all those that profess the faith and
doctrine of Christ, which Christ the Prince of Pastors, committed both unto S.
PETER the Apostle, and also to his Chryso. l. de Sacerdoti. Conc. Flor. Bern.
l. 2. de consid. c. 8.
successors to be fed and governed.

And therefore all Heretics and Schismatickes do not deserve the name of a
Church, but do Hier. cont. Lucif. c. 9. Cypr. epist. 69.
falsely arrogate the same unto themselves: who although they seem to profess
the faith and doctrine of Christ: yet they refuse to be the sheep of the high
Pastor and Bishop which Christ has made chief governor over the sheepfold of
the Church in his own steed, and has by perpetual Iren. l. 3. c. 3. Tert. l.
3. con. Mar. c. 9. Optat. l. 2. Aug. ep. 165. et 42. et in Ps. cont. partem
Donat. et lib. 2. contr. lit. Petil. c. 51,
succession in the Roman Church continually preserved.

This Chair of S. PETER, this primacy of the Church, whosoever does deny and
oppugn: first, they do not understand the large promises of Christ, Mat. 16,
18. Io. 21, 15. Luc. 22,, 31 Mat. 10, 2. Joan. 1, 42. Mat. 17, 24. Act. 1.15.
made unto S. PETER, and the mystical keys of the kingdom of heaven
delivered to him only, and many other things written of Saint PETER the Cypr.
de simpl. Hill. et Hier. in c. 16. Mat. Hier. in Ion. l. 1. c. 14. Ciril. l. 2.

Prince, the mouth and head of the Apostles. Then they do manifestly break
the peace and certain order of the Church, which without an high Bishop and
his supereminent authority, can neither be well governed nor kept long in
unity, nor hold that sound strength that is necessary to bear out the
violence of hell gates. Lastly they do impudently discredit the Fathers, and
their Councils and writings consenting all together about this manifest Aug.
cont. ep. Fund. c. 4. et de vtilitate cred. c. 17. et lib. 11. cont. Faustum.
cap. 2.
note of the Church, yea and the consonant voice of all Christianity.

This Church and Her dignity acknowledged Saint HIEROME; whose ad Dam ep. 58.
et ep. 57. ad cund.
words are these: he that is joined to PETER'S chair, is mine. Optatus of l. 2.
cont. Donat.
Afric has acknowledged her; who witnesses that among the true notes of the
Church, the Chair of Saint PETER is the principal. ep. 162. 90. 92. 93. 165.
S. AUGUSTINE has acknowledged Her; who writes expressly, that in the Church
of Rome the Sovereignty of the Sea Apostolic has al-waies flourished. Saint
ep. 55. and 69. Hier. cont. Lucif. c. 4. Leo. ep. 84. ad Anast. cap. 11.
Cyprian has acknowledged her; who imputes the cause of all Haeresies and
Schisms that do grow, to this alone; that men do not obey one high Priest,
and Judge in Christ his room. Saint Ambrose l. 3. de sacram. c. 1. and de
obitu Satyr.
has acknowledged Her; in so much that he has said, that in all things he
did covet to follow the Roman Church.

And more ancient than al these, and near unto the Apostles time, that very
Apostolical man Ireneus, Lib. 3. c. 3. Tert. de praescrip. cap. 36. Cypr. ep.
45. and 46. Theod. l 2. hist. cap. 4. Ber. ep. 190. ad Innoc. and lib. 2. de
co^sid. cap. 8. Con. Chalc. action. 3. Anaclet. ep. 1. and 3. Marcell. ep. 1.
Synedus Alexand. ad Foelicem.
gives such a testimonial of commendation to the Church of Rome: To this
Church says he, because of the chiefer principallitie, it is necessary that
all the Church have recourse, that is to say, all the faithful that are
dispersed in all places: in which Church by those that are in all places of the
world has always ben conserved the Apostolical Tradition.

10 What dignity and authority has the Church?

Almighty God does advance his Church, 1. Cor. 12.28 Ephesians. 5, 25. Io. 14,
15.26 and 16, 12. and 17, 11.17. Mat. 28, 20. and 16, 18. Psalm. 120, 4.
of all things upon earth the most dearest unto him, with many and most
excellent dowries, promises, and benefits. Her, he does always adorn,
preserve, defend and maintain.

Her also he has appointed to be his 1. Tim. 3, 15. Ps. 22, 2. Io. 10, 16.
house, wherein all the Sons of God, may be cherished, taught and exercised.

His pleasure was to make Her the 1. Tim. 3, 15. Aug. lib. 1. cont. Cre^ cap.
33. ^ 2. cap. 32.
pillar and ground of truth, that we may not doubt any whit of Her doctrine,
which as a maistres, keeper, and interpreter of the truth, obtains credit
and authority inviolable.

Moreover, he has determined that she should be builded upon a sure Mat. 1^
18. and 7, 25. Ephesians. 2, 20. Psalm. 86, 2. and 47, 9. Aug. in Psalm. 47. Alcim.
lib. 4. cap. 14.
Rock; that we might assuredly know how she is immovable and steadfast; and
how she prevails as unvanquishable against the very gates Mat. 16, 18.
of hell, to wit, the most sharp and grievous assaults of all adversaries.

Finally he will have Her to be a certain City Apo. 21, 2 Mat. 5, 15. Esa.
2, 2. Mich. 4, 1. Mal. 1, 11. Act. 1, 8. P. 21, 26.28.
most holy set upon a hill, apparent to all men, and easy to go unto: least
any man forsaking Her, 1. Io. 2, 19.
might betake himself to the pestiferous dens and dungeons of Haeretickes;
and being seduced with those false speeches, Mat. 24, 23. and ibid. Orig.
tract. 29. and 30.
Behold here is Christ, behold there; might depart and be with-drawne from
her.

This is the Cant. 4, 7 and 6, 8.
Lover, Sister and only spouse of Christ, which holy Scripture proposes and
commends unto us, for whose Ephesians. 5, 26.
Redemption, clensing, Sanctification, gathering together, Io. 11, 52. Col. 1,
18.24 Ephesians. 4, 12. and 1, 22.
and wholly uniting unto himself: the Son of God, did and suffered all
things, in so much as he doubted not to give his most holy body and blood for
the love of her.

For Her he asked Io. 17, 21 Luc. 22, 31. Mat. 16, 18.
and obtained, that Her faith, unity and steadfastness might never fail.

To her Io. 14, 15.26. et 15, 26. and 16, 12.
he has promised, and faithfully Act. 2, 4
sent down and left a teacher, president and governor, and the holy Ghost:
He, Io. 14, 26
says he, shall teach you all things, and suggest unto you all things,
whatsoever I shall say to you: he Ibidem 16.
shall abide with you for ever: He shall Io. 16, 13 Aug. tract. 97. in Mat.
teach you all truth, to wit whatsoever is necessary to be known and
believed.

11 By whom I pray you does the holy Ghost teach us the truth in the Church?
Act. 20, 28. 1. Tim. 3, 2. Heb. 13, 17. Ephesians. 4, 12. 1. Cor. 12, 28.


BY those undoubtedly, whom the Apostle witnesses to be ordained by the holy
Ghost, to govern the Church: whom he calls Bishops, Prelates, Pastors also
and Doctors. And these Aug. in Psalm. 44.
after the Apostles have been ever and yet are the chief Ministers of God and
of the Church, and high Stewardes and Dispensors 1. Cor. 4, 1.
of the mysteries of Almighty God.

The authority of whom both in many other things and espeacially in the Sacred
Can. Apost. 38. Conc. 1. Nic. Soz. l. 6. c. 7. Theodos. imper. apud Cyrillum
ep. 4. Basil. imperat. in 8. Synod. act. 10. Atha. in ep. ad solit. vita^:
agentes Ruff. lib. 1. hist. ca. 5.
Synods may evidently be seen: where they have not only power to determine
certain things of Faith and Religion: but also by their own right and
Apostolic auctority, to proteste and say; It has seemed good to the holy
Ghost and us, as it appears by the acts of the first Council holden Act.
15, 28.
at Jerusalem. It was certes of old, a very heinous crime, and such a one as
was punished by Deuteronomy. 17, 12.
death, if any man had not obeyed the judgment of the Highe-Prieste, that
governed the Mat. 23.2.
chair of MOSES. And yet the Cypr. ep. 55. ad Corn. and ep. 62. ad Pomp.
Church has now authority in governing, iudgeing and decreeing, no whitte
inferior to that, which then the Synagog had. That Law of obedience that was
amongst the Jews, stands also in force amongst the Christian: that the
judgments of the Highe-Preists, whose dignity and authority is most
excellent; about Greg. l. 1. ep. 24. ad Patriar. et l. 2. indict. 11. ep. 10.
ad Sauin. Niceph. l. 16. ca. 33.
all such matters as do belong unto Religion, be received, approved, and
observed.

And therefore they do incur the guilte of an enormous crime, who are so far
off from yielding any authority and obedience unto the Magistrates of the
Church; that they presume even openly to oppugn and abolishe, sometime the
holy 3. Conc. Tol. c. 1. did. 19. et 9. qu. 1 Patet. et seq.
Laws of the High-Bishoppes, who have always had Hier. ad Damas. ep. 57. et
58. Chalc. Syn. act. 3. in epi. ad Leon. 6. Syn. act. 4.
supreme power and authority to determine of holy things: And sometime the
reverend decrees of general Counsails, whose authority in the Church, as S.
AUGUSTINE ep. 118. c. 1. et l 1. con. Donat. c. 18. Greg. vt supra.
speaks is most wholesome: Finally sometime the undoubted sentences of the
Fathers about matters of faith, whose general judgment, and Vin. Lirinens.
cont. Nouat. Aug. l. 1. and 2. contr. Iul. Pacia^. ep. 1. ad Sympro^.
consent in one matter, is a firm testimony of Christian verity. It was very
notablely spoken of good, and devout Emperors: He does Actio. 3. Con. Chalc.
Gelas. in ep. ad Epi. Dar. Leo. ep. 43. and 50. ad Mart. and 78. ad Leonem
Augustum.
injury to the judgment of the Counsel, whosoever goes about to call into
question and public disputation, those things that are once judged, and
rightly disposed.

12 To what end is this divine ordinance and appointment, that there be
always Pastors and Doctors in the Churcb?

THis ordinance of God is not a little profitable and wholesome for us, by which
the power and holy gouernemente of the Church, does Chrysostom. l. 3 de sacerd. and
ho. 4. and 5. de verb. Isa. Ignat. ad Smyrnenses. Ambr. in exhort. ad Virgins
and l. 2. de dignit. sacerd. cap 2.
far excel all Civil authority. For this is a spiritual power, by which the
Christian people is singularly furthered in the atcheiuing of spiritual and
eternal good things.

And first, It profits that we may use the words of Ephesians. 4, 12
S. PAVL to the consummation of the Saints: that is to say, that they which do
exercise that power, may exhibit every Col. 1.28.
man perfect in Christ, as the same Apostle speaks in an other place, and by
their diligence bring the faithful to that perfection of holiness, 1. These.
4, 7. 2. Tim 3, 17. 2. C^r. 13, 11.
to which they have been called.

It profits also; to the work of the ministry, that they which are called
and are in deed the chief ministers of the Church, may be always Act. 20,
28. Heb. 13, 17. Cypr ep. 66. ad Furn.
vigilant and careful according to the great and high function committed unto
their charge.

It profits besides; Ephesians. 4, 12.
unto the edifying of the body of Christ, that these spiritual and wise
Architectes 1. Cor. 3, 10.
may know, that about the Ephesians. 1, 23. Col. 1, 18.24. Ephesians. 2, 21.
mystical body of Christ, which requires a singular industry in the
building, they must be continually occupied; sometime to lay and fortify the
foundations of true faith; sometime to build 1. Cor. 3, 12.
up other things necessary, to the perfect righteousness of the faithful.

It profits finally; Ephesians. 4, 14 1. Cor. 14, 20. To. 15, 1 Act. 14, 21. 1 Thessalonians. 3, 2 and 4, 1. Ezech. 34, 2.
that we be not children, wavering and carried about with every wind of
doctrine, in the wickedness of men, that is to say: for the weaker sort
(which are always in the Church very many in number) the function of
Ecclesiastical Prelates is very necessary: espeacially at such time as the
tempests of heresies, and the storms of Mat. 7, 25.
persecutions do beat into the house of the Church. For then there is need of
the present help of those, who according to their authority both will and can
keep Act 20, 29. Eze 33, 6. 2. Tim. 2, 23.25. and 4, 2. Tit. 1, 9.10.11.
off the wolves, defend the sheep, root out the cockle, and confirm sound
doctrine, least otherwise the simple be seduced by the words, writings, and
examples of deceiptful and wicked persons, 2. Pet. 2, 1. and 3, 3. To. 16, 17.
Iud 17.4 10 Mat. 7.15.
from the kingly rodeway of truth: but rather that all, not only knowing the
truth, but practicing the same; may grow and go forward in him that is the
head, Christ our Lord, as the same Apostle S. PAVL Ephesians. 4, 15.
has also spoken.

13 By what means may we obtain these so singular commodities?

BY this no doubt; if we be not to highlye, To. 12, 3.
but soberly wise; always careful to Ephesians. 4, 3. Io. 10, 2. and 21, 17.
keep the unity of spirit in the band of peace, that so we may show our
selves the humble and obedient sheep of Christ. Of which sheep certes it is
the property, Io. 10, 2. Tit. 3, 1. Heb. 13, 17. Mat. 10, 20.
to fly the wolves: and not to follow Aliens but their own Pastors: Bern.
de praecep. and disp. c. 12.
to submit themselves to the^, as to the ordinary Prefectes of our Lords
fold, and in them to hear the Io. 15, 26 et 14, 17. et 16, 13.
spirit of truth.

That spirit it is, which vouchsafes even by evil Mat. 23, 2. Phil. 1, 15.
Io. 11, 51. Mat. 18.17. Deuteronomy. 17, 12
Prelates, to teach, feed, and preserve our Lords flock: and which by them,
commends unto us the precepts both of God our Father and the Church our
Mother, in these words: Pro. 1, 8. see Epiphan haer. 75.
Hear my son the discipline of thy father, and do not let go the law of
thy mother. And again the same does inculcate; Keep says Pro. 6, 20
he, my son the precepts of thy father, and do not let go the law of thy
mother.

14 Which are the precepts of the Church?

THere are five principal, necessary doubtless to be known and observed of
every Christian.

1 Conc. Lugdun. apud Iuone^. p. 4. c. 14. 2. Matiscon. c. 1. Mogunt. c. 36. et
37. Tribur. c. 35. Ignat. ad Philip.
The appointed holy days of the Church do thou celebrate.

2 Conc. Agath. c. 47. et 21. Tribur. c. 35. 1. Aurel. ca. 28.
The holy office of the Mass, upon holy days, do thou hear with reverence.

3 Canon. Apost. 68. Gangren. c. 19. Ignat. ad Phil. Mog. c. 34. et 35.
Salegunst. c. 1. et 2. Ber. in vig. S. Andreae. See the places cited in the
treatis of good works in the 4. question.
The Fastes on certain days and times appointed, do thou observe. For
example, as the Lent, imber days, and the next days before certain solemn
feasts, which our forefathers have Tert. l. 2. ad Vxo. c. 4. et in apolog cap.
2.
called vigils or euens, because they did use at such times all night to watch
in the Churches.

4 Sinod. Lateran. can. 21. Triden. sess. 14. c. 8.
Thy Sins to thy proper Priest do thou every year confess.

5 Lateran. and Trident. sess. 13. can. 9.
The holy Eucharist, at the least once in the year and that about the feast of
Easter do thou receive.

15 What profit does the observation of these precepts bring?

THese and other the like customs, and precepts of the Church so many ages
received, and with great consent and practice of devout Christians, confirmed,
and very agreeable to piety and reason: do bring with them very notable and
excellent commodities.

For they are wholesome exercises of faith, humility, and Christian obedience:
they do advance honest Phil. 4, 8. 1. Cor. 14, 26.40.
discipline and concord among the people: they are goodly signs and badges of
Religion: finally they give marks and tokens of our inward piety, by which
we ought jointly to shine with the good, and to show our light to the evil
for Mat. 5, 17. To. 15, 2. Phil. 2, ^.14.
their edification.

Briefly, they do help us to this, that we may exactly observe that rule of
the Apostle; Let all things 1. Cor. 14 40.
be done honestly, and according to order among you.

16 Wherein, is the authority of the Church necessary unto us?

FIrst of all surely in this, that we may certainly Gal. 2, 2. 1. Tolc. c. 25.
Aug. ser. 129 de te^p. and li. 13. contra. Faust. c. 4. and 5. et l. 28. c. 2
and 4.
discern the true and canonical Scripture from that which is counterfeit and
apocryphal. Whereupon Saint HIEROME does testify: we receive, says he, the
in sym. ad Damasu. and et Aug. ser. 19. 1. de te^. Conc. Laod c. 59. Conc. 3.
Carth. c. 47. Conc. Trid. sess. 4.
old and new Testament, in that number of books, which the authority of the
holy Catholic Church does deliver. And Cont. ep. Fund. c. 5.
Saint AUGUSTINE: I truly would not believe the Gospel, except the
authority of the Catholic Church did move me thereunto.

It is also necessary; that we may be assured of the Esa. 59, 21. Aug. l. 1.
c. 33. cont. Cresco et de unit. Eccle. c. 22. Trid. ses. 4. Vin. Lir. contr.
nouatores
true sense and apt interpretation of the Scripture: least that otherwise we
never make an end of doubting and disputing about the sense of the words. For
all Heretics, as the same holy Saint lib. 1. de Trinit. c. 3. Hillar. l. 2.
ad Constanti. Vinc. Lir.
has written: do labor to defend their false and deceiptfull opinions by the
holy Scriptures, and yet the Scriptures do not consist in reading, but in
understanding: as witnesses Cont. Lucif. c. 9. and in c. 1. ad Gal. Hilar. l.
2. de Trin.
Saint HIEROME. Thirdly; that in the waightier questions Deuteronomy. 17.8.
and controversies of faith that may fall out, there may be some Act. 15, 2
Judge by whose authority matters may be moderated. For as that is most true
that haer. 61. cont. Apostolicos.
EPIPHANIVS teaches against Heresies, that all things can not be had out of
the Scriptures: so does l. 11. con. Faust. c. 2 and l. 7. c n. Donat. c. 53. et
in Ps. 57.
Saint AUGUSTINE most rightlye affirm: that the authority of the Catholic
Church is of special waighte and value for our faith and assurance in a
doubtful case. Neither can the holy Ghost be wanting to the Church to lead her
(as Christ has Io. 14, 16. and 16, 13.
promised) into all truth.

Again; that for the diversity of persons, places, and times, canons Can. Ap.
38. et Synod. 1. Nic. c. 5. Lateran. Can. 6.
may be ordained, perfect discipline preserved, and judgments pronounced. For
to the Church, 2. Cor. 10, 8. and 13, 10.
has God given this power to edification, and not to destruction. Moreover; to
the intent that the stubbourne and rebellious persons may feel that Mat. 18,
17. et ibi Hieron.
power of chastising and excommunication, which Christ has ordained, and
Saint 1. Cor. 5, 3. 1. Tim. 1, 20.
PAVL exercised: and by the same may be corrected and repressed. Here upon l.
de fid. et op. c. 5. and 3. and l. 3. con. Parm. c. 2. Greg. ho. 26 in Euang.
Chrysostom. l. 3. de Sacerd.
S. AUGUSTINE: they, says he, that govern in the Church, may exercise
discipline, so it be without tumulte and in peaceable manner, against the
wicked and outrageous.

Wherefore, in all these things, to omit many others, it is manifest that the
Churches authority is not only profitable, but also necessary: so that
without the same, doubtless, the Christian commonwealth, might be thought
nothing else but a very Babylonical confusion. And therefore, as we do believe,
the Scripture, and rely upon it, and attribute unto it speaciall authority,
for the testimony of the holy Ghost speaking 2. Pet. 1, 19. 2. Tim. 3.16 Mat.
18, 17. Io. 14, 16.26 and 16, 12.
within it: so also do we owe faith, reverence, and obedience, to the Church;
for that by Christ her head and spouse, she is informed, endowed, and
confirmed with the Act. 2, 4. Ephesians. 4, 4.
same spirit, so that it is not possible but that she be as she is called: the
1. Tim. 3, 15.
Pillar and ground of truth.

17 What is the fruit and commodity of the whole doctrine touching the
precepts and Traditions of the Church?

IT is certes very great and full of variety. And surely the first is, that we
may know, that we are not tied to letters only, or to divine Scriptures. For,
to use the words of Saint Ireneus: Lib. 3. c. 4 Epi. haer. 61.
What if the Apostles had left us no Scriptures? must we not have have
followed the order of Tradition, which they delivered unto them, to whom they
committed the Churches? therefore has S. BASIL Lib. de spir. sanct. c. 27.
said very well: The verities which are held and taught in the Church; some
we have out of the doctrine set forth in writing: some we have received from
the Tradition of the Apostles, in mystery, that is, in hidden and secret
manner. Both which, have equal force and authority to the furtherance of
piety. And these no man will gainesay, that has been but even meanly
experienced; what the laws of the Church are. And it ca^ not be doubted, but
that Io. 20, 30 and 21.25. Aug. ep. 108 ad seleucianam.
Christ and his Apostles, both did and taught many things, which although they
are not written, yet they do very much appertain unto us and all posterity.
Of which S. PAVLL Phil. 4, 8.
warning us in general, says. For the rest, brethren, what things soever be
true, whatsoever honest, whatsoever just, whatsoever holy, whatsoever amiable,
whatsoever of good name: if there be any virtue, if any praise of discipline:
these things think upon: which you have both learned, and received, and
heard, and seen in me: these things do you, and the God of peace be with you.

The next commoditiy of them is, that we may rightly use Christian liberty,
which men given to idleness and riote, if ever at any time, now most of all
do make an occasion to the flesh, as the Gal. 5, 13 2. Pet. 2, 19.
Apostle speaks: under pretense thereof they serve their filthy pleasures:
and whatsoever in a manner they have a fancy unto, though it concern even the
alteration of the decrees of Religion: they think it lawful for them to do.
Aug. ep, 118 cap. 1. and 5.
But from this profane novelty and rashness; the Apostolical and
Ecclesiastical Doctrines, and decrees, do call away, defend, and terrify us:
bridling man's licentiousness, and teaching us to use Christian liberty in a
convenient sort: to wit, so that 1. Pet. 1, 18. To. 6, 18.22. Gal. 3, 13. and
4, 31. To. 8, 2.
being made free by Christ, from the yoke of sin and bondage of the old
law, we may willingly and of our Psa. 53, 8. Col. 3, 23. Luc. 1, 71. 2. Cor.
3, 17 To. 6, 22. 1. Cor. 9, 19. 1. Pet. 1, 22. and 2, 20. Luc. 21, 19. Mat. 4,
1.7. and 16, 14.
own accord perform Christian duty: we may serve God in holiness and
justice: we may follow the holy Ghost as our guide in the law of Charity,
being the servants of justice, the sons of obedience, the practisers of
humility, the keepers of patience, and lovers of penance, and of the Cross.
You, says the Ga^l. 5, 1^
Apostle, are called into liberty: only, make not this liberty an occasion to
the flesh, but by charity of spirit serve one another. To the nourishing and
maintenance of which charity of spirit in the dutifulness of an holy
servitude: both all honest things are profitable; and the devout observation
of the Tradition of the Church, is undoubtedly most available.

The last use and commoditye is; that we may truly discern between the lawful
and bastard children of the Church, or between Catholics and Heretics. For
Vincen. Liren.
the first, do simply stay them selves in the doctrine of the Church, whether
the same be delivered unto them in writing, as in the Bible; or approved by the
Tradition of the Fathers. For they do follow the word of God: Do Pro. 22,
28. Eccli. 8, 11. Deuteronomy. 32, 7. Hier. c, 16.
not go beyond the ancient bounds, which thy Fathers have set. But, the
other which are Heretics, do swerve from this simplicity of faith, and from
the approved sentence of our reverend mother the Church, and of the holy
Fathers: and they trust to much either unto them selves, or to those that have
revolted from the Church: insomuch as even being warned they do not come back
and amend their error. And therefore of them has Saint PAVL so severely
decreed, when he says: A man Tit. 3, 10.
that is an Heretic, after the first and second admonition, avoid: knowing
that he that is such a one, is subverted. And to conclude with ad Pompeium.
S. CYPRIAN, whosoever has revolted from the unity of the Church; he must
needs be found in the company of Heretics.

18 What finally is the sum of all the premises?

THose things that from the beginning hitherto have been handled, touching
the sum of Christian doctrine; do tend to this end: that the true wisdom of
a Christian man might be described and set before us: which is comprehended in
these three Aug. l. 2. tetr. c. 63.
virtues 1. Cor. 13, 13. 2. Tim. 2, 22
faith, hope, and charity. By faith, the soul, does Heb. 11.1
firmlie consent unto Gods truth, and rely upon the same. By hope, she does
yet more Gal 5, 5.
neerelye apprehend the goodness of Almighty God, known now and conceived by
faith: finally To. 8, 38. Io. 14, 21.23 To. 13, 8. Aug. in Enchir. c. 7.
by charity she is joined and united unto God; and for God, to her neighbor.

Now as concerning faith: the Creed of the Apostles does instruct us, in that
it sets before us those things that are espeacially to be believed and
professed of every Christian. And of those things that are to be hoped and
prayed for: our Lords prayer has informed us. Then, unto charity; do those
things belong, which in the two Tables of the ten commandments are exhibited
unto us.

It is therefore a very notable saying of in cap. 4. ep. ad Romans
ORIGIN: I do think (says he,) that faith is the first beginning, and the
very foundation of salvation: and hope is the advancement and increase of the
building: but that charity is the perfection and top of the whole work.

Happy then are they which Luc. 11, 28. To. 2, 13. Luc. 6, 46. Mat. 7, 21.24.
et 19, 17. et 25, 35. Io. 15, 2. Mat. 10, 22. et 24, 13.
hear and keep the word of God: and they that know the will of the Father
and do fulfill the same: walking and perseuering in faith, hope, and charity,
by the government and protection of Christ our Lord.

And this truly for the scope of our intention is sufficient, touching those
chife and principal virtues, which, because they are infused by God, and do
make mortal men become divine: are worthily called virtues Theological, and
are rightly referred to Christian wisdom.

19 Is there any other thing that belongs unto Christian doctrine?

YEa verily: for the doctrine of the Sacraments does expressly appertain
thereunto: that Christians may know, what instruments, as it were, they have
need of, ordained by God, for the obtaining, exercising, increasing,
preserving, yea and also repairing of Aug. in Io. Tract. 120.
faith, and hope, and espeacially charity.

Yea and moreover very true it is: that neither Christian wisdom, nor
Christian Justice can be established or holden without Sacraments: as without
the which all Aug. l. 19 cont. Faust. c. 11. et de vera relig. c. 17 et ep.
118. cap. 1.
Religion must needs be extinguished.

They therefore are of very great importance in Christian doctrine, and very
requisite it is that we handle them in particular.

THE FOVRTHE CHAPTER OF THE SACRAMENTS.
1 Why are Christians to be instructed about the Sacraments?

BEcause the knowledge and use of the Sacraments does bring to pass; that
Christians, having by the merits of JESUS Christ received grace; which is given
by the Tit. 3, 5. Io. 3, 5. et 6, 51.55. et 20, 23.
Sacraments; may be rightly exercised, and preserved, and set forward in divine
worshipe.

2 What, and of how many sorts is this divine worshipe?

THat is called divine worshipe, which a Christian owes and yeldeth as the
highest Aug. l. 10 de ciu. c. 1.
and chiefest service to God his creator and Savior.

For there is no doubt, but that for this cause Pro. 16, 4. Genesis 1, 26. 2. Cor.
5, 15. 1 Thessalonians. 5, 9 1. Pet. 3, 9.
espeacially was man at the first made, and afterward redeemed, and unto this
wholly designed and appointed: that he might purely and perfitly serve and
worship Almighty God.

Now divine worshipe is of two sorts: interior and exterior. The interior,
by which we are in understanding and in will Aug. in Ench. c. 2. and 3.
joined unto God; is accomplished by faith, hope, and charity, as has been
said before. The exterior; is a certain profession of the interior; which
we declare by certain Mat. 5, 17. To. 12, 17. 2. Cor 8, 21.1. Cor. 14, 40.
outwatd and visible signs and ceremonies. For God, that has no Ps. 15, 2. 1.
Tim. 6, 15 Mat. 5, 48. Genesis 2, 7.
need of any good of ours, as being of himself blessed and wholly perfect:
yet as his pleasure was that the wholle man should consist both of a body and
a soul: so does he require the same again Pro. 16, 14. Luc. 10 27. Mat. 22
37. Deuteronomy. 6, 5.
wholly: to wit, according to all and every part of him; that he may by him be
worshipped studiously and sincerely: first in soul, according to the interior
worship as we have declared: and in 1. Cor. 6, 19. Ps. 83, 3.
body, according to the exterior joined with the interior: which is done many
ways; but principally, and most profitablie by the use of Sacraments.

For so it has seemed good to the wisdom of God, to coapte it self to the
imbecillitye of mortal men, and to exercise his might and power by certain
external things Aug. in Ps. 73. et l. 19 cont. Faust. c. 11. et l. 3. de
doctri. Christ. c. 9. q. 84. in Leuit. et 33. super Number. Tert. de resur. carnis
c. 8. Greg. in primum regum. l. 6. c. 3.
and signs, that may be perceived by the senses. For our mind and soul
immortal, being enclosed in this obscure, and brickle body as in a prison;
does very much use the service of the senses, and without the Chrysostom. ho. 60.
ad Pop. Ant. et 83. in Mat.
help of them, she does not commonly mount to the conceit of heavenly
things. Therefore both in the old and new law, Sacraments, and many other
things appertaining unto exterior worship, have been by God ordained, and
always by the people of God observed.

3 What is a Sacrament?

IT is an external and visible sign of Bern. ser. de caen. domini. Aug. l.
10. ciu. c. 5. and l. 3. doct. Chr. c. 9. Amb. l. 4. de Sacram. c. 4. Council.
Flor. and Trident. Sess. 7.
divine and invisible grace, instituted by Christ, that by it every man may
receive the grace of God and sanctification.

And therefore they are not every manner of signs that are called the
Sacraments of the Church: but they are most certain holy, and effectual
signs commended unto Christians, by Gods own institution and promise.

Signs Aug. ep. 23. et de catech. rud. c. 26.
they are; in that, that by a certain external form and similitude they do
represent and declare unto us that, which God by them works in us invisibly
and spiritually.

Certain Aug. in Psa. 73. et 77 and l. 19. cont. Faust. c. 11. 13. and 16.
they are, and most holy and effectual signs: because that look what grace
they signify; they do also infallibly contain and cause the same to our
sanctification. For the Sacraments for their own parts (as S. CYPRIAN ser. de
caena. dom.
speaks) can not be void of that force and virtue that is proper unto them;
nether does the majesty of God by any means absent it self from the
mysteries, though they Aug. l. 3. cont. Dona. c. 10. et l. 5. c. 20.
be ministered even by wicked and unworthy persons.

As, for example, in the Sacrament of Baptism, the exterior washing, that
cleanses the filthes of the body; is an effectual sign and token of the
interior Tit. 3, 5. To. 6, 3.7. 1. Cor. 6, 11. Tertul. in l. de resur. c. 8.
washing: as giving an infallible testimony, that the soul is spiritually
purified and cleansed. So also other visible and external things, as oil, and
the forms of bread and wine, the use whereof is necessary in the Sacraments:
are fitly appointed unto us, both to signify and also to yield unto man the
grace of God and the health of his soul; so that he come not Prosp. senten. ex
Aug. in Ps. 142.
unworthily thereunto.

For by Baptism Conc. Flor. Io. 3, 5 Tit. 3, 5. Act. 8, 17. et 1, 8. Luc. 2^,
49. Io. 6, 51.55.58. et 20, 23.
we are regenerated and renewed: by confirmation, we are increased and
strengthened: by the holy Eucharist we are nourished and refreshed: by penance
we are restored and healed in the spiritual life: in which we are by the rest
of the Sacraments in like manner according to the nature and quality of each
of them, helped and abettered, as we will show hereafter in their due places.

4 Of what parts does every Sacrament consist?

OF the Word Conc. Flor. Aug. Tract. 80. in Joan.
and the Element. By the Word in this place understand some certain
determinate words, wherein the very form, as they call it, of the Sacrament
does consist. And by the Elemente, conceive such external things, as are the
very matter of the Sacraments, as water, oil, bread, wine, and the like.

Now, to these parts exactly taken are the rest of those things annexed which
do belong to the fit ministering and worthy receiving of every Sacrament: to
wit the institution of God: a convenient Trid. Ses. 7. can. 10. and 11. de
Sacramentis in genere item Florentin.
minister: a right intention in the minister: faith in the receiver: and
whatsoever else of like sort.

5 How many Sacraments be there?

Seven: Conc. Flor. and Constant. sess. 15. and Trid. sess. 7. can. 1.
which the Church being the Spouse Cant. 4, 9 1. Tim. 3, 15
of Christ and Pillar of truth, having by the Apostles received the^ from
Christ himself: has always hitherto kept and faithfully dispensed. And they
are these: Mat. 28, 19. Act. 8, 17 Mat. 26, 26. Io. 20, 23. Iac. 5, 14. 1. Tim.
4, 14 Ephesians. 5, 32.
Baptism, Confirmation, the Blessed Sacrament of the Eucharist, Penance,
Extreme unction, Order, and Matrimony. Neither truly forces it at all, if
such names be not all of them extant in the Scriptures, so that the matter it
self be evident, and the verity and virtue of the Sacraments be approved by
divine testimony. Albeit such Aug. l. 4. con. Donat. c. 24. et l. 2. c. 7. et
l. 5. c. 23. et ep. 118. c. 1. Chryso. in 2. ad These hom. 4.
things as by the Apostles Tradition the universal Church holds, and
comme^deth to be kept and observed; though they be not to be found in
Scripture: yet do they deserve of us full and perfect credit: as has bin
already declared. And touching the institution of every Sacrament in
particular, we will speak herafter in their proper places.

But the force and virtue of them (as the most faithful interpretour of the
Scripture, Saint AUGUSTINE, l. 19. cont. Faust. c. 11. et 16. et trac. 80. in
Joan.
says:) is of unspeakable value, and therefore the contemnours of it are
sacrilegious. For impiously certes is that despised, without the which no
piety can be perfited. And as the same holy Father teaches in an other Super
Leuit. q. 84. et l. 32. cont. Faust. c. 14.
place: the contemnour of the visible Sacrament can never be inuisibly
sanctified

6 Why were the Sacraments instituted?

FIrst, that they may be very present remedies against sin, which is a
pestilent disease of the Sap. 16, 14. Eccli. 21 2. To. 6, 23
soul, and except it be cured in this life: bringethe everlasting damnation.
And therefore these do far Florent. Conc. Trid. Sess. 7. can. 2. et 4. de Sacr.
in genere
excel the Sacraments of the old law, as being in virtue; greater: in
commodity; more profitable: in number; fewer: in the co^ceiuing of the^; more
honorable: in observation; more easy: in signification; more excellent: which
besides their signification, do also sanctify and give salvation, as S.
AUGUSTINE has very well l. 19. co^t. Faust. c. 13. l. 3. de doct. Christ. c.
19. ep. 118. c. 1.
gathered out of the Scriptures.

Secondly, that we may have some certain and effectual signs of Gods grace
and good will toward us, which signs, whilst they represent themselves to
the outward senses, they do not only stir up our faith in Christ, and in the
mercy To. 9, 23.
and goodness of almighty God: but are moreouerliuely instruments, by which it
has seemed good unto Almighty God effectually to work Tit 3, 5. Io. 6, 58.
et 20, 23.
our salvation. So that it was notably said of an Aug. l. 4. cont. Dona. c. 24.
ancient Father, that a Sacrament even by it self alone is of an inestimable
value.

Thirdly, that there may be some tokens, Aug. l. 19 con. Faust. c. 11. et c.
17. de vera reli. Bas. ho. 13. in exhort. ad Bapt.
and as it were external marks of Christian profession, whereby the Children
of God and of the Church may mutually know one another: and that they may
fruitfully exercise and keep themselves in unity, humility, and obedience, and
so remain lincked amongst themselves, with the necessary bond and league of
one Religion. Otherwise without Sacraments can not any sort of Religion
either stand or be sufficiently discerned.

7 And what is to be thought of the ministers of the Sacraments?

WE must so esteem them, as the 1. Cor. 4, 1.
ministers of Christ, and the dispensors of the mysteries of God, that do
bear Esa. 52, 11. Number. 1, 50.51. 3. Reg. 8, 4.
the vessels of our Lord, and serve the Tabernacle, and that by profession
have authority in holy things, and with a certain right and title do
minister the same. For not to all Numb. 16, 39. 2. Reg. 6, 6. 2. par. 26, 16.
Conc. Nic. cann. 14. Trid. Sess. 7. de Sacr. in genere. can. 10.
indifferently, but to Priests and Bishops does it belong, and it was by God
himself enioined, to consecrate, dispense and minister the holy Sacraments.

And that we may not think that the 1. Cor. 1, 13. et 3, 4. Conc. Trid. Sess.
7. can. 12. Nazia^. orat. 40. in Sanct. Bap.
Sacraments do any whit depend upon the life and honesty of those that do
minister them, S. AUGUSTINE Cont. Cresco. l. 4. c. 20. et l. 4. co^. Donat. c.
4.
has prescribed us this rule: Sacraments, (says he) are not therefore more
true and more holy, because they are ministered by a better man: for they of
themselves are true and holy, by means of the true and holy God whose
Sacraments they are. And again: Remember Con. lit. Petill. l. 2. c. 47. et
tract. 5 in Euang. Joan.
that the manners of evil men do nothing hinder the Sacraments of God, to
make them either nothing at all, or ever the less holy. To which accords
that sentence of de iis qui mysteriis initiantur. c. 5.
S. AMBROSE: do thou not regard the merits of the persons, but the offices of
the Priests: I mean in the administration of the Sacraments. For even by the
Io. 11, 50 Mat. 23, 2.
unworthy, God accustometh to work, and by the life of the Priest, there can
be no prejudice, to the grace of the Sacrament: as witnesses ho. 8. in 1. Corinthians.
S. CHRYSOSTOM.

8 What conceipte ought we to have of Ceremonies, those espeacially, that are
ordinarily and solempnly used in the Sacraments?

CEremonies approved by the Church, are certain external Io. 9, 6. et 11,
33.43. and 20, 22. Luc. vlt. 50. Mar. 7, 33. et 8, 23. et 10, 16. Mat. 8, 3. et
14, 19.
rites, religiously and decently instituted: first, that they may be signs,
testimonies, and exercises of the interior worshipe, which Io. 4, 23. Mat. 15,
8. Esa. 1, 14.
God principally requires at our hands.

Then, that there may be some lively and forcible prouocations unto Religion,
whereby the frailty of man, may be fortified and underpropped, and as it were
trained with the hand both to receive and also to retain holy mysteries.

Lastly, that those things which do appertain to the aduanceme^t of Gods
service, and to the preservation of public discipline and Leo. ep. 81. ad
Dios. Innoc. ad Decent. ep. 1. Conc. 4. Tol. can. 2.
concord; may be prosecuted in the Church, after an honest comely and decent
1. Cor. 14 40. Phil. 4, 5.8.
order, as the Apostle wills.

But those ceremonies speacially which are used in the administration of the
Sacraments, and which we have received Hier. 6, 16. Pro. 22, 28.
of the Fathers, Bas. de Spir. Sanct. c 27. Triden. Conc. can. 13. de Sacr.
delivered and commended unto us as it were by hand: ought with great
diligence to be kept and observed. For besides that they bring a decency unto
the Sacraments, and engender a certain reverence: they are also venerable
unto us by a singular commendation of Tert. de Cor. mil. c. 3 Dionis. de Eccle.
hierar. per totum.
antiquity.

Then besides their institution most ancient and Apostolical, they have
plenty of mysteries full of gravity and dignity: as most holy and learned
Amb. de initiand. mist. August. and alii passim. vide Isid de off. Eccle.
Fathers, have noted. Finally, concerning these things and others of the like
tenor, it is an excellent saying of in ser. de defunctis.
DAMASCEN: Those things which Christian Religion, most free from all error,
does admit and embrace, and for so many ages together keep untouched: are not
vain, but profitable, pleasing to God, and much auailable to our salvation.

True it is, that the Sectaries laugh at the ceremonies used in the
Sacraments: but themselves are indeed more to be laughed at, or rather
bewailed, in that, trusting unto their blind judgment and mortal hatred, two
pernicious Counsailours: they do wage battle, against the most clear and
evident truth. Surely of the ceremonies of Baptism, even the most ancient
Divines do witness unto us: Dion. c. 2 Eccle. hier.
S. DENIS, S. CLEMENT, Clemen. ep. 3.
TERTVLLIAN, Tert. de cor. mil. c. 3.
ORIGIN, Origin. ho. 12. in Number.
S. CIPRIAN, Cypria^. ep. 70.
S. BASIL, Basil. de spir. Sanct. c. 27.
Saint. CHRYSOSTOM, Chrysos. ho. de Adam. et Eua.
S. CYRILL Cyril. Hiero. Catech. mist. 1. 2. 3. 4.
.

Let the wicked scoff and blaspheme never so much: those Fathers certainly
with one consent do commend Abrenuntiatio^, Exorcismes, holy Water, holy
Chrisme, and the sign of the Cross. Almost twelve hundred years agone, wrote
Saint BASIL Bas. ibid. vid. Rabanu^ de inst. cler. li. 1. c. 27, 28. et Isid.
l. 2. de off. cap. 20. Amb. l. 1. 2. 3. de Sa ra. and de iis qui mysti
initiantur. Aug. l. 1. de nupt. c. 20. and l. 2. c. 18. and 29. and l. 4 de
symb. ad catech. c. 1
in this manner: We do consecrate the water of Baptism, and the oil of
unction, and him also that receives Baptism.

But to give particular admonition of the ceremonies that are annexed unto all
the Sacraments, as it would be very long: so is it also very difficulte, and
to this our purpose not needful.

Yea, ORIGIN does plainly confess: that in such ecclesiastical Hom. 5. in
Number. Dion. c. 1. et vlt. de hier. Eccle. Aug. lib de doct. Christ. ca. 9.
obseruances, there are many things which of necessitye all must do: but the
reason of the^, why they are so done, is not yet sufficiently known.

OF THE SACRAMENT OF BAPTISM.
1 What is Baptism, and is it necessary to all?

THis is the first, Act 2, 38. Mar. 16, 16. Io 3.22. and 4.1 Tit 3, 5. Mat. 28,
19. Ephesians 5, 26. 1. Pet. 3, 21.
and most necessary Sacrament of the new law, consisting in the outward washing
of the body, and the due pronuntiation of the words, according unto the
institution of Christ.

A necessary Sacrament, I say, not only for those Trid. sess. 6. c 4. and sess.
7. can. 5. de Baptismo. Aug. tract. 13. in Joan. Amb. de mister. initi. c. 4

wrath; and therefore even Infantes also have need to be purged from sin,
neither can they be cleansed and regenerated into the children of God, without
this Aug. ep. 28. and l. 3. de anima. and eius orig. c. 9 Item. l. 1. de pec.

Sacrament. For generally has the Lawmaker proclaimed, that, Io. 3, 5. Aug.

2 What things are principally to be noted about this Sacrament?

THe Element that washes, and the signification thereof, the word, the
Minister, and the effect of Baptism. The Element is simple Io. 3, 5. Ephesians. 5,
26. Act. 8, 36. and 10, 47. Trid. c. 2. de Bapt. et Flor Chry. hom. 24. in Joan.
water, the matter very necessary h reu^to, which is naturally wont to wash
away the filthes of the body. To which very aptly does answer this
signification: that by Baptism the soul is Tit. 3, 5. Act. 2, 38. 1. Cor. 6,
11.
cleansed from sin, and the man made just, as we mean to show hereafter.

The Word, wherein consists the form of the Con Latera^. and Flor. Aug. l.

And although it be properly the office of Priests to Baptize, yet where there

also may Baptize; yea though they be wicked persons and Heretics, so that
they go not from the manner of the Church, and Her usual words.

3 What profit and effect does Baptism yield?

THat doubtless which by the teaching of Christ, and Mar. 16, 16. Act. 2, 38.

testimony of the Apostles S. PETER, and S. PAVL, we learn: to wit, that by
Baptism both sins are remitted, and the Spirit is given, whereby both the old
man is extinguished, and a new creature is made in Christ. For Baptism rightly
received does not only yield this, that al sins be fully pardoned and taken
away from the wicked man: but also that he being once baptized, is perfitly
renewed, and made truly innocent, just, holy, and worthy in Christ of the
heavenly glory. So that S. PAVL has justly said to al those that are Baptized:
You are 1. Cor. 6, 11. Amb. l. 1 de Sacr. c. 4. conc. Flor. and Trid. ses. 5.
can. 5.
washed, you are sanctified, you are justified in the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ, and in the spirit of our God. And in an other place Tit. 3, 5. Aug.

he testifies, that Baptism is the lauer of regeneration, and of renouation
of the holye-Ghoste: the Ephesians. 5, 26.
lauer also of water in the word of life. And again he writes: As Gal. 3, 27
To. 6, 3.
many of you as are Baptized in Christ, have put on Christ.

Very fitly and briefly does Ser. in caena Do. vide Cyprian. de bapt. Christ

S. BERNARD comprise the principal effects of this Sacrament, We are washed in
Baptism, says he, because the handwriting of our damnation is ca^celed: and
this grace is bestowed upon us: that now concupiscence cannot hurt us, yet so,
that we keep our selves from consent.

Which Iac. 1, 14. To. 6, 12. and 7, 7. Trid. ses 5. ca^. 5. Aug. l. 1. de

concupiscence remaining in the regenerate, is not of it self a sin, but an
inclination unto sin, (Fomes peccati) as the Divines do call it; left us Ad
agonem to strive withal, that the Baptized by this occasion may more
watchefully seek Gods grace, and more fervently practice virtue, and more
valiantly striueing get themselves a greater crown. Therefore as S. PAVL
teaches. There To. 8, 1.
is no damnation to them that are in Christ Jesus: that walk not according to
the flesh, but according to the spirit: and that Col. 3, 9. Ephesians. 4, 22.

are renewed from day to day according to the inward 2. Cor. 4, 16.
man: which is indeed the very property of the To. 6, 4.
baptized.

4 What does the benefit received of so great a Sacrament require at our
hands?

FIrst it requires of us a special and continual gratitude of mind, that we
may praise, love, and extol him, Tit. 3, 5.
Who according to his mercy has saved us by the lauer of regeneration, and
renouation of the Holy Ghost, whom he has powered upon us abundantly by Jesus
Christ our Savior: that being justified by his grace, we may be heirs
according to hope of life everlasting.

Then so is the mystery of this Sacrament to be Orig. 1. in Numeros.
remembered, that every man do oftentimes admonish himself of that notable
promise, and Christian profession, which by his Dionys. Areop. ca. 7. Eccl.

consider, that of the child of Wrath, and slave of Satan, he there was made

Be mindful of thy speech, and never let the process of thy obligation
depart out of thy remembrance. And it is an excellent speech of S. PAVL,
exhorting all those that are Baptized: To. 6, 3. Gal. 3, 27. Aug. de fide and
operibus cap. 26.
Are you ignorant that all we which are Baptized in Christ Jesus, in his death
we are baptized? For we are buried together with him by Baptism into death;
that as Christ is risen from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also
may walk in the newenesse of life.

OF THE SACRAMENT OF CONFIRMATION.
1 Which is the other Sacrmente next unto Baptism?

COnfirmation: which is a Sacrament of the new Law, as sacred and holy, says

S. AUGUSTINE, as Baptism it self: which is ministered unto the Baptized, with
the impositio^ of the hands of a Bishop, and the anointing with holy Chrisme.

2 What warrant have we to use this Sacrament?

IT has the testimony of divine Scripture, according to the uniform sentence
and interpretation of the Fathers, and the Cyp. l. 1. ep. 12. Aug. lib. 5.
cont. Dona. cap. 19. and 20. item. tract. 6. in ep. Joan.
Church. For hereunto belongs that which Act. 8, 17. and 19, 5. Cypr. ad
Iubaian.
S. LVKE the Evangelist, not once writes of the Apostles, that laid their
hands upon the Baptized, using this visible sign, ordained by God himself;
because a new and more plentiful grace of the Holy Ghost was given to those
which were newborn in Christ. And therefore when the Apostles laid hands upon
them, they received, as S. LVKE records of those Ibidem.
Baptized, the holy Ghost, to wit, with a certain increase and abundance
of spiritual grace.

But at this time, whereas the Bishops do bear the room, and possess the
place of the Apostles: God does not defraud his Church, of this so wholesome a
grace: but by the same Bishops Hier. co^t. Lucif. cap. 4.
in this Sacrament woorketh effectually: so that as sermon. de unction
Chrismatis.
testifies S. CYPRIAN, The verity is joined with the sign; and the spirit is
present in the Sacrament.

And hereunto does appertain that Canon of the Church, of old set down:
Urban. Pont. et Martyr. qui. anno 227. vixit in ep. ad omnes Christianos.
All the faithful ought to receive the Holy Ghost after Baptism by the
imposition of hands from a Bishop, that they may be found perfect
Christians: because when the Holy Ghost is infused, the faithful heart is
dilated to prudence and constancy.

3 What things are necessary for the perfection of this Sacrament?

THree things are specially required thereunto: the proper matter of the
Sacrament, the due form of words, and a convenient Minister.

The matter is compound of Oil and Conc. Braccar. c. 4. Cypr. de unction.
Chris. Greg. in 1. c Cant. Fab, and Con Flo.
Baulme, which being consecrated by a Bishop, has now of old obtained the
name of holy Cypr. vt supra and l. 1. ep. 12. Bas. de spir. sa^ c. 27. Fab qui
vixit anno. 241. ep 2.
Chrisme, and in this Sacrament is, after a solemn manner laid upon the
forehead.

The prescripte form of words is this; Con Flo. 2. Cor. 1, 21. Ephesians. 1, 13.
I do sign thee with the sign of the Cross, and confirm thee with the
Chrisme of salvation, In the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the
holy Ghost.

The Minister of this Sacrament is a Bishop only; that the example, form, and
Tradition of the Act. 8, 14 Clem ep. 4. Vrba^ Melc. Damasc. ep. 4. Leo. epi.
88. ad episc. Ger. and Gall. Conc. Worcester. Flor. and Tri.
Apostles may be kept. Of which thing we have received a decree set down of
old in this manner: Eus. Pon. and Mart. ep. ad Episcop. Tusc. and Ca^pan.
Innoc. c. 1 ep 1. ad Decent. c. 3.
The Sacrament of imposition of hands, is to be had in great reverence which
cannot be done by any other, but by the high Priests: neither is it read, or
known to have been done by any other in the Apostles time, but by the Act 8,
14. and 19, 6.
Apostles themselves.

4 And why are the Baptized, anointed with holy Chrisme?

BEcause that by the instincte of the Holy Ghost, Bas. de spir. san. cap. 27.
the Apostles have so delivered unto us, as Epi. 4. ad Iulium and Julian.
S. CLEMENT, and De eccle. hier. c. 4. and 2
S. DENIS, the disciples of S. PETER, and S. PAVL do prove, and they delivered
that doubtless, concerning the hallowing of Chrisme, which they had received
of our Lord himself: as is thereof a grave witness, In ep. ad Orientales Episc.
FABIANVS, who was both a Martyr of Christ, and high Bishop of the Church.

Also, there is extant of this matter, such a precept of a most holy Synod.
Laod. can. 48. Corn. ad Fab. Antioc. apud Eusebius. l. 6. hist. c. 35. Theodor. de
haer. Fabul. in Nouat.
Synod: The Baptized after Baptism must receive the most holy Chrism, and be
made partakers of the kingdom of heaven. Saint CYPRIAN alleges, l. 1. ep.
1^. and de vncti. Chrismat. Cyril. l. 9. in Leuit Cyril. Hier. catech. 3. mist.
this reason: that a Christian having once received Chrisme, to wit, Unction,
or Anointing; may be the anointed of God, and have in him the grace of
Christ, and continually maintain holiness.

And this visible Ointme^t, wherewith the Church does anoint the Baptized, as
l. 15. de Trinit. ca. 26. Pacianus Barcilonen. de Baptis. et ep. 1 ad sympron.
S. AUGUSTINE teaches, does signify the gift of invisible grace: wherewith
the holy Ghost does with his internal Unction replenishe and confirm, Christ
principally, who took his name of in sente^tiis Prosper. 342. ex. Aug tract.
33. in Io. and ser. 47. de verb. Do. Rab. l 1 c. 30 Isid. l. 2. c. 25
Chrisme, and then in like sort al Christians. Whereupon l. de carnis

Optat. etc. Council. Romans sub Siluest. Ite^ 2. 3. and 4. Carthag. 2. Tol. 1.
Vasinse, Trid.
TERTVLLIAN, very fitly, alluding as it were to the nature of Oil, has
written of this Sacrament in this manner. The flesh is anointed; that the
Soul may be consecrated: the flesh is signed; that the Soul may be fensed:
the flesh by imposition of hands, is ouershadowed; that the Soul by the
spirit may be illuminated. By which it is evident, that they which reject
holy Chrisme, do greatly bewray their own ignorance and folly: as manifestly
denying, the most ancient ordinance of the Apostles, and rashely condemning
the continual custom and Tradition of the Church.

5 What is the use and commodity of this Sacrament?

IN Baptism we are Io. 3, 5. Melch. ad Hisp. Episc. Conc. Flor. Petr. Clun.
lib. 6. ep. 1.
regenerate unto life; after Baptism in this Sacrament, we are strengthened
unto combat. In Baptism we are washed: by this after Baptism, we are
strengthened: that the Holy Ghost may be always present with the regenerate, as
a keeper, and a comforter, and a tutor. This is the Doctrine of that holy high
Bishop and Martyr MELCHIADES. And hereunto agrees that which Ep. 4. ad Iulium.
Amb. l. 3. de Sacram. c. 2. and de iis qui initiant. mysteriis cap. 7.
S. CLEMENT testifies he received of the Apostles themselves: When any man
has been regenerate by water, let him be afterward confirmed by a Bishop
with the seauenfoulde grace of the Holy Ghost: because otherwise he can never
be a perfect Christian. This Dion. de Eccles. hierarc. cap. 2.
Sacrament therefore profits in marvelous manner, that they which are by
regeneration entered in the mysteries of Faith, as 1. Pet. 2, 2
Infants newe-borne, and as yet weak and feeble, may wax greater in grows,
and be strengthened in Christ.

These, as it were nouices in christian warfare, the Bishop admonishes in
anointing, that against so many enemies and daily dangers, they must be
confirmed, Psalm. 50, 14.
Spiritu principali, with a principal Spirit. He signeth with the Cross Aug.
in Psalm. 141. Luc. 9.26. Mat. 10, 33. 1. Pet. 2, 20. Luc. 21.15. Mat. 5, 39.
Act. 4, 13.31 and 5, 29.41.
their foreheade, which is the seat of shamefastness, that they may
constantly, and without fear, confess the name of our Lord. He gives them
also a blow on the cheek; that they may always remember, how they must with
invincible patience perform and finishe their Christian warfare.

OF THE SACRAMENT OF THE EVCHARIST.
1 What does the name of the Eucharist signify?

THis one name does betoken that high, and Dion. Eccles. hier. cap. 2. and 3.
Conc. Trid. sess. 13. cap. 2. and 3.
most blessed Sacrament, than the which, the Church has nothing more
honorable, more wonderful, more effectual, or wholesome.

And it is doubtless very worthelie called the Eucharist, that is, Amb. l. 5
de sacra. c. 3. Cyp. de lapsis. Orig. co^. Cells. lib. 8.
good grace, or thanksgiving; because it contains the principal and
greatest Chry. ho. 6^. ad pop. and 83. in Mat. and 45. in Io and 61. ad pop. Ant
gift of God, yea and the very fountain and author himself of al grace: and
it admonishes us of those special good things, for the receipt whereof we do
owe thanksgiving, praise, and most sovereign glory to the supreme majesty of
almighty God. For we could not have wished a greater benefit, than that
Christ Jesus our Lord, borne of the Virgin MARY, Crucified, and Chry. l. 3. de
sacerd. and ho. 2. ad pop Ant. and ho. 3. ad Ephesians.
assumpted into glory, should so give himself wholly unto us; that even now
at this present we truly receive his Body and Blood, and are wholly Cyril in

incorporated unto him by this divine Sacrament.

2 What things are speacially contained in this Sacrament?

THree Cyr. Hieros. cat. 4. mist.
things are comprehended in the holy Eucharist, the visible forms, the truth
Mat. 26, 26. Mar. 14.22. Luc. 22.19. 1 Cor. 11, 24
of the body and blood of our Lord, and the effect of spiritual grace.

For that which appears unto our eyes, are Theoph. in 14. Mat. and in Mat.
26. and in Io. 6. Cyril. ad Calos. Amb l. 4. de sacr. c. 4. and li. 6. c. 1.
visible forms, to wit, of bread and wine. But that which under those
fourmes, our faith, and not Damasc. li. 4. cap. 14.
our sense and reason does apprehend: that is the true body and blood of Christ
our Savior. And that which by participation of this Sacrament, we get, is a
certain Aug. tr^. 26. in Io. and alii postea citandi.
singular grace of the holy Ghost; to wit, the wholesome fruit and effect of
the Eucharist, as we will show hereafter.

3 Which are the chief points necessary to be known touching this Sacrament?

THere are five, that do principally require the handling: The first
concerning the truth of the Eucharist. The second touching the
transubstantiation of bread and wine. The third of the worship and adoration of
the same. The fourth, of the ohlation and Sacrifice thereof. The last of the
receiving of the same under one or both kind. For of these inspeacial, it is
very profitable in these our days, to have perfect knowledge and
understanding.

4 What therefore is to be believed touching the verity of the Eucharist?

THis surely, that against all Ioa^. 6. and ibide^ Cyril. Aug. tract. 27. in
Joan. Cypr. de caena Do. Pet. Clu^. l. 1. ep. 2
Capharnaites, we do with the wholl Church assuredly believe; that under the
forms of bread and wine, the very true Conc. Ephesians. Nic. 2. act. 6. Later. c 1.

flesh of Jesus Christ, and his true blood is given in the Eucharist: by the
ministry certes of the Priest; but by the power and omnipotency of our Lord
Jesus Christ, with whom any word is not Luc. 1. Mar. 10.

spoke, and they were made: he commanded and they were created. And he said
in that supper which was prepared the day before his passion, when he had
taken the bread first, and then the Luc. 22, Mar. 14, Mat. 26, 1, Cor. 11,

l. 5. co^t. Marc. cap. 8.
Chalice into his hands, and when his meaning was to assure every man both of
the institution of this Sacrament and also of the truth thereof: he, I say,
most plainly and expressly said: Luc. 22,
This is my body which is given for you. he said, This Mar. 14, Mat. 26.
is my blood that shall be shed for many. Concerning which institution he said
also before: Joan. 6, vide Hill. 8. de Trin. Cyr. in. Io. l. 4. c. 16. Orig. ho.

shall live for ever: Ibidem. vide Cyril. l. 4. c. 12. and Theoph. in cap. 6.
Io. and in 14. Mar. Pet. Clun. l. 1. ep. 2.
and the bread which I will give is my flesh, for the life of the world.
Neither are other testimonies of the Evangelists, and the Apostle S. PAVL 1.
Cor. 10 16. and 11, 13
obscure or hard to be known: which do evidently avouch this faith unto us,
that no man may doubt, Epip. in Ancorato. Cyr. catech. 4. mist. Chry. ho. 83 in
Mat. Leo. ser. 6. de ieiun. septimi mensis.
but that Christ, according both to his divine and humane nature, is wholly in
the Eucharist, and does remain with us even to the end of the Mat. 28. Conc.

world.

Therefore Aug. in Ps 98. and 33. Pros. de promis. p. 2. c. 25
we have and do receive in the Churches the very same flesh of Christ, that
was Chrysostom. ho. 2. in 2. Tim. and 24. in 1. Cor. and apud Damasc. lib. 2.
Parall. c. 50. Presbyteri Achaiae in hist. S. Andr.
seen in times past, in Palestine present with men. But the same here in this
place is neither apparent unto the senses, nor subject to any transmutation
and corruption: as being invisible, impassible, immortal, shining with most
excellent and divine glory: which at this time we can not any otherwise
behold then with the eyes of faith, but the Saints in heaven do clearly
see, with wonderful delight and pleasure. And notwithstanding this, there be
yet certain sacramentaries (O horrible and often Synod. 2 Nicen. act. 6. tom.
3. Romans Vercell. sub Leone 9. Turon. sub Victor. 2. Romans sub Nicolao 2. Romans

condemned impiety) who, whilst they can not reach with their senses, this
mystery more to be adored, then searched: they dare even to deny the same,
marueilously deprauing the words of the Gospel, although most plain and
evident. Which indeed is nothing else; but even as it were to take the sun
out of the world: and to spoil Gods spouse the Church of the most precious
treasure of her true lover: and to bereave the faithful of the bread of life:
that there may be nothing at all whereby their poor banished souls may be
fed and sustained in the deserte of this world.

5 And what is to be thought touching Transubstantiation?

TWo things are here principally to be considered, and plainly professed:
the one is; that the Priest, who consecrateth Con. Later. cap. 1. Chrysostom. lib.
3. de sacerd. Hier. ad Heliod. ep. 1. ca. 7. and 85. ad Euag.
the Eucharist, must be lawfully ordered: the other is, that there is so much
force and efficacy in those mystical and consecratory Just. Apo 2. Iren. l. 5.

A very wonderful transmutation indeed, and to be measured only by faith,
which is brought to pass by the omnipotent power of Christ working by those
very words: and it is not without cause called by the holy Catholic Church
Transubstantiation, Con. Later. c. 1. Trid. ses. 13. c. 4. and can. 2. Romans

because the substance of bread and wine is most certainly converted into the
body and blood of Christ. For if the speech of ELIAS were of such force to
cause fire to come from heaven, shall not the speech of Christ (for this
collection has S. AMBROSE Ambr. de iis qui mist, init. c. 9. and l. 4. de sac.
c. 4.
made) be of force to change the substance of the Elements? of the works of the
wholl world thou have read: he Ps. 148, 5.
spoke and they were made: he commanded and they were created. The speech
therefore of Christ, which was able to make of nothing that which was not
before; is it not able to change those things which are already, into that
which they were not? for it is no less to give new natures to things, then to
change natures. And there is nothing more evident then the speech of Christ,
saying Mat. 26, 26. Mar. 14, 22. and ibid. Theoph. in 6. cap. Joan. Greg. Nyss.
orat. catech. c. 37. Guit. mund. lib. 3.
this is my body; this is my blood, in so much as there is no place at all
left of suspicion, that after consecration there is bread and wine remaining in
the Eucharist.

6 Ought we to reverence and adore this Sacrament?

undoubtedly, for so does the office of religion require at our hands, that we
creatures do give unto our Creator, and servants unto our Lord and Redemer
most mighty and sovereign, whom we believe to be present in the Eucharist:
the honor and worship due unto him.

For of him the Scripture Heb. 1, 6. Psalm. 96, 8.
it self pronounces: Let all the Angels of God adore him. And again: All the
Kings of the earth shall Psalm. 71, 81.
adore him, all nations shall serve him. Then the divine Prophet in an other
place, when he does contemplate this Sacrament and the greatness thereof,
thincketh it not enough to say; the poor shall Ps. 21, 27 Vide ibide^ Euthym.
Eusebius. in catena. Aug exposit. 1. and ep. 120. ad Honor. cap. 24. and 27.
eat and shall be satisfied, and shall praise our Lord: but he adds this
also: all the families of nations shall adore in his sight. And again all
those which are fat of the earth have eaten and adored.

The Sages, Mat. 2, 11. Chry. ho. 24. in 1. Cor. and ho. 8. in Mat. Joan. 9,
38. Mat. 14, 33. and 9, 18. and 28, 17. Luc. 24, 52.
and some other like are commended by the Evangelists, because they exhibited
divine honor unto Christ being yet in mortal flesh, falling down before him
and adoring him. But now have we the same Christ in the Eucharist: not To. 6,
9. Psalm. 94, 3.
mortal but immortal, wonderful in glory and marvelous in might and power.
And this faith do we justly give testimony of, with a religious worship both

7 What then must be our belief, concerning the Sacrifice of the Altar?

THis undoubtedly, that the Eucharist is not instituted only to that end, that
Christians may receive the same as an wholesome food; whereupon it is called Io.

it has now of old, obtained the name of an host, a Sacrifice, an oblation

And it is offered for a continual memory and thanksgiving for the Chry. ho.

of the Mass if we weigh the whole matter uprightly, is in truth a certain
holy and lively representation, and also an unbloody and effectual oblation of
our Lords Passion and of that bloody Sacrifice, which was offered for us upon
the Cross.

Whereby first it comes to pass, that a lively memory, faith, and gratitude
from us toward our Redemer, is daily stirred up and confirmed, according to
that; Do this Luc. 22, 19. 1. Cor. 11, 24.
for a commemoration of me. Of which words, the Church has been such a

Vestiments, Vessels, Ceremonies, and al manner of actions: that the standers
by may have nothing else to behold, but that holy commemoration: and the
majesty of so great a Sacrifice may be the more set forth: and the minds of
the faithful, by means of these exterior signs and helps, more easilye
lifted up, and as it were lead with the hand to the meditation of Heavenly
things, which do lie hid in this Sacrifice.

Also hereby it comes to pass, that the fruit of the oblation of Christ
made upon the Cross, and of our Redemption may be applied unto us, and to all
the faithful as well alive as Cypr. ep. 66. Chrysostom. ho. 41. in 1. Cor. and 21.

Apostle S. PETER, writes thus: That which the Jews upon envy did sacrifice,
thinking thereby to blot out his name upon earth: that same do we for our
salvation offer upon a sanctified Altar, knowing well that by this only remedy
life is given unto us, and death put to flight. We omit other Fathers,
witnesses of the same faith and doctrine, that we may keep that brevity that
we purposed in the beginning.

By all which things it is apparently evident, that Christ two sundry ways is
called and is in deed for us a Sacrifice: to wit after a bloody, and Conc.
Ephesians. in ep. ad Nest. 2. Synod. Nic. act. 6. tom. 3 Aug. contr. Faust. l. 20.

an unbloody manner. For he offered Ephesians. 5.2. Heb. 10, 14.
himself a bloody sacrifice for us upon the Cross, that unto the tipe of the
Pascall Lamb, which was offered Ex. 12, 3. Mar. 14, 12.
among the Jews; he the true Lamb without spot, the very truth unto the
figure, might answer. But at the last supper, Eusebius. l. idem ca. 10. Naz.
orat. 4. and in carm. ad Episc. and ad Consta^tinop. Nyss. orat. 1. in resur.
Christ.
as also upon the Altar, his pleasure was, that the same should be offered,
after a manner and ceremony unbloody, even as S. CYRIL Ep. 10. ad Nest. and
interp. Anat. 11
calls it: to the intent that the oblation of Genesis 14, 18. Heb. 7, 1 Psalm.

Melchizedech, who offered bread and wine, might be made perfect; and he
remain true Priest according to the order of Melchizedech, and his Preisthood
continue forever, without any other to succeed in his room.

There, once Heb. 9, 25 and 10.14
and at one only place of Judea, he offered his Sacrifice; whereof S. PAVL
writing unto the Hebrews does discourse: but here he is sacrificed Chry. ho 17.
ad Heb. Aug. ep. 23. Theo. in ca. 5 7. 10. ad Heb. item Oecum. and Photius.
more often, and in every place, to wit all over the Church: as it is confirmed
by the Mal. 1, 11
Prophet MALACHIE. There he was offered unto death: and here for a perpetual
and lively remembrance of his death, and Pet. Clu^. lib. 1. ep. 2.
an wholesome participatio^ thereof, which flows from thence, as it were, from
the head unto the members; to the intent that the fruit and effect of that
sacrifice offered upon the cross might be daily exhibited and applied unto
us, by this sacrifice of the Mass.

8 Is the Eucharist to be received under one kind only, as of bread, or under
both kinds of bread and wine?

FOR as much as belongethe to Priests, or those that sacrifice; it is manifest
that they must receive the Sacrament under both kinds: whereas otherwise, they
cannot orderly either consecrate, or offer the Eucharist. The reason whereof
depending of the nature of the sacrifice it self; there is no need to
allege in this place.

But concerning the rest of the faithful which do not themselves sacrifice,
we must thus much confess, that they are not bound by any divine commandment
to receive the Blessed Sacrament under both kinds, but that it is sufficient
for their salvation to communicate under one kind. For if we look into the
state of the primitive Church we shall find that it was ministered unto the
faithful sometime under one Tert. lib. 2. ad vxor. c. 5. Cyp. ser. 5. de
lapsis. Orig. ho. 13 in Exo. Bas. in ep. ad Caesaria^. Hier. apol. contr.
Iouin. cap. 6. Petr. Clun. l. 1. mirac. c. 1.
and sometime under both kinds. And if we go unto the holy Scripture; it does
in such 1. Cor. 10, 16. and 11, 26. Act. 2, 42.
manner speak of this Sacrament, that it uses to make mention sometime of the
bread and the cup; sometime of the bread only. For where we read: Unless
you Io. 6, 53. Ibid. verse, 51 Conc. Trid. sess, 21 c. 1.
eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood you shall not have
life in you: We read also: If any man eat of this bread he shall live
forever. And he which said; Ibi. ver. 54.
He that eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, has life everlasting: has
also said: The Ibid. 51.
bread which I will give, is my flesh, for the life of the world. And again
the same that affirmed: He Ibi. ver. 56.
that eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, abides in me and I in him:
affirmed this also: He Ibid. ver. 58.
that eats this bread, shall live forever. To omit, what S. LVKE Luc. 24,
30.35. Act. 2, 42. and 20, 7. and 27, 35. Aug. ep. 86. ad Casul. Chry. ho. 17
operis imperf. Isich. in Leuit. cap. 9.
alleges touching the breaking of bread only. Neither do we want the
example of Christ himself, who first at the last supper ordained this
Sacrament under Mat. 26, 26. Mar. 14, 22. Luc. 22, 19. 1. Cor. 11, 24.
both kinds, and delivered it unto his Apostles. But afterward being at Emaus
with his two disciples, he gave Luc. 24, 30. and ibid. Theoph. and Beda. Chry.
ho. 17. oper. imperf. Aug. li. 3. de cons. Euang cap. 25.
the^ the Eucharist under one kind only and immediately after withdrew himself
as the fathers do interpret this place of the Gospel.

we must not therefore condemn, either those, who contenting them selves with
one kind only, do abstain from the use of the cup; and are read to have
Eusebius. l. 6. hist. cap. 36. Aug. ho. 26. ex 50. and ser. 252. de te^p. Amb. in
Satyr. Pauli. in vita S. Amb. Amphil. in vita Basil. Beda. lib. 4. hist. c. 14.
and 24. Theod. in Philoth. in vita 26. quae est Simeonis. Euagr. l. 4. c. 3
Greg. Turo. li. 1. de glor. Martyr. c. 86 Gulielmus Abb. in vita S. Bernard.
lib. 1. ca. 11.
abstained many ages sithence: or those that of old, when so the Church did
allow; had in public use both kinds.

But use and experience the master of matters, has taught by little and little,
that for the more profit of the people, and less danger, and for many
respects it is very coueniently done, that the Chalice being left, the
communion under one kind only be retained. And thus has the Church long since
decreed to be done, not swaruing at all herein from the ordinance and
commandment of her spouse (for she is the Pillar and 1. Tim. 3, 15.
ground of truth, and a faithful dispensour 1. Cor. 4, 1
of the mysteries of God,) but employing that power which she has received of
her spouse in dispensing the mysteries to 2. Cor. 10, 8. and 13, 10. Conc.
Trid. ses. 21. cap. 2.
edification, and the common profit of the faithful, as the state and
condition of times and men, which enforces alteration even in sacred things,
does seem to require.

For the very words of the Gospel do Mat. 26, 20. Mar. 14, 17. Luc. 22, 14.
Just. in Apol. 2. ad Ant.
give us to understand, that Christ at his last supper dealt with those, unto
whom he gave commission not only to receive, but also to consecrate and offer
the Eucharist, yea and to direct and Act. 20, 28. 1. Pet. 5, 2. Luc. 10, 16.
Ephesians. 4, 11.14.
govern the whole Church. To the judgment, wisdom, and authority, of those
he left, to appoint laws unto posterity and according to the diversity of
times orderly to dispose, as well in most other things appertaining unto
Chrstian weal, as in the manner and order of communicating the Euchariste unto
the faithful.

This same 1. Cor. 11, 34.
even out of Saint PAVL, does S. AUGUSTINE Ad Ianua. ep. 118. cap. 6.
prove, and it may easily be convinced by many decrees of the Apostles.

Neither have we reason to think that the laitye have any wrong, if in this,
as also in most Mat. 18, 18. Io. 20, 23. 1. Tim. 3, 2.8.13. and 4, 14. Tit. 1,
5.
other things they be not made equal unto Priests. For it is most certain,
that Christ is not divided into two parts, according unto the two distinct
signs of this Sacrament; but that as well under one as under both kinds, yea
under a little Basil. ad Caesar. Cyr. ad Calos. and in Io. lib. 4. c. 14. Conc.
Flor. Emis. hom. 3. de. Pasc. Trid. ses. 13 c. 3. and de cons. did. 2. c. qui
man. ducat. and ca. singuli.
particle of a consecrated host, Christ is wholly given and wholly received
in flesh, in soul, in blood, and in Godhead. And where Christ is received
whole and perfect, there can not be wanting the full fruit and effectual
grace of so great a Sacrament And therefore the laity are here defrauded of
no commodity at all, whether thou regardest the thing it self contained in
the Sacrament, to wit, Christ God and man: or do require the Io. 6, 41.51.
1. Cor. 10, 16.
fruit and grace which is given unto those, that receive the Blessed
Sacrament, for the health of their souls: but they receive as much under one
kind, as they should under both, if it were alowable.

Of which matter, certes, there is no more any place left either to Aug. ep.
118. cap. 5.
doubt or to dispute: sithence that the holy Ghost, who according to the
promise of Luc. 22, 31. Io. 14, 16. and 16, 12. Esa. 59, 21.
Christ does teach and govern the Church, has set down unto us a most
certain and plain sentence, and again, and again, confirmed the same, with
the inviolable authority of a most holy Synod. Constable. sess. 13. Bas. sess. 30.
Trid. sess. 21.
Synod. Whereupon it may evidently be concluded, that this custom of reciuing
under one kind is not contrary unto the commandment of God: is ratified by the
lawful authority of the Church: is approved by long continuance of time, and
general consent of the faithful: is commended with most sure reason and
profit: and finally, is to be assuredly accounted for a law, which by none,
but by the Church her self may be changed.

And yet neither the adversaries themselves though here they bark and keep a
stir, are able to show when such custom of communicating began. So that it
is a wonder to see some yet, for all this, who being carried away with a show of
private devotion, do otherwise persuade themselves, and do conspire 1. Tim.
3, 15. Mat. 18, 17.
herein with the new rebels and contemnors of the Church, against the reverend
Aug. lib. 1. con. Cresc. cap. 33.
authority of the whole Church. These men truly ought to fear, least,
whilst they stand so much upon the outward signs of the Sacrament and give
themselves wholly to contentiousnesse: they lose the internal benefit of the
Sacrament, yea and Christ himself altogether: so that it were far better for
them to abstain from any use of the Sacrament at all. For So Much as neither
faith Aug. de unit. Eccles. cap. 4.
nor Sacraments are profitable to any; but to those only, who persist in the
unity of the Church. So that hereupon Saint AUGUSTINE has Lib. 3. cont. lit.
Petil. cap. 40.
said: All the Sacraments of Christ are received not to salvation but to
judgment, without the charity of unity. And again: De bapt. cont. Don. lib. 1.
cap. 8.
what does either sound faith, or happily, the sound Sacrament of faith profit
a man; where by the deadly wound of Schism, the sound health of charity is
destroyed? And truly there is no doubt, but that they do grievously sin
against Christ himself, who presume to abuse this most holy Aug. lib. 21. ciu.
c. 25. Trid. ses. 13. cap. 2. and 8.
badge of unity, to make it as a badge of Schismatic division.

9 What profit comes by the Eucharist being received as it ought to be?

Very much doubtless, and exceeding great. For, this is the holy banquet
wherein Christ is received, the memory of his Passion Basil. ser. 1. de bapt.
c. 3.
is solemnised, the mind is Ambr. in Psa. 118. ser. 15. verse. 4. Conc. Trid.
sess. 13. ca. 2.
replenished with grace, and a pleadge of future glory is given us: As the
Church moved by the feeling and experience of these fruits, does notablely
sing.

This is the Io. 6, 32.35.48.51.58 and ibi Theo. and Cyril.
Bread that descended from heaven, and gives life to the world, and vpholdeth
and strengthens our minds in spiritual life.

This is that holy Synaxis or Communion, 1. Cor. 10, 17. Conc. Flor.
which signifies and causes also the faithful to be linked together amongst
themselves, as members of one and the same body, and to be associated unto the
merits of all Saints and devout persons: moreover (which is a more blessed
and happy thing) it unites the^ Chry. ho. 45. in Io. and 61. ad pop. Hill. lib.

does this Sacrament work in us; For in the least sins it diminishes our
feeling, and in the greater sins it cutteth off consent. If any of you do not
feel neither so often, nor such vehement motions of Anger, Envy, Lechery, or
such other like: let him give thanks to the body and blood of our Lord because
the virtue of the Sacrament works in him: and let him be glad that a most
festered sore does now draw near to perfect soundness. And the same Citatura

again in an other place: This body of Christ, is a medicine unto the sick,
and a way to the waifaring pilgrims: which strengthens the weak, delights
the strong, and cures languishing faintness. By this a man is made more meek
to take correction; more patient to abide labor; more fervent in love; in
taking heed more circumspect; more prompte in obedience, more devout in
thanksgiving.

IONATIVS has written, willing us to co come often and speedely unto the
Eucharist, and (as he calls) it to the glory of God. For when this is
continually done, the powers of Satan are expelled, who bends all his
endeavors, in to fiery darts to sin. This bread is a medicine causing
immortallitie, a preservative, never to die, but to live in God through Jesus
Christ.

10 What things are required for the worthy receiving of the Eucharist, and
reaping the fruits and commodities thereof?

THe answer is easy of the Apostle himself: Let a man prove 1. Cor. 11 28.
and ibid. Theoph. and Ansel. Greg. in 1. Reg l. 2 c. 1. Nyss. de perf. Christ.
forma
himself: and so let him eat of that bread. As also S. AUGUSTINE Ser. 1. de
temp.
has said: In the body of Christ our life does consist: let him therefore
change his life, who means to receive life.

And this proving of a man's self, and change of life, consists speacially in
four things: to wit, there must be faith, penance, attention of mind, and a
decent composition of the Christian man.

Faith requires thus much, that thou do not doubt any whit at all of Bas.

those things that we have said, and other the like appertaining unto this

OF THE SACRAMENT OF PENANCE.

man has truly detested and rightly confessed.

ye the Holy Ghost: whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven them:
and whose you shall retain, they are retained. Then in an other place; Amen I

Lord, Whatsoever you shall bind upon earth, shall be bound also in heaven:
and whatsoever you shall loose upon earth, shall be loosed also in heaven.

By which it plainly apeareth, that the effect of this Sacrament is excellent
and full of comfort, as being the means whereby are remitted all manner of
sins, though never so foul and abominable: and they absolved without any
difference, that have guilty consciences in the sight of Almighty God: and
this by the Ministry of a Priest, through the divine ordinance of Christ. And
therefore the power and authority of Priests, is now far more excellent,
and more to be accounted of, than of Leuit. 4, 22.27. and 5, 4, 15. and 6, 2.
and 13, 2.17, 37. and 14, 2.18. Mat. 8, 4 Luc. 17, 14.

2 Wherefore is this Sacrament of Penance needful?

THat a man having fallen after Baptism and become the enemy of God, obtaining
by means of this Sacrament remission of sins, may be reconciled unto God, and
of a dead man be made alive, and of wicked become just. For which cause, the
Fathers do not unadvisedly call Pacia. ep. 1. ad Sympr. Hier. in ca. 3. Esa.
and ep. 8. ad Demetr. de seruand. Virg. cap. 6. Ambros. ad Virg. laps c. 8.
Trid. ses. 6 c. 14. and ses. 14. can. 2. Tert. de paenit. c. 7. Ezech. 18, 30.
and 33, 11
Penance the second table after shipwreck, to wit, by the which, every man may
be transported out of the whirle-poole of mortal sin as out of a shipwreck,
into the grace and favor of almighty God, though laden and pestered with
many, and those very heinous sins.

3 When is this Sacrament taken as it ought to be, and works effectually?

VVHhen he that sueth for remission of his sins, Conc. Flor. and Trid. ses.
14. cap. 3. and can. 4.
does use these three parts or acts, Contrition, Confession, and
Satisfaction, which do comprehend the full conversion of a man unto God, the
duty of a penitent, and his perfect renewing. Of which Ser. de paenit. 2. Reg.
16, 5. Ps. 50, 19.5. and 6, 7. and 37, 7.18. and 101, 4.10 2. Reg. 12, 13. and
24, 10 3. Reg. 21, 25. Ionae. 3, 7
S. CHRYSOSTOM speaks in this manner. Perfect Penance does constrain the
sinner to suffer all things willingly: Contritrition in his heart, Confession
in his mouth, and in his actions nothing but humility. This to be wholesome
Penance S. CHRYSOSTOM affirms, that by those very means that we offend God,
which certes we do by heart, word and deed, by the same we may be reconciled
unto God, in heart by Contrition, in mouth by Confession, in deed by
Satisfaction.

To Contrition appertains that place: A troubled spirit is a Psalm. 50, 19.
sacrifice to God: a contrite and humble heart, O God thou will not despise.

Confession, S. LVKE does notify in these words: Act. 19, 18. Number. 5, 6.
Many of them that believed, came confessing and declaring their deeds. And
the Iac. 5, 16. and ibid. Be^.
Apostle S. JAMES teaches: Confess your sins one to another.

And to Satisfaction do belong those worthy fruits of Penance, which Mat.
3, 2. Luc. 3, 8. Act. 26, 20.
S. IHON Baptist requires, and amongst them Alms is accounted. Of these,
DANIEL the Prophet says thus: Redeem Dan. 4, 24.
thy sins with Alms, and thy iniquities with mercy toward the poor.

A great offense has need of great Satisfaction, says Amb. ad Virg. lap. c. 8
S. AMBROSE.

And hereu^to also is referred that which S. PAVL says of mourning for those
2. Cor. 12, 21.
Corinthians, because they had not as yet done Penance for the uncleanness
and fornication, and incontinency which they had committed. Trid. ses. 14. cap.
4. Flor. Aug. ser. 3. in Not. Do. etc. 2. de paenit. medicin. seu ho. 50. ex
50. and cap 15. Fulg. li. 1. de remiss. pec. c. 12.


4 What is Contrition?

IT is a grief of mind, and a detestation conceived for sin, because
Almighty God is therewith displeased, joined with a full purpose of amendment
of life.

This Contrition is Chrysostom. in Ps. 50. and de compunct. l. 1. and 2. Aug. de
paenit. medic. c. 9. Amb. c. 8. ad Virg. laps. Trid. ses. 14. can. 5.
procured, if a man do diligently behold the foulness, enormity, and
multitude of his sins; if he carefully think upon that sovereign goodness
offended, of the grace of God, and other gifts lost: if he do deeply
waighe and stand in awe of the inevitable Heb. 9, 27. Sopho^. 1, 15. Mat. 25,
41. Mar. 9, 43.
necessity of the uncertain hour of death, the horrible severity of the
judgment to come, and the everlasting pains prepared for sinners.

Hereu^to appertains that of EZECHIAS: Esa. 38, 15.
I will recou^t unto thee all my years in the bitterness of my soul. And that
of DAVID: Ps. 118, 120.
I stood in awe of thy judgments. And that which he also in lamenting manner
does pray: Ps. 37, 9.
I am afflicted and too much humbled: I did rore with the sighs of my heart, And
a little after, Ibid. v. 19
I will declare my iniquity, and I will think for my sin.

Also it is an express speech of God himself unto a sinner: Thou Apoc. 2, 4.
and 2. ad Cor. 12.21. and 7, 9.
have left thy first Charity, be mindful therefore from whence thou art
fallen: and do Penance. Luc. 12, 5 Mat. 10, 28.
And Christ in the Gospel; Fear him says he, who after he has killed, has
power to cast into hell. Yea I say unto you, fear him. Now finally this
grief of Contrition, does prepare us to remission of sins, in-case it be
joined with Amb. l. 1. de paenit. c. 1.
a confidence of Gods mercy, and a desire of performing those things which do
belong to the Sacrament of Aug. de paenit. med. cap. 11. and in Ench. ca. 65.
Ambr. in Ps. 37. etc. 8. ad Virg. laps.
Penance.

5 Is Confession necessary?

YEA verily: but not only as some do falsely suppose, that interior
Confession which is to be done in the presence of God Chry. ho. 42. in Mat.
every day, according to the example of holy DAVID, who says, I have Ps. 31,
5.
said I will confess against my self my injustice unto our Lord: But also
this exterior confession which is done unto a Orig. in Ps. 37. ho. 1. and ho.
2. in Leu. Chry. l. 3. de sacer. Niss. orat. in eos qui alios acerbius
iudicant. Pet. Clun. l. 1. mirac. c. 3. 4. 5. 6 and l. 2. c. vlt.
Priest of all the sins which do come into a man's mind after diligent
search and examination of his conscience.

So is it written of men of the Primative Church: Many of them that Act. 19, 18.
believed came confessing and declaring their deeds. Which manner of
confessing to be very neecssary, not only the holy laws of the Church, Con.
Lateran. ca^. 21. Flor. and Trid ses 14. cap. 5.
and the reverent writings Clem. ep 1. ad frat. Do. Dion. ep. 8. ad Demoph.
Tert. de paenit. ca. 8. 9. 10. 12. Orig. in Ps. 37. ho. 1. and 2. and ho. 2 in
Leuit. Cyp. de laps. Pacia in paraen. ad paenit. Hier. in c. 10. Eccle. Chry.
ho. 30. in Genesis and 16. in Mat.
of the Fathers do confirm, but also the divine words of Christ do conclude
and declare, when he says, Joan. 20, 23.
Whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven them: And whose you shall
retain, they are retained. But to remitte and retain sins (whereas this is
an office of a Judge) no Priest can have authority, except he first examine and
know very perfectly the sinners cause, whereof he has to judge. Neither
can this knoweledge be had, before that the party which commits himself to
be judged and absolved by the Priest as his Aug. lib. 20. ciu. c. 9. Greg.
ho. 26 in Euang. Chry. l. 3. de sacer. and ho. 5. de verb Esa. Hier. ad Heliod.
ep. 1. cap. 7.
Judge, and Con. Lat. can. 21. Wormat. c. 25. Orig. ho. 1. and 2. in Psalm. 37.
Physician, does so discover and lay open his wounds in such distinct and
several manner by voluntary Confession: that the Priest may plainly perceive
where the sins are to be loosened, and where they are to be bound.

6 What do the Fathers write of Confession?

THey certes, do with one consent not only commend and approve unto us the
benefit of Confession and perpetual practice of it in the Church: but the
bond also and necessity thereof.

And to allege amongst very many a few, and those most approved witnesses;
first Quaest. 288. in reg. breu. vide quaest. 229. and in ep. 3. can. ad
Amphil. can. 73.
S. BASIL the great says thus: It is judged necessary that sins be confessed
unto those to whom is committed the dispensation of the mysteries of God: for
so the very Penitents of ancient times are found to have confessed their
sins unto holy me^.

Then De laps. vide ep. 10. and 55.
S. CYPRIAN. I beseech you my breethren, says he, every one to confess his
sin, whilst yet he that sins remains in this world, whilst his
confession may be admitted, whilst every man's Satisfaction and remission given
by the Priests is acceptable unto our Lord.

Hereunto accords the sentence of S. AUGUSTINE, Hom. 49. ex 50. cap. 3. and
ho. 41. and 50 cap. 4. and 5.
who teaches in this manner: Do ye Penance, such as is done in the Church,
that the church may pray for you. Let no man say within himself I do it in
secret, I do it before God alone: God who pardons me, knows that I do in
heart. Was it there foresaid in vain. Mat. 18, 18. Joan 20, 23.
Whatsoever you shall loose in earth, shall be loosed in Heaven? Were the KEYS
given to the Church of God in vain? Do we frustrate the Gospel of God? Do
we frustrate the words of Christ? Do we promise you that which he denies?
Do we deceive you? And in another place: Lib. 2 de visit. infirm. cap. 4.
There are says he, that do think it sufficient for their salvation, if they
confess their sins to God alone, unto who^ nothing is hidden, and every man's
conscience lies open. For they will not, or they are ashamed, or they disdain
to show themselves unto PRIESTS, who^ yet our Lord has by MOISES ordained to
discern between Leuit. 13, 2. and 14, 12. Luc. 17, 14. Mat. 8, 4.
Leaper, and Leaper. But I will not have thee deceived with this opinion, and
be ashamed thereby to confess them unto the vicegerent of our Lord, either
languishing with shamefastness, or stiff-necked with indignation. For of
reason in like manner must we admit him for our judge, which our Lord does not
disdain to be his Vicar. And it is no less evident that Ep. 91. ad Theod.
vide ep. 80. ad Episc. Camp.
LEO the great has left in writing; The manifold mercies of God does so
succor the falls of men, that not only by the grace of Baptism, but also by
the medicine of Penance, the hope of life everlasting might be repaired: that
they which had violated the benefit of regeneration; condemning themselves in
their own judgment, might come to remission of sin: the succors of Gods
goodness being so ordained, that pardon cannot be had at Gods hands but by the
supplication of Priests. For the Mediator of 1. Tim. 2, 5.
God and Men, Christ Jesus, has given this power to Prelates of the Church
that they might both admit unto Penance those which confess: and receive
them being purged with wholesome satisfaction; to the Communion of the
Sacraments, by the gate of reconciliation.

7 What ought we to think of Satisfaction.

Truly thus much, Greg. in cap. 9. lib. 1. Reg. Bas. q. 12. in reg. breu.
that there is one kind of Satisfaction proper unto Christ our Redeemer; and an
other common to all faithful penitents. That was once accomplished in the Heb.
9, 25. Ephesians. 5, 2.26. and 4, 32. 1. Joan. 2, 2. Joan. 1, 29.
body of Christ crucified, when that immaculate Lamb took away the sins of
the world, that they which by nature were the Sons of Ephesians. 2, 3. 2. Cor. 5,
18. Cypr. ep. 59. and 10. Tert. de paenit. ca. 5. 7. 8. 9. Conc. Trid. sess.
14. cap. 8 and 9. de sacr. Paenit.
wrath, might be reconciled unto God: but this, which belongs unto
penitentes; is done every day in the church by the members of Christ, when
being sorry for our sins, we do after Confession perform those things,
which the PRIEST when he gave absolution enioined: or when of our own accord
we do bring forth the worthy fruits of penance, whereby we may in some part at
the least, recompense the faults and offenses of our life past.

This is a certain Exodus 32, 31. Nu^. 12, 9 and 14, 19.27 and 20, 10.24 Psalm.

Satisfaction both of reuengement and of purgation: and it is so far from
obscuring the benefit and Satisfaction of Christ our Redeemer; that it does
more commend and set forth the same. For that Satisfaction of his going before,
and especially cooperating Chry. ho. 80. ad pop.
with us, we do according unto the Scripture, use Esa. 56, 1. Ezech. 18, 21.27.
Hier. 22, 3. 2. Cor. 7, 9. Ps. 50, 1.6. and Chrysostom. ibid. and in Mat. 3.
judgment and Justice; taking reuengment upon our selves for our sins; and
cleansing the relickes of sin that remain in us; procuring and deserving for
our selves the more plentiful grace of God: finally, professing by these
means, that we do willingly embrace the Cross of Christ, deny Luc. 9, 23.
Mat. 16, 24. To. 6, 2.6. Ephesians. 4, 22. Col. 3, 9.
our selves, mortify our flesh, and being stricken with an hatred of old ADAM

strive against the motions of a depraved mind. After this sort did holy 2.

DAVID, the Ninevites and others give themselves to Satisfaction, whom it is
manifest to have done Penance in Sackecloth, Ashes, Sighing, Mourning, Fasting,
and other afflictions, and they are read to have bin grateful and approved unto
God therefore. And this part of Penance the Scripture confirming, and
commending unto us cries out: Joel. 2, 12
Turn ye to me with all your heart, in Fasting, in Weepeing, and Lamentation.
And in another place: Ezech. 18, 30.31.
Convert and do Penance for all your iniquities: And iniquity shall not be
unto you in destruction. And S. PAVL teaches also, that the sadness which is
according to God, does work Penance. 2. Cor. 7, 9.
And he gives general admonition: that, If 1. Cor. 11, 31.
we did Judge our selves: we should not be Judged of our Lord.

And for that cause we shall not need to discourse of the name of
Satisfaction, which certes in the Fathers is very familiar: seeing that the
thing it self is expressly set down in holy Scripture.

8 Let us see some sentences of the Fathers touching Satisfaction?

SAint CYPRIAN that most holy Martyr, teaches in this manner: Look how much
De lapsis. Idem ep. 55. ad Corn. and ep. 10. ad Clerum.
Almighty God is prone to pardon by the piety of a Father, so much is he to
be feared by the Majesty of a Judge. Let a deep wound have diligent and long
physic. Let not the Penance be less than the fault: we must pray more
earnestly, passe-ouer the day in lamenting; the nights in watching and
weeping; spend the whole time in mourneful tears; lie upon the ground in
ashes; and wallowe in sackeclothe and filthe. And again the same: God is to
be De lapsis. vide eu^d. de elecmos.
beseeched and to be pacified with our satisfaction: our sins must be
pondered: our actions and secreat intentions surueied: and the deserts of our
conscience waighed. And a little after: The way of Penance which the Priest
shows us, let us embrace: let us use the vital remedies which he takes out
of heavenly Scriptures: and laying open the burden of our conscience before
him, let us demand the wholesome medicine for those secreat wounds which we
have confessed. And let us not cease to do Penance, and call upon the mercy
of our Lord; least that which seems but little in the quality of the sin,
be augmented by the negligence of Satisfaction.

And Ho. 50. ex 50. cap. 5. vide in Ench. cap. 70. 71. and 65.
Saint AUGUSTINE has said very plainly: That it is not sufficient for a man
to amend his manners and to leave his misdeeds; unless by the sorrow of
Penance, by the sighings of humility, and by the Sacrifice of a contrite heart
together with the cooperation of alms, Satisfaction be made to God for those
things also that have been committed.

Then in S. HIEROME we find it thus written: In Epita. Paul. cap. 7. and Chry.
ho. 10. in Mat.
The body is to be afflicted which has spente much time indelicacy: long
laughter must be recompensed with continual weeping: the soft linen and
precious silks, must be changed into the sharpness of haire-clothe.

To this end also is this speech of Lib. 2. de paenit. c. 5. et li. 1. cap. 16.
S. AMBROSE: He that does Penance, ought not only to wash away his sin with
tears; but also to cover his faults with more reformed actions, that sin
may not be imputed unto him. And again in another place: For a great Ad Virg.
laps. ca. 8. and lib. 1. de paenit. cap. 2.
wound, a deep and long medicine is necessary. Great wickedness, must of
necessity have great Satisfaction. Finally so says S. GREGORY. It is to be
Hom. 34. in Euan. vide Emis. ad mon. ho. 5. and 10. Theod. in epit. diuinor
decret. ca. de paenit. and l. 4 haeret. fab. de Audianis
seriously thought and considered, that he which knows himself to have
committed things unlawful, must endeavor to abstain from some things that
are lawefull; that thereby he may make Satisfaction unto his Creator.

9 Is there any place for Satisfaction after Death?

FOr the explication of this point, we must consider the diverse estates of
them that die. For some of them do keep the grace of God, and innocence of
life, even to their end. Unto whom appertains that saying of In orat.
Manassis.
MANASSES; That, Unto just persons, and those which have not sinned, as
ABRAHAM, ISAAC, and JACOB; Penance was not ordained. Others have sinned indeed,
and fallen from the grace of God which once they received, but they have purged
in this life the filthe of their sins, with the worthy works of Penance: as
2. Reg. 12, 13. Psalm. 6, 7.
DAVID, Esa. 38, 15
EZECHIAS, Mat. 26, 57.
S. PETER, and Luc. 7, 37
S. MARY MAGDALEN. Both these kinds have no need of Satisfaction after
death, but are altogether free from all bond thereof.

But far more in number are those of a middle sort, and yet not very evil, as
Ench. ca. 11^. Beda. in cap. 11. Pro.
S. AUGUSTINE shows; who have not performed perfect Penance for their sins

Augustine expound this place, in Psalm. 37. and l. 21. de ciuit. c. 26. de fide.
and oper. cap. 16. and in Psalm. 80. So does also Origin ho. 12. and 13. in

Therefore that we may answer to the question proposed: such kind of persons

death. Which yet nevertheless Aug. vt supra. and li 21. ciu. c. 24. ho. 16. ex

God of his great mercy is wont to release by the devout intercession of
those that are alive, that so they which are depated, being helped in the
Church by the Suffrages of their brethren, and members; may be lightened of
their sins and of the terrible pains due unto the same. And hereunto

who^ to alleadg one in steed of many, and him a witness most worthy of
credit: Li. de cura mor. ca. 1.
S. AUGUSTINE writes thus: In the books of the Machabees, we read Sacrifice
to have been offered for the dead. But although it were no where extant in the
old Scriptures: yet is the authority of the Universal Church not small, whose
practice in this behalf is most evident; where, in the prayers of the Priests,
which are made unto our Lord at his Altar, the commendation also of those that
are departed has a peculiar place. And again: It is to be thought (says he)
that there shall be no Purgatory Lib. 21. ciu. ca. 16. vide Mat. 12, 32.
Which place is expounded of remission of sins in the other world by prayers
of the Church. By S. Aug. l. 21. ciu. c. 24. and l. 6. in Iul. c. 5. Greg. l. 4

pains, after that last and terrible judgment. And what can be more
plainelye spoken than those words? It is not to be doubted but that by the
prayers of the Aug. de verb. Apo. ser. 32. cap. 1. and 2. vide Isid. lib. 1. de
offic. cap. 18. Raban. lib. 2. de instit. Cler. cap. 44.
holy Church, and by the most wholesome Sacrifice, and by Alms which are
bestowed for their souls; those which are departed be helped, that our Lord
may deal more mercifully with them, than their sins have deserved. For this
has been delivered by the Fathers, and the universal Church observes; that
for those which are departed in the Communion of the Body and Blood of Christ;
when their memory is made at the Sacrifice in the due place: Prayers also are
powered out unto God, and it is expressly mentioned that the Sacrifice is
offered for them. And when for the helping of them, works of mercy are
exercised: who may doubt but that they are available unto them, for whom
prayers are not in vain offered? It is not at al to be doubted but these
things do profit the dead, yet such only who lived so before death, that
these things might be profitable to them after death. Thus writes Saint
AUGUSTINE above 1200. years agone: to omit many also more ancient than
himself, Ep. 52. and 66.
S. CYPRIAN, Vt supra.
ORIGIN, De Eccle. Hier. cap. 7.
S. DENIS, Ep. 1. and lib. 6. constable. cap. 29.

Ho. 3. in Phil and 41. in^t. Cor. and 69 ad pop. Damasc. in orat. de def.
Athan. and Nyss. apud Damasc.
S. CHRYSOSTOM does in plain terms exhort, both that we our selves to our
power do help them that are departed, and put others in mind also to pray
and give Alms for them. For it was not unadvisedly decreed by the Apostles,
that in the dreadful Mysteries, Commemoration should be made of those that are
departed. For they knew well that they should gain much, and reap no small
commodity thereby, Thus writes S. CHRYSOSTOM.

Finally this is that which to this day the holy Church, a faithful
interpretour of the Scriptures, has taught against the Epiph. haer. 75. Aug.

Aerians, that there is a certain Purgatory, or eme^datory Trid. ses. 25. and

Paenit. and li. 4. Dial. ca. 39. Bern. sermon. 66. in Cant.
S. AUGUSTINE calls it, in which, the faithful souls departed in Christ,
must suffer and satisfy for the punishment of those sins, for which wholely
Satisfaction was not made in this life by Penance: except as Ench. ca. 110. and
de cura mort. c. 1. 4. 18.
Saint AUGUSTINE speaks, they be relieved by the devotion of their friends
that are alive.

10 What is the commendation and dignity of Penance?

PEnance is the beginning of the preaching of the Gospel: Mat. 3, 2. and 4.17.
Mat. 1, 4. Luc. 15, 7.10. Mat. 7, 13. and 11, 12.
the joy of Angels in heaven: the strait way upon earth: and that narrow gate,
by which the faithful do travel toward life, and lay violent hands upon the
kingdom of heaven. She Lib. de vera and falls. paenit. c. 1. Bas. in homil. de
ver. paenit. Chry. in ho. and sermon. de paenit.
erecteth them that be fallen: cures the wounded: strengthens the weak:
quickneth the dead: restores those that are lost: and finally, all things
that sin does impair, Penance does renew and refreshe in us. By her we give
a testimony of an hatred of our life past: of the contempt of our selves: and
of al submissio^. She being our guide: we mourning; find Mat. 5, 5.
comfort: being wounded; we are cured: being humble; we are exalted. This is
she whereby we overcome the devils, and the pestilence of vice: we drive away
deserved Hier. 18, 8 Ezech. 18, 21. and 33, 11 Ionae. 3, Mat. 3, 8. 2. Cor. 7,
10. Act. 11, 18.
punishments: we pacify Gods wrath: we purchase grace: and get glory
everlasting. Hereupon are those speeches of Christ in the Gospel: Mat. 4, 17.
Do Penance for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. Luc 5, 32
I came not to call the Just, but sinners to Penance. Unless Luc. 13, 6
you have Penance, you shall all likewise perish. But he finally does true
Penance, to conclude all these things with the words of S. CYPRIAN; Ep. 14.
Who obaying the precepts of God and the Priests: with his obedience and works
of Justice does win our Lord.

OF THE SACRAMENT OF EXTREME UNCTION.

Catholic Church does constantlye teach: to wit; that this is a sacred
sign, ordained in consecrated oil, that thereby heavenly virtue may by Gods
ordinance be applied unto sick persons, for the health not only of their
souls, but of their bodies also.

Unto which Sacrament Saint JAMES the Apostle, gives most clear and evident
testimony, for as much as he has written these very words: Iac. 5, 14. and
Ibid. Beda.
Is any man sick among you? Let him bring in the Priests of the church and
let the^ pray over him, anoiling him with oil in the name of our Lord. And the
prayer of faith shall save the sick: And our Lord shall lift him up: And if he
be in sins they shall be remitted him.

2 What does the Apostle teach by these words?

HE shows first of all that the Elemente, or matter of this Sacrament, is
oil consecrated (as notes well In cap. ^. Mar. and in ^. Luc and in ^. Iac.
Innoc. 1. vt supra. Conc. Meld. vt supra.
S. BID, by the benediction of a Bishop. And it signifies Theoph. in ca. 6.
Mar.
cherefulnesse of mind, and an internal strengthening which through the grace
of God, the sick man feels by the virtue of this Sacrament.

Then does the same Apostle set down the proper minister of this Sacrament:
to wit, a Chry. li. 3. de sacerd. and Orig. ho. 2. en Leuit.
Priest, who with prayer is decently to exercise this holy unction. Neither was
it without some signification of the minister of this Sacrament written of the
Apostles; that, Mar. 6, 13 and 61. Theoph. and Beda.
They anointed with oil many sick, and healed the^.

Furthermore, the parties that receive this Sacrament; are by Saint JAMES
called sick persons: Pet. Clu^ lib. 1. mirac. cap 20. and li. 2. cap. 32.
because, as the manner, and custom of the Church is; this holy unction is
only celebrated in grievous and dangerous sickenesses.

3 What is the profit and effect of this Sacrament?

FIrst it avails to remission of Bern. in vita Mal. Conc. Trid. vt supra.
Pet. Clun. li. ^. ep. 1.
such sins as the sick person has not already purged by the remedies of
Penance: that he may before all things be eased of the burden, and cured of
the malady of his sins.

Then profits it also, either to drive away, or to Ibidem Bern.
assuage the infirmity of the body; so far forth as it is expedient for the
sick person to be delivered of the same.

Last of all, it is of force to minister comfort, and confidence: of which
certes there is special need, in that last agony and departure; at what time
the Cyril. Al. in orat. de ^xitu animae. Greg. lib. 2. mor cap. 17. and 18. ho.
39. in Euang. Clim. grad 6. Eus. Emis. ho. 1. ad monac. Sever. Sulp de ua^s. S.
Mart.
dying man must have very sore conflictes, both with most bitter pains, and
also with most horrible feendes. Wherefore although bodily health be not
always hereby restored unto the sick person, who often chances to die after
this unction received: yet a peculiar grace is given in this Sacrament, to
bear the force and troublesomnesse of the disease more constantly; and to take
death it self more easily. And this is it, that by his Apostles God has
promised: Iac. 5, 15.
The prayer of faith shall save the sick: And our Lord shall lift him up: And
if he be in sins, they shall be remitted him.

To the signifieng certes of which effects, even the nature, and native force
of oil does fitly agree, as In cap. 6. Mar.
THEOPHILACTE shows. Wherefore it behooves us exactly to observe that which
Ser. 215. de temp. vide etiam de rect Cath. c^nuers. and de visit insir lib. 2.
c. 4. ite^ in speculo.
S. AUGUSTINE does most holesomelie admonish: So often as any infirmitye
chances, let him that is sick receive the Body and Blood of Christ, and
after that let him anoint his body: that, that which is written may be
accomplished in him: Is Iac. 5, 14.
any man sick? Let him bring in the Priests and let them pray over him,
annoiling him with oil in the name of our Lord. And the prayer of faith shall
save the sick. And our Lord shall lift him up: And if he be in sins they
shall be remitted him.

OF THE SACRAMENT OF ORDERS.
1 What is the Sacrament of holy Orders?

Aug. lib. 2. cont. ep. Parmen. c. 13. et de bono co^iug. c. 24 and li. 1.
co^t. Do^. cap. 1. Leo. ep. 81. ad Diosc. Greg. in cap 10. and 16 lib. 1. reg.

Cor. Theoph. in cap. 19. Luc. Pet Clun. lib. 6. ep. 1.
IT is that whereby a singular grace and spiritual power is given to some, that
they may by open profession bear office in the Church.

This is the Sacrament, by which as by a door do necessarily enter the lawful
dispensers of the 1. Cor. 4, 1. Mal. 2, 7. 1. Tim. 3, 1. and 5, 17. Ephesians. 4,
11. 1. Cor. 14, 2.19. and 12, 28
mysteries, and of the word of God; the Ministers of Christ and his Church; as
Bishops; Priests; Deacons; Finally, all those whosoever they be that do
exercise functions in the Church orderly, and with authority.

For no man, as the Heb. 5, 4. Act. 1, 24. Cypr. ep. 52. Tert de praescript.
ca. 41. Conc. l. at. c. 3. Innoc. 3. ad Metens. cap. cum ex iniuncto. Tit. de
haer.
Scripture testifies, Takes, or ought to take, the honor to himself, to
wit of exercising the functions of the Church; But he that is called of God
as AARON: that is, unless he be consecrated by the Sacrament of visible
ordinatio^; and be by a Mat. 10, 1 Luc. 9, 1. Mar. 16, 15. Io 20, 21. and 17,
18. Act. 13, 2. Tit. 1, 5.
Bishop lawefully ordered, and sent to the work of some certain Ministry,
which in his degree he may exercise in the Church according to the Laws of
Divine and Apostolical Tradition.

2 Are not all Christians Priests a-like?

THey may surely be Apo. 1, 6. and 5, 10. 1. Pet. 2, 9.
so called in this sense, that, as Priests were wont to exercise certain
external Sacrifices and sacred functions: so, as many are regenerated in
Christ, may and ought daily to offer, and diligently to exercise, certain
spiritual 1. Pet. 2, 5 Romans 12, 1. Psalm 49, 23. and 50, 19. Phil. 4, 18. Heb.
13, 15.16. vide ^as. ser. 2. de Fap. cap 8. Aug. 20. ciu. c. 10. Leo. ser. 3.
in anniuers Amb. lib. 4. Sacr. cap. 1.
sacrifices: to wit, Prayer, Praises, Thankes-giuings, mortifying of the
Flesh, and others of like sort. So that for this cause they are said in holy
Scripture to be spiritual Priests before God, and to offer up spiritual
Sacrifices.

But if we take this name of Priesthood properly: all indifferently are not
Priests; but those only unto whom the authority of the Church has committed,
to be proper ministers Ignat. ad Her. Chry. ^i. 3. and 6. de sacerd. and ho.

of Sacraments, and has granted power and right to consecrate, offer, and
distribute the holy Euchariste, and both to remitte and to retain the sins
of men. And of these priests and prelates of the new Law, thus writes S.
PAVL: The Priests that rule 1. Tim. 5, 17.
well, let them be esteemed worthy of double honor, especially they that
labor in the word and Doctrine. And this doubtless cannot appartaine to
women; whom 1. Tim. 2, 11.

1. Cor. 14, 34 Tert. de praescrip. cap. 41. Epiph. haer. 42 and 40.


the same Apostle forbids to teach in the Church, and bids to be silent:
neither can it concern the Leo. ep. c 2. ad Maxi.
Laity at all; whose part it is after the manner of sheep, to be fed, Io.
10, 11 and 21, 15. 1. Pet. 5, 2. and 2, 13. Heb. 13, 17. Romans 13, 1. Mat. 23,
2. Luc. 10, 16. 1. Io. 4, 6.
and not to feed, to be governed, not to govern: not to prefer, but to
submit and humble themselves unto their Prelates, and to hear, observe, and
do, whatsoever they sitting in the chair shall say; whether they be good, or
evil: according as we read it commanded by the word of God.

Wherefore as in the Church Triumphant, there are Angels different Ephesians. 1, 2^
Col. 1, 16. Dan. 7, 10. Dion. de caelest. hier. ca. 10.
in order and power, who with decent disposition, do faithfully execute and
fulfill the offices imposed upon them. So also the Church 1. Tim. 3, 15.

Cant. 6, 9. Anacl. ep. 1. 2. and 3.

Isid. lib. 2. de offic. ca. 5. and sequ.


Militant which is the house of God, and as it were a certain camp set in
battle a-ray, has her peculiar Ministers distinct from other Christians, and
disposed in Godly order amongst themselves, for the prosecuting of the public
and common sunctions of the Church upon earth; to wit, that for the benefit
of the Christian people, they may even by public profession, and with due
Comeliness and Majesty, bestow their labors in those Heb. 5, 1. and 8, 3.
and 13, 17. 2. Cor. 5, 20.
things which belong unto God, and the health of souls.

3 In what place does the Scripture give testimony unto this Sacrament?

Tit. 1, 5.
THere truly, where it teaches of the Apostles, that in choosing, appointing,
and ordering, of the Ministers of the Church, they used imposition of Act. 6,
6. and 13, 3. and 14, 22. 1. Tim. 4, 14 and 5, 22. 2. Tim. 1, 6.
hands. For by this as by a certain and effectual toke^ of present grace, which
is exhibited and Amb. li. de dignit. Sacerd. c. 5. Niceph. lib. 12. cap. 14.
received in the giving of holy orders: is this Sacrament which we speak of
commended unto us.

And therefore S. PAVL writing to TIMOTHY whom he had created Bishop, and
admonishing him of the grace that he had received in this Sacrament; does
speak in this manner. 1. Tim. 4, 14. and ibid. Theoph. and Haymo.
Neglect not the grace that is in thee, which is given thee by Prophecy, with
impositio^ of the hands of Priesthood: And again writing to the same
Bishop. 2. Tim. 1, 6. and ibid. Theoph.
I admonish thee, that thou resuscitate the grace of God, which is in thee, by
the imposition of my hands.

And because it is very much material, Leo. ep. 87. ad Episc. Maur. synod Ro^.
sub Sylu c. 11. Trid. ses. 23. c. 7. and 12. reforma.
what kind of men be placed in every of the Churches sunctions, and do receive
Ecclesiastical power by means of this Sacrament: therefore it is said to
every Bishop: 1. Tim. 5, 22.
Impose hands on no man lightly, neither do thou communicate with other
men's sins.

4 How many degrees does this Sacrament contain in it?

IT contains in general, lesser, and greater orders: the lesser are four
Conc. Carth. 4. ca^. 6. and sequ. Laod. can. 24. Trid. ses. 23. Ignat. ad
Antioch. Dion. eccles. hierarch. c. 3. Eusebius. hist. l. 6. cap. 35. ex epist.
Corn.
in number: to wit, of Ostiaries, Lectors, Exorcistes, and Acolites. And the
greater are three: to wit, of Subdeacons, Deacons, and Priests. And of
Priests some are greater, some lesser, known to be ordained Luc. 9, 1. and
10, 1. and ibid. Beda. Clem. ep. 1. Anacl. ep. 2 and 3.
by Christ.

For the greater sort of Priests, are the Apostles and Bishops their Hier. ad
Marcel. ep. 54. Cypr. ep. 69. and 65. Ignat. ad Phila. Aug. in Psalm. 44.
successors, excelling doubtless with a great power and reverend prerogative of
dignity. For it is their office (as the Act. 20, 28. 1. Pet. 5, 1. Heb. 13,
17. Tit. 1, 5. Act. 14, 22.
Scripture testifies) to take heed to themselves and to the wholle flock,
which they do receive of the Holy Ghost, to be cured, and fed: to rule the
Church: to reform the things that are wanting: and to ordain Priests by
Cities.

And the lesser sort of Priests do attend in the Ministerye of the Church
under Bishops, as those Luc. 10, ^ Leo. ep. 88. ad Epi. Gall. Innoc. 3, l. 1.
de mist. Alt. cap. 6.
72. Disciples did under the Apostles: do Heb. 5, 1. and 8, 3.
offer gifts and Sacrifices for sins: and are next unto the same Bishops, as
it were workmen Mat. 9, 37. Luc. 10, 2.
in our Lords harvest.

But the Clerks of the four lesser orders, have this proper office, to Carth.
4. ca^. 6. and seq. Isid. lib. 2. de offic. c. 11. and seq. and lib. 7. ^tym c.
12. Raban lib. 1. de inst. cler. c. 9. and sequ. Con. Aquis. 1. sub Ludouico
Pio. ca. 2 and sequ. R^m. sub Sylu. c. 3. 6. 9.
attend upon Priests and Bishops in many businesses and affairs: to dispose
the people that do resort to holy things: and that they themselves by little
and little, as it were by certain degrees, may be well informed and prepared to
undertake greater offices in the Church.

But the other three Carth. 4. ca^. 3. and sequ Isid. sup. c 7. Rabanus. c. 6.
vbi sup. Aquisgr. ca. 6. Arator. l. 1 in Acta. cap. 1^.
greater orders, do afforde greater power both in other things, and in the
holy mysteries of the Euchatiste. Therefore the Subdeacon and Deacon may be
present at the said mysteries as Ministers, and be next unto the Priests
themselves. And although as touching the Sacrament of Orders, and the authority
of offering Sacrifice, there be no difference between Bishops and Priests
Damasus. ep. 4. Isid. lib. 2. de offic. cap. 7. Hieron co^t. Lucif. cap. 4.
Leo. ep. 88. Conc. Hisp. 2. cap 7. Epiph. haeres. 75. Acrianorum.
yet are they more excellent and high tha^ Priests; if we consider the power
and authority of governing the Church, of feeding souls, of confirming the
Baptized, and of ordering Clearkes.

But it is not our intent at this present, exactely to declare what functions
and Laws are prescribed to every particular order. Most certain it is that al
orders, are to be had in great estimation, and diligently to be kept and
maintained. For most firm testimony is given unto the same by the holy
Discipline of the Apostles Tradition, and Amb. in cap 4. ep. ad Ephesians.
the Churches observance, which has continued even unto this day.

5 In what sort do the ancient Fathers write of this Sacrament?

OF this does Saint AUGUSTINE, a Doctor without doubt very Catholic,
manifestly declare, both his own and the Churches mind in these words. Li.
quaest. Vet. and Nou. Test. quaest. 93. vide lib. 2. cont. ep. Parm. c. 13.
In that, that our Lord is read to have breathed upon his Disciples a few
days after his Resurrection; and to have said, receive Io. 20, 21
ye the Holy Ghost: Ecclesiastical power is understood to have been given.
For, because all things in the Tradition of our Lord, are done by the
Holy Ghost. Therefore when a certain rule and form of this Discipline is
delivered unto them, it is said to them: receive ye the holie-Ghost. And
because it appertains truly to Ecclesiastical jurisdiction: he presently
adds, saying: whose sins you retain shall be retained, and whose you
remitte, shall be remitted. Therefore this inspiration, or breathing, is a
certain grace which is infused by Tradition to those that receive Orders,
whereby they may be accounted more commendadable. Whereupon the Apostle says
to TIMOTHY: 1. Tim. 4, 14.
Neglect not the grace which is in thee, which was given thee by the imposition
of hands of a Priest. Therefore once it ought to be done, that for ever after
this Tradition might be thought not to be void of the gift of the Holy Ghost:
Hitherto S. AUGUSTINE.

There are extante also the Cannons of the Apostles, in which it is thus Can.
1. and 2.
decreed: Let a Bishop be created by two or three Bishops: A Priest by one
Bish^p: So a Deacon and others of the Clergy: Then a little after: Can. 68.
vide canone^ insignes. did 59. and seq.
If any Bishop, or Priest, or Deacon, or Subdeacon, or Lector, or Chaunter, do
not fast the holy Lent, or the Wensdaie, or the Parasceue, ( which we now
call Friday:) let him be put out of Orders. unless happily some infirmity of
body do hinder him.

And CAIUS In ep. ad Foelicem. vide Damasum in Pontificali de eod. Caio.
a famous Pope and Martyr, above 1300. years since, reckons up these
Degrees, and Orders, one after an other, when he says: If any man shall
deserve to be a Bishop: first let him be an Ostiary, then a Lector, afterward
an Exorcist, then let him be consecrate an Acolite: after which, a Subdeacon,
Deacon, and afterward Priest: finally, if he be worthy let him be made
Bishop.

Therefore Epist. 52. Zozym. ep. 8 ad Hesich.
Saint CYPRIAN does praise CORNELIUS the Bishop, and writes that he was
commended, and honorablely spoken of by all good persons, as-wel of the
Clergy, as of the people: Because he came not suddenly to the Bishopric, but
having gone through all Ecclesiastical offices, and often purchased favor at
our Lords hand, by Divine services and administrations: he ascended to the
high dignity of Priesthood, by all the steps of Religion: Then afterward he
never required the Bishopric it self, nor desired it, nor violently usurped
it; but being Quiet, Modest, Chaste, Humble, Shamefaste, and finally even
constrained, did undertake the same.

Those orders therefore which the ancient and Apostolical Church has
approved, as appears by the writings of De Eccle. hier. ca. 5. and ad
Demophilum.
Saint DENIS, Ep. 2.
ANACLETE, and Ad Antiochenses.
Saint IGNATIUS; and which also every age since has embraced: those certes,
the Church at this day cannot but conserve and defend.

6 What order in the Church is of greatest account?

THe order of Priests, or Priesthood: of the wonderful and euer-most
reverend dignity, whereof S. CHRYSOSTOM, and Saint AMBROSE have set forth
whole books. Of which also great IGNATIUS says: Epist. ad Smyrn. vide Chrysostom.
l. 3. de Sacer. and ho. 4. and 5. de verb. Esa. vidi Dominu^.
Priesthood is the sum of all honors, which are amongst men: which if any
man shall dishonor, he dishonoreth God, and our Lord Jesus Christ, the first
begotten of all creatures, and the only chief Priest of God by nature. Thus
says he; yea it is evidently warranted by a divine Oracle: That, the Mal. 2,
7. Agg. 2, 12. Gregor. in past. par. 2. cap. 4.
lips of the Priest do keep knowledge, and they shall require the law at
his mouth: because he is the Angel of our Lord of hosts; And again: He that
Deuteronomy. 17, 12.

Cyp ep. 55. and 65.

Greg. lib. 12. ep. 31. ad Foelicem.


shall be proud, not willing to obey the authority of the Priest, who at that
time does minister to thy Lord God: let that man die by the decree of the
Judge, and thou shall take away euel out of Israel, and all the people hearing
will be affraide, that none from henceforwarde may swell with pride. Hereupon
also, the Apostle wills: 1. Tim. 5, 19. vide 2. epist. Fab.
Against a Priest receive not accusation, but under two or three witnesses. And
this truly is written to TYMOTHY, the Bishop of the Ephesians: as that also
which we cited before: The 1. Tim. 5, 17.
Priests that rule well, let the^ be esteemed worthy of double honor:
especially they that labor in the Word and Doctrine.

7 And what conceit ought we to have of evil Priests?

THis is the ordinance of God, which cannot be abolished, that not only good,
but also evil Priests be Eccli. 7, 31. Mat. 10, 40. Luc. 10, 16. Joan 13, 20.

honored in the Church. For he will be acknowledged, received, heard, and
observed, in his Ministers: whereas he has said: Mat. 23, 2.

Aug. ser. 49. de verb. Do. cap. 5. and sequ.

Chrysostom. hom. 85. in Joan.


Upon the Chair of MOSES have sitten the Scribes and Pharisees. All things
therefore whatsoever they shall say to you, observe ye, and do ye: but
according to their works do you not, for they say and do not. But amongst
those that be evil, there is a choice to be made, that we may understand:
that for as much as concerns the office and authority of teaching: we do owe
faith and obedience unto those only who being lawfully ordained and sent by
Bishops, do profess the sound Doctrine of the Church. But of others we must
carefully beware as of enemies and pestiferous persons.

Touching which matter the most ancient IRENEVS, most wisely admonishes and
teaches in this manner: We are Lib. 4. ca. 43. vide (...) them. lib. 3. cap.
2. and. 3.
bound to hear those that are Priests in the Church, which both have
succession from the Apostles and have received the grace and spirit of truth
with this succession of Bishop-like authority: but as for others, which depart
from this principal succession; in what place soever they be gathered
together, we must have the^ in suspicion either as Heretics and men of evil
Doctrine, or as sowers of Schism, and proud persons. And a little Lib. 4.
cap. 44.
after, We must (says he) eschew all such: And cleave unto those who do
keep (as we have said before) the Apostolical Doctrine, and do together with
the order of Priesthood, exhibit sound speech and conversation without
offense, to the confirmation and correction of others. Thus writes that
IRENEVS, whose master was POLICARPE the disciple of S. JOHN the Euangeliste.
And not unlike to this teaches TERTVLLIAN, Lib. de praescr. c. 41.
who does exprobrate the Heretics in this manner, saying: their ordinations
are rash, light, and unconstant: sometimes they place Neophites, sometimes
those that are tied to the world, sometimes eue^ our Apostataes, that they may
bind them with glory, whereas they cannot with truth. There is never more
easy preferment, than in the Camps of Rebels: where the very being, is
deserueing. Therefore one is a Bishop to day, and another to morrow: to day
he his Deacon, who to morrow is a Lector: to to day he is a Priest, who to
morrow is a Layman: for even unto Laymen do they Vide Epiphan. haeres. 24.
and 49.
enioine Priestly offices. Thus far TERTVLLIAN, very lively painting out unto
us, the perverse customs, not of his own time only, but of this our age also;
and sheweing the preposterous endeavors of Sectaries, in the disturbing of
holy things and ordering of Ministers.

8 What is the virtue and effect of this Sacrament?

THe virtue certes is singular, and the effects are manifold. For they which
rightly receive these seven orders which we speak of, do also receive a
spiritual grace Con. Flor and Trid. and Aug. lib. 2. ep. Parm. ca. 13. and in
cap. 10. l. 1. reg.
and power, that they may holsomelie execute, all such things as do
appertain to the proper functions of their orders, and are appointed fit
Ministers, between God and his people. Whereupon S. AMBROSE says, In ca. 12.
1. ad Cor.
A man that is placed in the order, of an Ecclesiastical office, has grace,
whatsoever he be; not truly of him self, but of his order, by the operation of
the holy Ghost.

Furthermore the said parties that receive orders Act. 6, 5.8.10. and 13, 2.
and 14, 20. and 15, 2.42. 1. Tim. 4, 14. Tit. 1, 5. Cypr. ep. 76.
have thereby a certain, and evident testimony, whereby they may commend and
approve both themselves, and their Ministeries also unto others.

And so it comes to pass that they being as it were, marked with those
orders, and being separated unto the ministry of the Church; are well known
and esteemed according to their degree, and very worthily honored. But woe be
to them; Number. 16, 31. Heb. 5.4. 1. Par. 13, 10. 2. Reg. 6, 6. 2. Par. 26, 16.
whom, not the example of AaRON, that was called by God does induce; but
seditiouse humors and swelling of the mind, like unto OZIAS the king, does
carry head long to the occupying and usurping by whatsoever means the offices of
Priestly dignity, upon whom this speech of God does fitly fall: Hier. 23,
21. and 14, 14 and 27, 15. and 29, 9.
I did not send Prophets, and they did run: I did not speak to them, and
they did Prophecy. And these, the Scripture warns us not to accounte as
Ministers of the Church, but to eschew as Io. 10, 1. Cant. 2, 15. Act. 20, 29.
Mat. 7, 15.
Thieves, Robbers, Foxes, Dogs, and Wolves: because they do not enter in by
the door, but either of their own rashness, or for the favor only of some
civil magistrate, Trid. sess. 23. cap. 4.
or the popular multitude, Laod. can. 13.
they assume unto themselves Ecclesiastical offices, seazing upon those holy
functions, without any lawful calling and ordering: To. 10, 15.
But h^w shall they preach unless they be sent? as S. PAVL being one himself
that was Act. 13, 2.
separated unto the work, does say.

Doubtless, order being once broken, Vide Leonem. ep. 87 ad Epis Afr. and
Greg. li. 4. ep. 52. Dion cap. 5. eccles. hier.
and Priesthood taken away: the Hierarchy and princely disposition of the
Church, consisting as well of Priests, and other ministers, as also of
Bishops rightly ordered, would come to decay: Neither should the Church be
that, which it is called, a Camp set in battle array: Cant. 6, 9.
nor the true and lawefull Ministers of the Church, should be discerned: the
office and authority of teaching would become contemptible: the dispensation
of the Sacraments would be unfaithfully and preposterously performed, yea and
altogether frustrate: finally the functions of the Church would be perturbed:
and (as the proof it self too much does show) new and false Doctrines would
increase and swarm by the means of these new and false Ministers of Christ
his spouse: whereby the Church would often be shaken with sore and deadly
co^motions, as we do in our days feel by experience. And for that cause the
Apostle 1. Cor. 12, 28.
Saint PAVL has not only set down diverse degrees of Ministers in the Church:
but has also showed how wholesome and necessary they be: in so much that he
affirms that they were given by Ephesians. 4, 11.
God unto the church, (as it has bin said before.) To the consummatio^ of
Saints, unto the work of the Ministry, unto the edifiing of the body of
Christ: that now we be not children wavering, and carried about with every
wind of Dostrine, in the wickedness of men, in craftiness to the
circumuention of error.

And certes, this is a most evident and sure note of the Church: in that we see
that perpetual, and never as yet, at any time interrupted sucession of
Bishops, and of lawefull orders in the same, which God has placed there-in for
the perfect government, of this his kingdom. And therefore this institution of
Ministers as a most firm Iren. lib. 3 cap. 3. and lib. 4. cap. 43. Optat lib.
2. cont. Douat Aug. ep. 165 and 42. and con. epist. Fund. c. 4. and in Psalm.
cont. part. Donat. Tert. de praescript. c. 36.
knitting together of the Church, and a most precious bond to preserve unity,
is the more carefully to be retained, and even in the evil Ministers of the
Church (as we said before) because of Gods ordinance is ever to be honored.
Which S. AUGUSTINE well understanding says: Into that Ep. 165. vide l. 2. con.
lit. Petil. c. 51
order of Bishops, which is derived from PETER himself, even to ANASTASIVS,
who now sits in the same Chair; If any Traitor had in those days crept
in: it had been nothing prejudicial unto the Church and unto Innocent
Christians: for whom our Lord was so careful and provident, that he says of
evil Prelates, Mat. 23, 3.
whatsoever they say, do ye; but according to their works do ye not. Thus
far Saint AUGUSTINE.

OF THE SACRAMENT OF MATRIMONY.
1 What is Matrimony?

MAtrimony, is a laweful Aug. li. de fid. and op. ca. 7. and lib. 1. de nupt.

Consanguinity and Affinity, and other things of the like sort, either
prohibiting, or disanulling Matrimony. Of which Matrimonial Conjunction, if
thou would know the first author, it is Genesis 2, 23. Mat. 19, 6. 1. Cor. 7,
10. Ephesians. 5, 21.
God himself, most excellent and mighty, who joined the first Couple and
Parents of mankind in Paradise it self, and honored them with his benediction.
But if thou regard the end why it was instituted, it is no other but the
propagation of Gen 2, 23 Fulg. ep. 1. cap. 3. Isid. lib. 2. offic. cap. 19.
mankind to the glory of God: and a familiar and faithful living together Chry

of Man and Wife: And finally, the avoiding 1. Cor. 7.9.10. Aug. li. 9. de Genesis

of fornication, in this imbecillitie of a corrupted nature.

2 How is Matrimony a Sacrament?

IN that the Amb. in cap. 5. Ephesians. Aug. vt supr. Isid. lib. 2. offic. ca. 19.
Conc. Flor. Trid. ses. 24. in Doct. de Sacr. Matr.
most strait conjunction, which is between Man and Wife, is an holy and
convenient sign ordained by God, whereby is signified the most holy and firm
conjunction of Christ the Bridegroom and the Church his Spouse. This very
sign profits unto Christian Couples, to receive the grace of God, when they
do rightly enterprise Tob. 3, 16. and 6, 16. and 8, 9. Euarist. ep. 1. Trid.

Matrimony. Which grace makes perfect Chrysostom. ho. 20. in ep. ad Ephesians Amb l. 1.
de Abrah. cap. 7.
natural love, and confirms an indissoluble unity between them, and
sanctifies them, that they may not only be, and abide Genesis 2, 24.
two in one flesh according to their vocation, but ever preserve mutual
fidelity, peace, love, and singular concord. And so that is accomplished in
them, which the Apostle teaches; Heb. 13, 4 Fulg. ep. 2. cap. 5.
Marriage honorable in all, and the bed undefiled.

Wherefore the same Apostle Ephesians. 5.32. Amb. ibid. Leo. ep. 92. ad Rust.
S. PAVL, where he handles the mystery of such conjunction, says plainly:
This is a great Sacrament: But I speak in Christ and in the Church. So also S.
AUGUSTINE: Not Lib. 1. de nupt. and concup. cap. 10. and 21.
only (says he) fruitefullnes; the profit whereof consists in Issue: not
only Chastity; whose band is fidelity: but also a certain Sacrament of
marriage is commended unto faithful couples. Whereupon the Apostle says, Ephesians.
5, 25.
Husbands love your wives as Christ also loved the Church. And Aug. li. de bono
coniu. cap. 18.
again the same holy Father: In marriage; of more value is the holiness of the
Sacrament then the fruitfullnesse of the womb.

3 Can Matrimony ever be dissolved?

THat Matrimony cannot be dissolved, but that the bond thereof is perpetual:
those words of the first man ADAM do declare: Genesis 2, 24
A man shall leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife, and they
two shall be in one flesh. Which thing Mat. 19, 5 Mar. 10, 7. Orig. tract. 7. in
Matthew.
Christ also confirmed, when he repeated the words of ADAM, even as the words
of God himself, adding this also; That which God has joined together, let not
man separate. And in an other place he teaches: Luc. 16, 18. Mar. 10, 11. Romans
7, 2. Can. Ap. 48, Ambr. in ca. 16. Luc.
Every one that dimisseth his wife, and marieth an other: commits aduoutrie:
and he that marieth her that is dimissed from her husband, commits
aduoutrie. Moreover S. PAVL setting forth this law of God, and inviolable
ordinance touching the perpetual firmnes of the knotte of wedlock, says: To
them 1. Cor. 7, 10. Aug. de adult. co^iug. lib. 2. cap. 5. and 9. and ho. 49.
ex 50. c. 2 Council. Mil. Can. 17.
that be joined in matrimony not I give commandment, but our Lord; that the
wife depart not from her husband: and if she depart, to remain unmarried, or
to be reconciled to her husband. And let not the husband put away his wife. And
afterward he adds: Ibid. Ver. 39. and Romans 7, 2.
A woman is bound to the law so long time as her husband lives.

Therefore, even although there be noe hope at all of any ishue, Aug. de bo.
coniu. c. 7.15.1^.24 Hier. in Epitaph Fabiol. cap. 1.

Isid. lib. 2. offic. cap. 19.


and never so many disco^modities of life and hard chances do fall out: yet
Matrimony once contracted stands in force, and is so firm and sure,
especially if it be consummate; that so long as life lasts, it can never be
dissolved. And for that cause, one party cannot wholly be divorced from the
other, unless happily it be, (before any carnal copulation had between
them) for to take in hand some rule Decret. lib. 3 tit. 32. c. 2. and 14. and
Trid. ses. 24. can. 6.
of religious life. But where certain causes do occur for which sometimes
married folks may be separated, the band is not therefore broken; but the Con.
^o^ Trid. sess. 24. can 7. and 8. Aug l. 1. de adult. con. cap. 11.
community of the bed, and cohabitation which was before, is hindered. The
cause whereof, we say, does consist in Christ himself who has joined, and
lincked unto himself with a speaciall, perpetual, and most inseparable union
the Church Ephesians. 5, 22.32. Cant. 5, 1.2.9.
his only spouse and ever most dear unto him. And not only this same
conjunction, which is between man and wife, has such firmness of a
matrimonial bond: but it does also utterly exclude, all polygamie, (that is to
wit) that diverse women do not marry to one man, Isid. lib. 3^ offic. cap. 19.
Trid. sess. 24. can. 2.
or one woman be espoused to diverse husbands. Wherefore Christ to the intent
that he might both more firmly establish and reduce matrimony to that more
pure, and primitive estate, which it had at the beginning: very significantlye
has said: Genesis 2, 24 Mat. 19, 5. Mar. 10, 7.
They two shall be in one flesh. And again: Now are they not two but one
flesh.

4 Is Matrimony permitted to every one?

NOe surely, for the holy Apostles have delivered, as Epiph. haer. 61. con.
Apostolicos.
EPIPHANIVS says, that it is a sin to turn unto marriage after Virginity
once decreed and established by vow. And S. HIEROME Hier. lib. 2 cont. Iouin.
cap. 7. Bas. de Virg^nitate. and ep. ad Virg. laps.
affirms it to be such and so great a sin, that he says, that Virgins
that marry after consecration they are not so much aduoutresses, as incestuous
persons. And S. AUGUSTINE says: In Psa. 83. vide eund. in Ps. 75. and de bono
viduit. cap 8.9.11. Oecum. in 1. Cor. 7. Cypr. ep. 62. Chry. de virg c. 39.
Fulg. ep. 1. c. 6. and 7
A Virgin, which if she had married had not sinned: being once a Nun; if she
marry, shall be reputed an aduoutresse from Christ. For she has looked back
from the place, unto which she came before.

Therefore that which the Apostle has: 1. Cor. 7, 9.
It is better to marry then to be burnt: (as S. AMBROSE does learnedly
declare) Lib ad Virg. laps. c. 5. Hier. lib. 1. in Iouin. ca. 7. Aug. lib. 1 de
adult. co^. c. 15. etc. 8. de bono viduit. Oecu^. in 1. Cor. 7. Isid. lib 2. de
offic. cap. 17 Leo. ep. 92. ad Rust. c. 14
appertains to her that is not yet promised; to her that has not as yet
received the veil. But she that has espoused her self to God, and has
received the holy veil: she is now married; she is now joined to an immortal
husband. And if now she will marry, according to the common law of wedlock:
she commits aduoutrie, she becomes the handmaide of death. Thus writes S.
AMBROSE.

Wherefore that was a very worthy decree of IOVINIAN the Emperor, Sozom. lib.
6. hist. c. 3. Niceph. l. 10. cap. 39.
and put into the Codex by the Emperor JUSTINIAN: L. Si qu^ C de Episc. and
Cler. 2 Turon. cap. 21.
If any man dare presume, I will not say to rauishe, but even to assail by
inticementes, holy Virgins for to marrye them: let him be punished with death.

Now the same reason in every respect and the same Judgment stands in force
concerning Basil. qu. 14. diff. expl. and ser. 1. de instit Mon. and constit.
Monast. ca. 22. and ep ad M^nachum claps. Chrysostom epist. 6 ad Theod. laps Leo. ep

ca. 4. Bern. sermon. c 5 in Cant. Trid. sess. 24. can. 9.
have received holy orders. For they have damnation, if letting lose the bridle
to licentiousnes, they frustrate or (as the Apostle speaks) 1. Tim. 5, 12.
Carthag 4 can. 104. Aug de bono Vid. cap. 8. and 9. Isid. lib. 2. offic. cap.
18.
make void their first faith given to God and to the Church. Who have
voluntarily barred themselves of wedlock, either expressly by vow binding
themselves to the observance of a sole and single life: or by taking of holy
orders, at the least virtually and in effect 6 Decret lib. 3. tit. 15.
approving and protesting the same.

Let them therefore give care unto the word of God. Eccles. 5, 3.
If thou have vowed any thing to God: delay not to perform. Ibid. and Deuteronomy.
23, 21
And whatsoever thou have vowed; do thou perform. Then in an other place: Ps.
75, 12
Vow ye, and pay your vows to your Lord God. Yea and Christ himself
teaches: Luc. 9, 62. Bern ep. 2. ad Fulconc. Ansel. ep. 4.
No man putting his hand to the plough, and loking back; is apt for the
kingdom of God.

5 Does the Church therefore compel any to live single?

SHe truly being a most kind and careful mother constrains not: as binding
no man by law to live single, but of those that have of their own accord
received that law (as has been said) she requires that they do not break
Beda. lib. 2. de tabern. cap. 9. and in Luc. 1. Hier. in cap. 1. ad Tit. and in
Apol cont. Iouin. c 3. and 8. Orig. ho. 23. in Number. Amb. ep. 82 and l. 1.
offic. cap. 50. Eusebius. 1. demonst. Eua. cap 9. vide Canolica did. 28. and 82.
Religion, nor violate and cut off that covenant which they have religiously
made with Christ and his Church.

Therefore are they justly urged to stand to their promises, and to keep that
Evangelical Council which they have once firmly embraced: whereof S. PAVL
says: And 1. Cor. 7, 38.
he that ioineth his Virgin in Matrimony, does well, (to wit, so long as she is
not bound Theoph. ibid. Hier. lib. 1. cont. Iouin. ca. 7. Greg. in. ca. 15. l.
1. Reg. Epiph. haer. 61.
with the vow of single life) and he that ioineth not, does better. And again:
Ibid. v. 1.
It is good for a man not to touch a woman. For Mat. 19, 12.
which cause, the Evangelical Eunuchs Esa. 56, 3. and ibi Hier. Bas. l. de
Virginit. Aug. de san. Virg. ca. 24. and 25.
or as TERTVLLIAN Lib. 1. ad Vx. cap. 6.
calls them, Voluntarij spadones, that have cut themselves for the kingdom
of heaven, that they may be holy 1. Cor. 7, 34.
in body and spirit; in flesh, and yet without flesh, warfaring unto God: are
both commended by Christ: and have always been highly commended in the
Church. And in this matter, is a double error that we have to take heed of:
The one is of those men which with IOVINIAN do so extol Matrimony, that they
either Hier. li. 1. in Iouin. c. 2 Aug. haer. 82
match, or Trid. ses. 24. cap. 10.
prefer this estate before single-life or Virginity: whereas 1. Cor. 7, 38.
S. PAVL certes, and all the Fathers do evidently affirm the contrary.
Another is of those which cauil, that co^tinency and single life can hardly be
performed by Christian men, and therefore they contend that no man ought easily
to undertake it, or religiously to promise it. For these me^ understand not,
the plenty and abundance, of the grace of the Gospel: which is such, and so
great, given by Christ so many Ages, and daily given to those that believe, Aug
l. 6. and 8. conf. c. 11. Orig. Hier. Chrysostom. in Mat. 19.
ask, seek and knock: that these men find the yoke of our Lord sweet; and
the way of continency, no less pleasant, tha^ wholesome. In the number of whom
S. PAVL was, who plainly affirms. 1. Cor. 10, 13.
God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that which you are
able: but will make also with temptation, Ishue. Wherefore S. AUGUSTINE
explicating Aug. in Psalm. 75.
in a certain place this sentence, Vow, and pay your vows unto our Lord God:
writes thus: Be ye not slothful to Vow: for you shall not, by your own
strength fulfill the same. You shall sail, if you presume of your selves. But if
you presume of him to whom you do vow: spare not to vow: you shall perform it
with security. And again in another place: Ep. 45.
A happy necessity which forces a man to that which is better.

6 What is the summary Doctrine of the Premises?

THose things that have been hitherto spoken according to our purposed
breuity; are only to this end, that the simpler sort may have the Catholic
verity, touching the seven Sacraments of the Church. Which are found,
certes, to be of two sorts.

For Conc. Flor.
some, as the first five do advance the particular welfare of every faithful
man: And the rest (to wit the two latter) do serve for the multiplying of Gods
people, and propagation of the Church. Both which effects they do work by
Gods holy ordinance for our behoof most necessary.

For, Io. 3, 5. Tit. 3, 5.
Baptism does regenerate to the spiritual life, which is in Christ.
Confirmation does add force and Act. 8, 17.
strength unto the regenerate. The Eucharist is meat, Io. 6, 51.55.
drink, and voyage provision unto the waifaring man. Penance being a present
Io. 20, 23. Ezech. 18, 30.31.
remedy against all the maladies of the mind, does erecte a man when he is
fallen, and cure him when he is wounded. Then succedeth Iac. 5, 15.
Extreme Unction, which in the last conflicte with death, does fence and
comfort the Passenger. Then holy Orders Tit. 1.5. 1. Cor. 4, 1.
yields Ministers unto the Church, which may have authority in holy things,
and may rightly govern, dispense, conserve, and apply, all those things which
we spoke of before. Finally Matrimony, increases the Ephesians. 5, 32. 1. Cor. 7, 2.

Where also this difference is to be observed, that Baptism, Confirmation, and
Orders, being once given, can never be Council. Flor. Trid. sess. 7. Can. 9. de

These are therefore the preservatives and divine remedies, which that
Samaritane Luc. 10, 33. 1. Cor. 4, 1. Io. 20, 23.
full of all mercy has ordained, and committed to the Prelates of the Church
to be dispensed, for the well curing undoubtedly of the sick, that is to say
of all sinners in the Church, even until that, they obtain if they will their
true and perfect health. Which remedies rightly to understand, holsomely to
receive, and faithfully to apply unto others: is not a point certes of humane
cunning, but of Christian wisdom. Of which whereas we have now spoken enough,
according unto the scope of our present purpose: It now remainethe that by the
help of Christ, we pass over to the other part of this work, which
contains Christian Justice.

JUSTICE.
1 What things do belong to Christian Justice.

ALL such things may be reduced unto two points, Aug. ser. 19. de temp.
Chrysostom in Ps. 4. and ho. 16. in epist. ad Ephesians. Prosp. sent. 98. ex. Aug.
which are comprehended in these words. Psalm. 36, 27. and 33, 15 1. Pet. 3,
10.11. Tob. 4, 13.
Decline thou from evil, and do good: as also ESAIAS teaches: Esa. 1, 16 Eccli.
3, 32. To. 12, 10.
Cease ye to do peruersely, and learn to do well. This is that which Col.
3, 8. Ephesians. 4, 16.17.18.19.20
S. PAVL admonishes, that the old man with his acts must be put off, and the
new man must be put on, in Justice and Holiness of truth. The first
consists in knowing and eschuing sins, for they are unto mortal men the
greatest evils that can be. And the latter stands in the desire and pursuit
of things that be good.

But to the intent that we may perform Bern. ser. 1. de Pentec.
both these offices appertaining to Justice; Gods grace has been by JESUS
CHRIST purchased and promised unto us, and is ever most necessary. By means
of which, both preventing us, Aug. de great and lib. arbit, ca 9. 15. and 16.
Ite^ in Ench. c. 32. Hier lib. 2. in Iouin. cap 2. Conc. Trid. sess. 6. can. 2.
and cooperating with us: that effect is wrought in us which S. IHON
affirms: 1. Io. 3, 8.
He that does Justice is just: even as he also is just. Moreover he adds: He
that commits sin, is of the Devil.

2 What is sin?

Sin (as witnesses S. AUGUSTINE) Lib. de duab. anim. c. 11. and l 1.
retract. c. 15 and 13. lib de Genesis ad lit. imperf. c. 1.
is a will to retain or obtain that which Justice prohibiteth, and from which
it is in man's power to abstain. And in an other place he teaches, that, sin
Lib. 22. cont. Faust. ca. 27. lib. 1. contr. 2. ep. Pelag. c. 13.
is, whatsoever is spoken, done or desired contrary to the law of God. And
Saint AMBROSE: What is sin Lib. de Paradiso. c. 8. Aug. lib. 2 de consens.
Euang. c. 4. Bed. in ca. 3. ep. 1 Joan.
says he, but the transgression of Gods law, and the disobaying of the
heavenly precepts.

3 How many kind of sins be there?

THree, Aug. in Ench. c 64.
Original, Mortal, and Venial.

The first we call Original, which Trid. conc. ses. 5.
being transfused, by ADAM the first Father of mankind; and contracted by us
in our very conception: Ps. 50, 7.
is taken away by Baptism in Christ.

Whereof, S. PAVL speaks in this manner: To. 5, 12.
By one man sin entered into this world, and by sin death: and so unto all
men death did pass, in which all sinned. And again, speaking unto the
Baptized, to the intent that he might show, that the force of Christian
Baptism did extend to the purging of this sin also; he plainly testifies:
You 1. Cor. 6, 11.
are washed, you are sanctified, you are justified in the name of our Lord
JESUS CHRIST, and in the spirit of our God.

But Mortal sin; is that actual sin (as they call it) which takes away
spiritual life, and brings the death of the soul of him that sins: which
death, separateth a man from God and his 1. Cor. 6, 9. Gal. 5, 19 Apoc. 21, 8.
kingdom, and makes him worthy of everlasting punishment. Whereupon it is
written; The To. 6, 23
stipend of sin, death. Sap. 1, 16.
Injustice, is the procurement of death: and the ungodly have invited her, with
hands and words.

Finally, a venial sin is certes actual, but it is such a sin as does not
make a man the enemy of God, and whereof, pardon is easily obtained by the
faithful at Gods hand. Of this has S. IHON said: 1 Io. 1, 6. Aug. lib. 3.
cont. 2. ep. Pelag. c. 3.
If we shall say that we have no sin, we seduce our selves, and the truth
is not in us. And S. JAMES confesses plainly: Iac. 3, 2.
In many things we offend all. And if we believe the wise man: The Pro. 24,
16. Eccles. 7, 21.
Just man falls seven times a day, and risethe again

Now, it is manifest that one sin is more Io. 19, 12.
grievous than another: and it is agreeable both to humane and divine Justice
also, that a greater punishment Aug. lib. 21. ciu. c. 16. and ser. 18. de verb.
Apost. cap. 4.
is due to the greater sin. And for that cause has Christ put this difference,
between the fault and the punishment of one that sins wittingly, and of
another that sins unwittingly: Luc. 12, 47.
That servant, says he, that knew the will of his Lord, and prepared not
himself, and did not according to his will: shall be beaten with many stripes.
But he that knew not, and did things worthy of stripes: shall be beaten
with few. And in another place, speaking of the sin of Anger, and the
degrees thereof, he has given this sentence: Mat. 5, 23.
Whosoever is angry with his brother, shall be in danger of judgment: and
whosoever shall say to his brother Raca: shall be in danger of a Council: and
whosoever shall say thou fool: shall be guilty of the hell of fire. Where, as
Greg. 21. moral. c. 5. Aug. li. 1. de ser. Dom. in monte. c. 9.
S. GREGORY says, According to the degrees of the fault, increases the order
of the sentence: whilst Anger without voice; is bound to judgment, wherein the
case is discussed: Anger in voice; is designed to a Counsel, where the sentence
is determined: Anger in voice and word, is adjudged to hell fire: where finally
the sentence is executed

Eccle. 15, 21
4 Why is sin to be eschewed?

FIrst, because God has commanded none to do wickedly, and has given no man
space to sin, but Psalm. 5, 7. Eccli. 12, 3. Sap. 14, 9. Pro. 15, 8.9. Exodus
23, 7.
hates all those that work iniquity.

As the Scripture expressly testifies. Neithr is any thing more odious and
hateful to God, who Sap. 11, 25.
otherwise loves all things that are, and prosecuteth nothing with hatred and
punishment, but only sin, which truly neither in Esa. 14, 11.12. 2. Pet. 2, 4,
5.6.7.
heaven, nor in earth, he suffers to escape unpunished.

Moreover, sin, Leu. 26, 14 15. Deuteronomy. 28, 15 16.
(that we may see how execrable and abominable a thing it is:) was the Bern.
ser. 3. de not. do.
cause that Christ our Lord, who otherwise committed no 1. Pet. 2, 21.
sin himself, did undertake the CROSS, and suffer a most bitter death.
For; Esa. 53, 5
He was wounded for our iniquities, he was worn out for our wickedness: our
Lord laid upon him the iniquity of us all: He 1. Io. 2, 2
is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the
whole worlds.

And therefore, certes, he has washed Apoc. 1, 5
us from our sins in his blood, that as many as ever are buried with him by
Baptism To. 6, 2.
into death, they being 1. Pet. 2, 13.
dead to sin, may live to Justice and always walk by his grace in To. 6, 4.
newness of life. But they that after grace received in the Baptism of
Christ, will voluntarilye sin again: they sin against Christ, they
persecute Christ, they crucify Christ again, and shall be punished by Christ the
just Judge, no less then the wicked Heathens. For so S. PAVL teaches: Heb.
10, 26.
If we sin willingly, after the knowledge of the truth received, now there
is not left an host for sins, but a certain terrible expectation of
judgment. Of which persons the Apostle S. PETER has also said: 2. Pet. 2,
21.
It was better for them not to know the way of Justice, then after the
knowledge to turn back from that holy commandment which was delivered unto
them. Wherefore he that stands, 1. Cor. 10, 12. Luc. 11, 26. Mat. 12, 45.
let him look that he do not fall, for in falling the latter things are
become worse then the former. Moreover, Tob. 12, 10.
they which commit sin and iniquity are enemies to their own soul; if we
believe the Angel RAPHAEL. Sap. 16, 14.
For a man by malice kills his own soul. Ezech. 18, 4. Iac. 1, 15. Psalm. 33,
22. To. 6, 23.
The soul which shall sin, she shall die. And nothing certes is more
unhappy then that death, by which a man is forever separated from the company
of all the Saints, from the joy of the Angels and all heavenly Inhabitants,
and finally from that so sovereign and eternal Mat. 7, 23. and 25, 11 Luc.
13, 27. Psalm. 6, 9. Chrysostom. ho. 24. in Mat. and 48. ad pop. Ite^ ep. 5. ad Theod
laps.
good, in the knowledge and fruition whereof, consists certes the whole
welfare and perfect blessedness of a man.

Besides all this, such is the nature and malignitie of sin, that it does not
only draw men even those that be Just, Ezec 18, 24.33, 12.
from God, and from the grace and glory of God: but does moreover inthrall them
to most extreme and everlasting evils both of body and soul: and not only in
this life Iudit. 5, 18. Ezod. 32, 33 Number. 14, 28. Eccli. 21, 4. Psalm. 10, 6.
Luc. 16, 22.23.
but also in the life to come, it makes them most unhappy: insomuch as being
brought into the power of the Devils, they are delivered up to most greiuous
torments and all manner of evils for evermore. Wherefore, are those examples to
be noted, which every where in holy writ are mentioned, concerning the
reprehension and punishment of sinners: as of Genesis 4, 11.12.
CAIN, Exodus 14, 27.
PHARAO, Da^* 4, 22
NABVCHODONOSOR, the Genesis 19, 24. Ezech. 16, 49.
SODOMITES, Exodus 7, 8.9.10.12.14.
EGYPTIANS, Deuteronomy. 23, 22. Number. 16, 26.
ISRAELITS and others, whose wickedness, the just God has persecuted in most
marueilouse and horrible manner. Those sentences also are to be observed, which
teach that the mischeuous pestilence of sin is to be eschewed and detested.
As: Io. 8, 34.
he that commits sin is the servant of sin; Hateful unto God Sap. 14, 9
is the wicked man and his wickedness. Sin Pro. 14, 34.
makes people miserable. Eccli. 21, 2.
Fly from sin as from the face of an adder. Ps. 5, 5.6.
Thou art a God that wills not iniquity, neither shall the maliciouse dwell
near unto thee, neither shall the unjust abide in thy sight. Eccles. 9, 18.
He that shall sin in one thing, shall lose many good things. Tob. 4, 6.7.
vid. Chris. hom. 8. ad pop. Antio. 17. in Genesis 51. and 37. in Io. 28. in ep. ad
To. 41. in Act. and ho. de Iona. Proph. Bas. ho. in Ps. 33. Aug. propos 42. ex
ep. ad Roman.
All the days of thy life have thou God in mind, and take heed that thou do
not at any time consent unto sin, and ouerpasse the precepts of our God.
These things do tend to this end, that a man may know God a most just
revenger of sin: and knowing him may fear him: and fearing him may have
regard to his own salvation: and by regarding; may escape the horrible pains
of sinners. For, Psalm. 31, 10.
many are the scourges of a sinner.

5 What way leads unto sin?

BY three Aug. lib. de ser. do. in monte. c. 12. and l. 12. de Trin. c. 12.
Greg. ho. 16. in Euang. and l. 4. mor. cap 27.
degrees espeaciallie, we do fall into sin: by Suggestion, Delectation, and
Consent.

By Suggestion certes of the enemy: whilst an evil cogitation, or tentation
either by the world, the flesh, or the devil is thrust into us: and by our
own delectation; when that pleases too much the mind, which an evil
tentation suggesteth: and finally, with our own consent also; whenas the will
being allured; consents deliberately to the sin it self: by which consent,
the sin is now Iac. 1, 14 and ibid. Beda Tob. 4, 6. To. 6, 12. Mar. 5, 23.
consummate, so that it does not only make a man unclean and unjust, and slay
him spiritually: but also makes him gilty of hell before God although it be not
always accomplished in act. And therefore not in vain is it said: Greg. ad
interrog. 11. Augustini Cantuar.
that in suggestio^ is the seed, in delectatio^ the nutriment, in consent the
perfection of sin.

And if we do exactly consider, which are wont to be the degrees of sin:
we shall find, that first, vide Greg. l. 4. mor. c. 27. and Isid. l. 2. de
sum. bo. c. 23
of suggestion, there arises cogitation; of cogitation, affection; of
affection, delight; of delight, consent; of consent, work; of work, custom;
of custom, despair; of despair, defending of sin; of defending, boasting;
of boasting, damnation. This is that long and horrible cheine of sins: these
be the Pro. 5, 22 Psalm. 118, 61. 2. reg. 11, 6. vide Aug. l. 8. conf. c. 5.
Greg. l. 25. mor. c. 12.
ropes and fetters, wherewith a man being bound, Satan does miserably cast
him down hedlong here into all manner of mischief, and at the last in to the
bottomless pit of Hell. And therefore is it very requisite, to discern and
observe very dilligentlye these degrees and branches of sins, that we be not
thereby deceived and endaungered.

6 How are sins easily avoided?

FIrst certes, if we do foresee the evils and dangers which do follow after
sin: then if we do presently stop, Psalm. 136, 9. Iac. 4, 7. 1. Pet. 5, 8.
Ber. ser. 5. de quadrag. and 29. ex paruis and 49. in cant
and mightily resist their evil entrances and suggestions, by which we are
easily solicited to sin: last of all, if we do endeavor to Practice the
virtues, To. 12, per totum. Ephesians. 4, per totum. Phil. 4, 5.8.
contrary to these sins: Christ in all these things assisting us.

Wherefore the Ecclesiasticus gives warning: Eccli. 18, 30.
Do thou not go after thy concupiscences; and from thy own will, see thou
turn away: if thou do grant unto thy soul her concupiscences; she will
cause the to be a joy to thy enemies: And hereupon it is also pronounced by a
divine oracle: Gen, 4, 7.
Shall thou not if thou do well, receive well? but if evil; thy sin shall
presently be in the gates, but under thee shall be the appetite thereof and thou
shall have dominion over it.

Ephesians. 6, 11 Heb. 12, 3.
And here, that spiritual armor takes place, wherewith S. PAVL will have the
soldiers of Christ to be guarded, against sin and all the deceipts of the
devil, that they may strive again sin, resist in the evil day, and
extinguish all the darts of the most wicked one.

OF THF SEVEN CAPITAL SINS.
1 Which are the sins, that are speacially to be noted?

Truly, those, that are called Capital, because they are, as it were the
fountains or heads of all the rest, and out of which as out of a corrupted
root, very pestilent fruits do spring, and as it were by a long race, all
kind of vices, and turpituds, scandales, harms, corruptions, and mischeifs of
mankind, do descend, and break out with great violence.

2 How many such capital sins are there?

vide Greg. l. 3. mor. c. 31 and Cassia collat. 5. and l. 5. and sequen.
Seven; which are numbered in this manner: Pride, Covetousness, Lechery, Envy,
Glotonie, Anger, Sloth. But as these are ever to be detested and eschewed; so
the seven virtues opposite unto these vices, are to be followed with very great
diligence and affection, if we seek the life of our soul. To Pride; contrary
is Colos. 3, 12.
Humility: to Covetousness; 2. Cor. 9, 5.
Liberality: to Lechery; Act. 24, 25.
chastity: Charity 1. Cor. 13 4.
oppugneth Envy: Abstinence Eccli. 31, 19.31.
is opposite to Glotonie: Patience Heb. 10, 36.
to Anger: finally Devotion 1. Cor. 15, 58.
or Godly diligence, and diligent piety expels Sloth.

3 What is Pride, and what daughters does she beget?

PRide Vide Chrysostom. ho. 43 ad pop. Antioch. Ber. de grad. humil. Greg, 34. mor.
c. 17. and seq. and l. 23. c. 7. Pros. ad Demet. Isid. de su^mo bono l. 2. c.
38. Fulg. ep. 3. c. 16. and 17.
is an inordinate appetite of excellencye, whether it lurk in the mind or
appear in out ward show.

She certes is the mother, prince Greg. l. 31 mor. c. 31. Prosp. lib. 3. de
vit. cont. cap. 2. Aug. ep. 56. Ber. ser. 3. ex paruis and ser 4. de adu.
and Queen of all vices, which principally begets this unhappy offspring;
Deuteronomy. 17, 12. Sap. 5, 8. Mat. 23, 11.14.27.. Prou. 13, 10. Genesis 49, 7. Prou. 6,
16. 1. Tim. 5, 13.
Disobedience, boasting, Hypocrysie, contention, pertinacie, discord,
curiosity.

And to the intent that we might avoid this most Pestiferous sin; holy
TOBIE, gives warning in this manner: Do thou never permit Tob. 4, 14.
Pride to bear rule in thy thought or in thy word: for in it all perdition
took the beginning. Eccli. 10, 15. Chrysostom. ho. 8. in Joan
For this cause is that Apostolical doctrine: God resists the proud Iac. 4,
6. 1. Pet. 5, 5.
and gives grace to the humble. Yea and if we believe Ecclesiasticus: Pride is
hateful before God, Eccli. 10, 7.18.10.
and men. God has dried up the roots of proud nations and has planted the
humble out of those nations. Why therefore art thou proud thou dust and ashes?

4 What is Covetousness and of what manner of daughters is she the mother?

Covetousness is an inordinate appetite of having. vide Bas. in ditescent. and
auar. ho. 6. and 7. Pros. l. 2. de vita cont. c. 15 and 16. Isid. de sum. bo.
l. 2. c. 41. Aug. l. ^. de lib. arb. c. 17. and ser. 196. de te^p. Ambr. in lib
de Nabuthe Iezrael. l. 1. de Cain and Abel. cap. 5.
For he is rightly deemed couetouse, not only that takes by violence, but also
that desires an other man's, or couetously keeps his own.

The Greg. lib. ^1. mor. c. 31 2. Tim. 3, 4. 1. Cor. 6, 8. Eccli. 11, 31.33.
Zach. 8, 17. Mat. 6, 24. Pro 22, 22. and 21, 13.
daughters of this bad mother, are Treason, fraud, fallacy, Perjury,
Disquietnes, violence, vnmercifullnes, or Inhumanitie, and hardness of heart:
The Apostle condemns this vice, so as he has called it the service of Col.
3, 5. Ephesians. 5, 5.
Idols: 1 Timothy 6 9. Esa. 5, 8. Mar. 10, 24. Abac. 2, 6.9. Iac. 5, 1. Eccli.
31, 5.8 11. Bar. 3, 16 Psalm. 48, 17.
and besides writeh thus. They that willbe made rich, fall into tentation and
the snare of the Devil, and many desiers unprofitable and hurtful, which
drown men into destruction and perdition. For the root of al evils is
covetousness. And in an other place we find it written: nothing is more wicked
then a Couetouse Eccli. 10, 9.10.
man. Also nothing is more unjust then to love money. For this man sets his
very soul to sale. And Christ him self testifies: you cannot serve God Mat.
6, 25. Chrysostom. ho. 7. in Io. Ibidem ver. 34.
and mammon. And again: be not careful for to morrow. Which Saint PAVL also
more expressly delivering, gives this admonition: Heb. 13, 5. Luc. 12, 15.
Let your manners be without avarice: contented with things present. For he
said, I will not leave thee, neither will I forsake thee: so that we do
confidently say: Our Lord is my helper: Having 1. Tim. 6, 8.
food and wherewith to be covered, with these we are content.

5 What is Lechery, and what manner of offspring does it engender?

Lechery, vide pros de vit. cont. l. 3. c. 6. Isid. de sum. bo. l. 2. c. 39.
is an inordinate appetite of unclean and libidinouse pleasure. And it Greg.
lib. 31 mor. c. 31. Ose. 4, 11 2. Reg. 11, 14. Dan. 13, 56. Pro. 13, 3 Sap. 4,
12. Psalm. 51, 6. 2. Tim. 3, 4. Psalm. 20, 9. Iac. 4, 4. Ephesians. 4, 19.
brings forth blindness of mind, inconsideratio^, inconstancy, headlongnes,
love of himself, hatred of God, too much desire of this life, a horror of
death and future Judgment, and desperation of eternal felicity.

Against this sin which makes 3. Reg. 11 1. Eccli. 19.2 Hier. in cap 4. Ose.
Amb. l. 1. de Cain and Abel. c. 5. and l. de Noe. and area. cap. 9.
the wise mad; and causes men to become in manner beasts: thus writes S.
PAVL: Fly 1. Cor. 6.18. and ibid. Chrysostom. Aug. de 10. chord. c. 10. and ser.
16. de ver. do c. 10
fornication. Every sin whatsoever a man does, is without the body: but he
that does fornicate, sins against his own body. And in another place thus:
Ephesians. 5, 3. and ibi Hiero^ vide sextum preceptum Decalogi.
Fornication and all uncleanness, or avarice, let it not so much as be named
among you, as becomes Saints: or filthiness, or foolish talk, or scurrilitie,
being to no purpose: but rather giving of thanks. And it is a wonderful thing
that Christians are not marueilously Amb. in c. 4. Luc. Greg. 16. mor. c. 31.
ashamed: who do pollute themselves with filthy lust in the sight of God and
his Angels, whereas they have consecrated in Baptism their bodies and members
as pure temples 1. Cor. 5, 16. 2. Cor. 6, 16.
to the holy Ghost, and to Christ our Lord. Hereupon again says S. PAVL. Know
1. Cor. 6.19.
you not that your members are the temple of the holy Ghost, which is in you,
whom you have of God, and you are not your own? Then again; Know Ibid. Ver.
15.
you not that your bodies are the members of Christ? Taking therefore the
members of Christ, shall I make them the members of an harlotte? And finally
he concludes in this sort: For you are Ibid. Ver. 20.
bought with a great price. Glorify and bear God in your body. For Heb. 13,
4 1. Cor. 6, 9. Ephesians. 5, 5. Gal. 5, 20. Apoc. 21, 8.
fornicatours, and aduouterours, God will judge.

6 What is Envy, and what daughters does she bring forth?

Envy, de hoc peccato scribit Cypr. ser. de zelo and li uorc. Bas. ho. 11. de
inuid. and 21. in aliquot. scripturae locos Chrysostom. hom. 44. and 45. ad pop.
Prosp. l. 3. de vita conte^p. c. 5. and 9. Isid. de surn. bo. l. 3, c. 25.
is a sadness for the good of an other, and a hatred of an other man's
felicity: in respect of Superiors; because he is not made equal unto them:
and in respect of inferiors; least they should be made equal unto him: and in
respect of equals; because they are equal unto him, as Saint AUGUSTINE Aug.
l. 11 de Genesis ad li. et. 14. Prosp. Sent. 292.
says: and she has to her Greg. l. 31 mor. c. 31. 1. Io. 3, 12. To. 1, 29.
Pro. 17, 5. et 24, 17.21. et 28, 22. Eccles. 4, 4.
daughters: hatred, whispering, detractio^, exulting in other men's adversities,
and aflictio^ in their prosperity.

CAIN is read to have envied ABEL Genesis 4, 5. Iudae ver. 11
his own brother, and SAVL to have envied DAVID 1. Reg. 18, 8.
the designed King, his son in law. This abominable vice besides Nysse. in

that it is void of all charity and humanity: it also makes men most like
unto Devils. For by the envy of the Sap. 2, 24. Chrysostom. ho. 41. in Mat. Greg.
l. 5. mor. c. 33. and 34. and l. 29. c. 3. Aug. de virg. c. 31
Devil death entered into the world: and they do imitate him, which are of
his part. Well therefore, does the Apostle give warning: Gal. 5, 26.
Let us not be made desirous of vain glory, provoking one an other, envying
one an other.

7 What is Glotony, and which are her daughters?

GLotonie is an inordinate Greg. 30. mor. c. 27. Ber. l. de pas. c. 42.
appetite of meat and drink: her daughters Greg. lib. 31. mor. c. 31
are, foolish mirth, Exo. 32, 6 Job. 21, 12. Pro. 10, 19. Ephesians. 5, 4. Greg 3.

and seq.
uncleanness, dulnes of sense, and understanding. And what is more foul and
unseemly then that a man should be inferior to beasts, which are content with
a certain natural moderation; whilst he makes himself a slave to his
belly, to surfeting and drunckennes, consuming his goods, hurting his health,
bringing on diseases, and finally shortning and cutting off his own life? For
it is a very true saying: By means Eccli. 37, 32. and 31, 19. ps. 77, 29. Number.
11, 33. Deuteronomy. 12, 15. Prou. 21, 17.
of surfeiting many have died: but he that is abstinent shall increase life.
Again: In much Eccli. 37, 33
meat there shall be infirmity. Therefore Christ commands: Look well Luc. 21,
34. Vide Bur char. l. 34. de cret. et Iuon. part 13. c. 68. and sequ.
to your selves, least perhaps your hearts be ouercharged with surfeting, and
drunckennes. And Saint PAVL dehorting us from drunckenes says: Ephesians. 5, 18.
Pro. 20, 1 Hier. in c. 1. ad Tit. and ep 83. ad Ocea. c. 4 Ambr. l. 1 de
paenit. c. 14.
Be not druncke with wine wherein is riotousnes. 1. Cor. 6, 10. Gal. 5, 11 Ose.
4, 11. Pro. 31, 4. Eccli. 19, 2.
Drunckerds shall not possese the kingdom of God. And hence is it also that the
Prophet gives such a heavy threate unto drunckerds: Woe Esa. 5, 22 11. et 22,
12. Pro. 23, 20.29. Amos. 6, 4. Luc. 6, 24.
you that are mighty to drink wine, and strong men to mingle drunckennes.

8 What is Anger and what offspring has she?

Anger, is an inordinate desire of punishing him, by whom a man supposes that
he have been harmed. There does spring Greg. l. 31. mor. c. 31 Pro. 29, 22. Job.
15, 2.13. Eccli. 19, 28. Ephesians. 4, 31.
from her these detestable daughters: Braulinge, Swelling of the mind,
Contumelies, clamor, disdainfulnesse, and Blasphemy.

This is a pernicious poison of lege Bas. ho. 10. de ira Chrysostom. ad pop. ho 29.
and seq. and ho 6 in act. 4. and 18. in Mat. Greg. l. 5. mor. c. 30. and sequ.
the mind, overthrowing al vigor of judgment and wisdom, and impairing the
health of the mind, yea and oftentimes also of the body. For which cause has
Ecclesiastes given warning: Be not Eccles. 7, 10. Eccli. 8, 19. and 28, 1. and
30, 26. Pro. 12, 16. and 15, 1.18. and 18, 6.14. and 22, 24. and 26, 21. and
27, 3. Job. 5, 2. Ps. 4, 5. and 30, 10.
thou swifte to be angry, for anger rests in the bosom of a fool. And the
doctor of the Gentiles has given charge: Let Ephesians. 4, 31. Col. 3, 8.12. Ber.
ser. 13. in Ps. Qui habitat. Amb. lib. 1. off. c. 21 August. in. Psalm. 4. and
lib. de vera relig. cap. 45. and epist. 87. and 149. Greg. lib. 8. ep 51. ad
Leont. and par. 3. past. adm. 17.
all bit ternes, and anger, and indignation, clamor and blasphemy, be taken
away from you with all malice. And be gentle one to another, merciful,
pardoning one another, as also God in Christ has pardoned you. But against
angrye, contentiouse, and contumelious persons, that dreadful sentence of
Christ is already pronounced: Whosoever Mat. 5.23 Greg. l. 21. mor. c. 5. Aug.
l. 1. de ser. dom. in monte c. 19. Enchir. c. 79.
is angry with his brother, shall be in danger of judgment: and whosoever
shall say to his brother, Raca; shall be in danger of a Council: And whosoever
shall say thou fool; shall be guilty of hell fire.

9 What is Sloth, and which be her branches? Ber. ser. 3. and 6. de ascens.
Greg. 3. part past. admon. 16.


SLoth is a languishing of a mind that is slack and negligent to do well: And
speacially it is a sadness about some spiritual matter. She brings forth
Greg. 31. mor. c. 31 Eccli. 33, 29. Pro. 15, 13. Eccli. 7.9. and 30, 22. Pro.
17, 22. Psalm. 118, 28 and 39, 13.
these daughters, malice, rancour, pusillanimitie, desperation, dulnes about
the necessary commandments, and a wandering of the mind about things
unlawful.

Of this sin are those men guilty, that are Mat. 20, 3.6. and 22.5.
Idle, lither, and as the Scripture calls them, luke warm Ap. 3, 15 Pro. 6,
3. and 10, 4.26. and 13, 4. and 18, 8.9. and 19, 15 24. and 20, 4. and 21, 25.
and 22, 13. and 24, 30. and 25, 20. and 26, 13. and 28, 19. Eccli. 5, 8. and 7,
16. and 14, 2. et 22, 1 Psalm. 72, 5. Hier. 48, 10. iuxta 70. To. 13, 11. 2.
Cor. 7, 10 Gal. 3, 3. Apoc. 2, 4.
and finally every one that does pass over this time of grace and day of
salvation in vain affairs and endeuoures. And the end of this sin is that
which Christ teaches in the Gospel: Every tree Mat. 7, 18. and 3, 10 and 21,
19. Luc. 13, 7. Io. 15, 2.
which yields not good fruit shall be cut down, and shall be cast into the
fire. And in an other place: The Mat. 25, 26, 30.
unprofitable servant cast ye out into the utter darkness. Eccli. 6, 23 Eccles.
9, 10, 2. These. 3, 7. Gal. 6.9, 10. Heb. 12, 12. To. 12, 11. Phil. 4, 4.
Neither has he omitted to tell us, what in the mean season he would have us
to do, that we may eschew sloth, saying: Take heed, Mar. 13, 33.35. Mat. 24,
42. and 25 13. Io. 9, 4 Ephesians. 5, 14.16 Ap. 3, 2.3.
watch and pray, for you know not when the time is: strive to enter by Luc, 13,
24. Mat. 7, 13. and 11, 12
the narrow gate, because many I say to you shall seek to enter, and shall not
be able. These things we have briefly touched to the intent that they which
are not already taught the ways of Justice, may not only know and discern
the chief diseases and detestable plagues of mankind which we have showed: but
also endeavor according to the prescript of Gods law, to abandon from
themselves and others, and utterly to expel the same. Happy Psalm. 1, 1. Bern.
ser. 35. ex paruis.
is that man which has not walked in the Council of the wicked, and has not
stood in the way of sinners, and has not sit in the chair of pestilence,
as the Kingly Psalmist sings: notefying unto us the first part of Justice
and happiness, in the front of his first Canticle.

OF ALIEN SINS.
1 What sins are called Alien sins?

THose, which although they be wrought and accomplished by the hands and
deeds of other men, yet they are worthily imputed unto us, and do make our
consciences guilty of damnation in the sight of God. And therefore of this may
that be understood which the scripture commands: Do 1. Tim. 5, 22. vide Bas.
de uera virg
thou not communicate with other men's sins: And that which the Kingly Prophet
praieih: From Psalm. 18, 13. and ibid. Euthim. Aug. l. 3. de. lib. arb. c. 10
my secret sins cleanse me o Lord, and from alien sins spare thy seruante.
Heereunto ser. 2. de bap. cap. 9. Aug. ser. 18. de ver Do. cap. 18.
does S. BASIL the great refer that which S. PAVL wrote to the EPHESIANS:
Communicate not Ephesians. 5, 11.
with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them. Then that
also of the same Apostle: Withdraw 2 Thessalonians. 3, 6.
your selves from every brother walking inordinately, and not according to the
Tradition which they have received of us.

2 How many in number are these alien sins?

NIne; as they are for the most part committed nine manner of ways: to wit,
by council: by commanding: by consent: by provocation: by praise or flattery:
by silence: by winking, or Indulgence: by participation in the fault: and by
wicked defending or maintaining the same.

Eccli. 27, 28. and 6, 7. and 8, 20. and 37, 7.9. Job. 5, 13. and 12, 13.16.
and 18, 5.7. Esa. 19, 11.13. Psalm. 7, 16. and 9, 16. Prou. 26, 27. Eccles. 10,
8.
3 When is an alien sin committed by Council?

AT such time certes, as we are the authors and instruments of evil counsel,
which others do or may follow. Let CAIPHAS be an example: Io. 11, 49
who by his counsel incensed and provoked the Senate of the Jews to work the
death of Christ. But commended on the contrary part is JOSEPH of Aramathia,
and is called a good and just man, because he had not consented Luc. 23, 50.
Psalm. 1, 1. Genesis 49, 5. Job. 21, 16.
to the counsel and acts of them, to wit, of the high Preistes and Pharisees
wickedlye conspiring to put Christ to Io. 11, 53. Mat. 26, 3.
death. Of the same sort of men was that Act. 19, 24. 2. Reg. 10, 3. and 16,
20. and 17, 1.5 3. Reg. 12, 4. and 21, 25. 2. Par. 22, 3. and 25, 16.20 1. Esd.
4, 5 Hest. 5, 10. Dan. 6, 5. 1. Mac. 1.12. 2. Match. 1, 11. and 4, 32. Act. 14,
18.
DEMETRIUS, who with other Artificers for the tendering of his own lucre and
gain, filled in a manner the whole city of the EPHESIANS with a great tumulte
and sedition against S. PAVL and his doctrine. Herin also did offend that
infamous Mar. 6, 24 Mat. 14, 8.
HERODIAS King HEROD'S aduoutres. For her dancing daughter by her counsel and
persuasion, did wickedly obtain, the bodiles head of the glorious S. IHON
Baptist which she cruelly before had requested.

4 When is commanding an alien sin? 1. Reg. 22, 17. Judith 2, 5. Hest. 3, 12
Dan. 3, 5. and 6, 16.1. Match. 1, 43. 2. Match. 6, 1. Mar. 6, 27. Act. 23, 2.


When by our decree, commission, or commandment, any wrong does redound to
our neighbor, or any evil whatsoever is committed. In this manner DAVID the
King killed innocent VRIAS, 2. Reg. 11 15.
not certes with his own or with his servants hands; but working it and
charging it by letter that he should be slain in the battle. And PILATE the
President Io. 19, 16 Luc. 23, 25.
was guilty of Christ's death: because for the favor of the Jews although
otherwise after a manner unwilling he adjudged him, and delivered him over by
his authority to be crucified. So did PHARAO Exodus 1, 16.
and HEROD Mat. 2, 16.
bind them selves with a monstrous crime, when they made the Tirannicall law
of murdering the Infantes of the Hebrews. But Esa. 10, 1. Mat. 15, 3. Mar. 7, 9.
woe be unto them that make unjust laws.

Leu 20, 4. Number. 16 24 26. Judith. 8 9. Hest. 14.15. Luc. 11.47
5 When does consent make us guilty of an alien sin?

When, that, which is wickedlye done by others, has, as it were our voice to
go with it, or is, at the least, in secret sort Iren. l. 4. cap. 46.
by us approved. So sinned SAVL, consentinge Act. 7, 60
to the death of the Protomartyr Saint STEVEN. Also herein offended above
forty Act. 23, 12.
men of the Jews, who by vow bound and armed themselves to put S. PAVL to
death. Finallye herein offended the Citizens of Jerusalem, Mat. 27, 20. Mar.
15, 11.
giving their voices to their Magistrates, that Christ might suffer death, so
that S. PETER for that cause, vpbraiding them, said: The author Act. 3, 15 and
2, 23.
of life you killed. Wherefore is that sentence of S. PAVL to be noted: Not To.
1, 32.
only they which do evil things, but they also which consent unto the doers,
are worthy of death.

And hereunto may be referred that which we read in S. CYPRIAN: He is ep. 51.
quae est Cleri. Romans ad. Cypr.
not free from wickedness that gave commandment to have it accomplishede: nor
he clear from crime; who notwithstanding he never committed the same, yet
geuethe his consent that it shall be otherwise given out, and publicly
registered.

6 When do we contract an alien sin by provocation?

1. Reg. 1, 6. Psalm. 105, 16 2. Match. 14, 27. Gal. 5, 15.26 Ephesians. 6, 4. Col. 3,
21.
When we do wittinglye provoke another to anger revenge, blasphemy, cruelty,
or other such like vices, whether it be done by word or deed or any other
means howsoever. As when JOBS Job. 2, 9.
wife wantonly scorning her most patient husband, did also persuade him so much
as lay in her, to blaspheme God. And Tobies wife Tob. 2, 15. and 3, 7.
as troublesome as the other often molesting and exasperating her husband with
her reproachful speeches, brought the matter to this pass, that the afflicted
man was constrained to bewail his domestical injury with sighs, and tears,
and prayers unto Almighty God. But Ecclesiasticus admonishes the contrary,
saying: Keep Eccli. 28, 10. Pro. 15, 18. and 18, 6. and 22, 10. et 26, 17. and
29, 22. and 30, 33.
thy self from contention, and thou shall diminishe sins. For an angry man
does kindle contention, and a man a sinner will molest his friends, and in the
midst of them that are in peace, sows enmity. And so has Solomon said:
An evil man Pro. 17, 11. and 3, 30. Esa. 33, 1.
always seeks chidings, but the cruel Angel shall be sent against him.

7 When are we spotted with an alien sin, by praise or flattery? Pro. 24,
24.28. and 27, 2.5.6. and 28, 23 Psalm. 140, 5. Esa. 5, 20. Chrysostom. ho 2. de
David. et Saul. Cyp. de laps. Basil ho^. in Psalm. 61. Aug. in Psa. 134.


When we commend any man in misdeeds or lewd behavior, or as though the thing
were very well done, we give a spur to him that runs amiss, that he may
hold on his wicked course. But woe be unto them EZech. 13, 18.
that sow coushens, under every elbow, and do make pillowes under the head
of every age to take souls, as the Prophet says. And into this vice do
preachers Hier. 14, 13. and 23, 15 17. and 27, 9 and 28, 15. and 29.8. Thren.
1, 14 Mich. 3, 5. 3. Reg. 22, 6
sometime fall, and Magistrates naughtely flattering the common people, whilst
they do openly favor and approve their licentiousness. And therefore rightly
says ESAIE: O my people, Esa 3, 12 and 9, 15. and 30, 10
they that call thee happy, these are they that deceive thee, and bring to
naught the way of thy steps. For which cause S. PAVL commands us to shun
those doctors, that by sweet speeches To. 16, 18. 2. Pet 2, 1.12.14. Hiero.
l.c. aduer. Pelag c. 9. and l. 2. aduer. Iouin c. 19.
and benedictions, do seduce the hearts of innocents. For because the sinner
is Psalm 1, 24 and 54, 22. Pro. 1, 10 and 16, 29. and 17 15. and 29, 5. Eccle 7,
6. Hier. 9, 3.8.
praised in the desires of his soul, and the wicked man is accounted happy:
the sinner will provoke our Lord, as the Kingly Prophet testifies.

8 When does an alien sin fall upon us through our silence?

Bern. de not. Joan. Bapt. Greg. 2. part past. c. 4. Aug. ep. 109 et ho. 7. ex
50 Prosp. lib. l. de vit. cont. cap. 20. Isid. de sum. bon. l. 3. c. 44 45.46.
When our unseasonable silence brings detriment to our subject, or to any
other person. For example sake, if by office it belong unto us to teach,
admonish, or correct our brother, or the wholle people, and we omit the
same without just cause, when we may do good. For which cause our Lord by
ESAIE, testifies to every one that preaches: Cry, Esa. 58, 1. Hier. 23, 22.
and 26, 2. and 50, 2. Ionae. 1, 2. 1. Cor. 9, 16.
do not cease, as a trumpette exalte thy voice, and show unto my people their
wickedness, and to the house of Jacob their sins. Hear moreover the danger
they stand in, who are not without cause called dumme dogs, Esa. 56, 10.
not able to bark: If Ezech. 3, 17. and 33, 7. and ibid. Hier. Greg. ho. 11.
in Ezech. Act. 20, 18. Esa. 6, 5. Hest. 4, 13.
when I say to a wicked man, (says our Lord) thou shall die the death, thou
do not warn him, and speak to him, that he may forsake his wicked way, and
live; the wicked man himself shall die in his iniquity, but I will require
his blood at thy hand. So necessary a thing it is to be observed, which S.
PAVL not without great protestation does require. Preach the word; 2. Tim. 4,
2. Tit. 1, 9.13. and 2, 15. Chrysostom. ho. 6. in epist. ad Phil.
urge in season, out of season, reprove, beseech, rebuke in all patience and
doctrine: and again in an other place: Them that sin 1. Tim. 5, 20. Leu. 19,
17. Aug. sermon. 15. cap. 7. de verb. Dom. and sermon. 16. cap. 4, 7.8.
reprove before all: that the rest also may have fear.

9 When are we by winking or indulgence entangled with alien sins?

SO often, as that thing which by our power or authority, may and ought to be
amended, and punished; we notwithstanding, suffer to go unpunished, and to wax
worse and worse.

Herein do Magistrates offend, when they bear the sword To. 13, 4. Sap. 6,
3. Psalm. 2, 10. Aug. 2. retr. c. 5. and ep. 48.50.204. tract 11. in Euang Joan.
Bern. ser. 66. in Cant.
in vain, and are not as they are called, Gods ministers, and reuengers unto
wrath, to those that behave them selves wickedly or seditiously. This was the
sin 1. Reg. 15, 9. Iud. 20, 13. Nu^. 25, 4
of King SAVL, when contrary to the commandment of God, he spared his enemies
the Amalechites. The same sin was also incurred by King ACHAB, when he
received into favor BENADAB the King of Syria: for which cause he did not
escape the severe sentence of the Prophet giving this threate: This says 3.
Reg. 20, 42.
our Lord, because thou have dismissed out of thy hand a man worthy of death,
thy life shall be for his life, and thy people for his people. Heereunto may be
referred that which the Apostle wills the Corinthians: Take 1. Cor. 5, 6.13.
Exodus 22, 18 Deuteronomy. 13, 1.6.12. and 17, 12. and 18, 20 3. Reg. 18, 19.40. Hier.
in cap. 5. ad Gal. Greg. lib. 32. ep. 31.
away the evil from among your selves: Know you not that a little leaven
corrupts the wholle paste? purge the old leaven.

Secondly herein do Aug. in Psalm. 50. Greg. 4. dial. c. 18. Chrysostom. ho. 9. in
1. ad Tim. Ephesians. 6, 4. Heb. 12, 7. Pro. 13, 18.24. and 22, 15.6. and 23, 13.
and 29, 15 17.21. Eccli. 7, 25. et 22, 3.4.5. and 30, 1.
fathers and mothers, masters and maistreses offend, whilst they with a
certain dissembling and favorable indulgence, do mar those in bringing
them up that are committed to their charge, and by their negligence and sloth
do suffer them to fall into great hazard and danger. So we read the sons
of HELI, 1. Reg. 3, 11. and 4, 17. 3. Reg. 1, 6.
to have bin depraved through the default only of their fathers indulge^ce who
for that cause, was grievously punished for his too much lenity.

Heereunto may also be added that sin which is commonly called the omission
of brotherly correction, Pro. 9, 7. and 15, 5.10.12. and 24, 14 15. and 25, 12.
and 27, 5.6. and 28, 23. and 29, 1. Eccles. 7, 6. Eccli. 7, 25. and 10, 28 and
11, 7. and 19, 13.17. and 20, 1.4. Psalm. 140, 5. Col. 1, 28. 1. These. 5, 14 2.
These. 3, 15 1. Tim. 5, 20 2 Timothy 2, 25 and 4, 2. Tit. 1, 9.10. and 2, 15.
admonition, or reprehension. For as much as Christ has warned us to correct
our brother, once, and twice, and the third time that we may win Mat. 18, 15.
him when he sins. Although some do distinguish between this manner of
omission and the former sufferance which we spoke of, making them two
different kinds of alien sins.

10 How do we contract an alien sin by participation?

Tob. 2, 21. Pro. 1, 14. and 29, 24. Number. 16, 26 Eccli. 5, 1. 2 Par. 20, 36
Greg. Turo^. in glo. Conf. c. 36. and 71. Et lib. 1. de glor. Mart. c. 38.72.
and 79. and lib. 2. cap. 13.14.15.16 17. and 20. Theod. li. 3. hist. c. 11. and
12. Vict. l. 1. persecu. Ios. 7, 24. Dan. 5, 23. 2. Match. 3, 24. and 5, 15. and
9, 5. 1. Match. 6, 12.
THen espeacially, when we are partners in gain with thieves and extortioners:
also when we do wittingly together with others, challenge or retain goods
unjustly gotten or which any way do belong to other men: and then moreover
when we are enriched with the spoil of others. And heereunto seems to belong
that which the Psalmist says, to run with the very thieves Ps. 49, 18. Aug.
in Psalm. 129.
themselves, and to have portion with the aduoutrers. This did ESAIE object
unto the people of the Jews Thy Esa. 1, 23.
Princes be unfaithful, companions of thieves, all do love gifts, and follow
rewards. And yet more grievously do they sin, who do manifestly make a gain
unto themselves of an other man's filthiness, Deuteronomy. 23, 18.
as bauds do: or such as dare give lodgeing and harbor unto thieves, or
notorious dishonest and factious persons, where they may have cover for
themselves, or for their things.

11 When do we by defending commit an alien sin?

When we either protect malefactors, or defend and publishe an other man's
doctrine, though it be perverse and wicked. When also by our care and endeavor,
we labor to further and maintain that, which is appointed against equity and
Justice. Against such persons there thundreth out this divine oracle: Woe Esa.
5, 20. and 10, 1.
unto you that call evil good; and good, evil: making darkness, light; and
light, darkness: making bitter, sweet; and sweet, bitter: And again: Thou
Exodus 23, 2.
shall not follow the multitude to do evil: neither shall thou in judgment
yield to the sentence of many; so, to decline from the truth.

And this shall suffice touching Alien sins as they call the^, which now
certes in those days do reach very far, and are over licentiously committed
every day, espeacially by Magistrates. And there is commonly so little heed
taken of them; that most men do think them not to be sins at all: nor make
any accounte of the^: although often times with the filthe of these sins,
they defile and make guilty of perpetual torments, both their own and other
men's consciences. And al these kinds mentioned before, may be reduced to three
kinds, and in few words comprehended, as shows S. BASIL. Bas. ser. 2. de
Bap. ca. 9.
For that we fall into the participation of an other man's error, or sin: it
comes to pass, either by Deed and Act: or by Will only, and a certain
purpose of the mind: or by some careless negligence, if at any time others
be defrauded of the duty that we owe in admonishing them, and seeking their
amendment.

But the worste kind of sinning of all others without comparison, is when a
man sins against the Holy Ghost.

OF SINS AGAINST THE HOLY GHOST.
1 What is a sin against the Holy Ghost?

Vide S. Tho mam. in 2.2. quaest. 14.
IT is maliciously, and contemptuously to reiecte the grace and liberality of
God being offered, which grace certes, is peculiarly attributed to the
Holy Ghost, as to the fountain of all goodness. And this is to sin without
any remedy or redress: insomuch that according to the speech of Christ, for
such and so great a sin, no forgiveness is obtained either Mat. 12, 31. Mar.
3, 28. Luc. 12, 10.
in this world, or in the world to come. For after this manner Almighty God
deals with us, that he gives neither grace upon earth, nor glory in Heaven
to any other, but unto those only which having once known sin, do detest
it; and setting before their eyes that which is good, do make choice of a
righteous course of life. But from these sins far is banished both
detestation of sin, and the choice also of that good which were to be
followed; and that moreover is clean rejected, whereby the Holy Ghost does use
of his singular grace to withdraw a man from sin. And for this reason, they
which are fettered with such kind of sins, do either never get the grace of
God: or seldom and very hardly. For these sins are not committed of humane
imbecillitie and frailty; which were to sin against the Father, and the
might and power of the Father: as we see in S. PETER Mat. 26, 74. Vide Greg.
lib. 25. Mor. cap. 16.
the Apostle who denied Christ: nor yet of ignorance; which were to sin
against the Son, and the wisdom of the Son: as was SAVL 1. Tim. 1, 13. Act
9, 1.
his case, when he persecuted the Church: but that which is far worse without
comparison, these sins are committed of malice and obstinacy of mind: as we
see for example in those most perverse and obstinate Pharisees.

2 How many sins are there against the holy Ghost?

THere are of that kind accounted six, and their names commonly used, are
these. Presumption of the mercy of God, or of the impunitie of sin;
Desperation; Oppugning of the known truth; Envying of brotherly charity;
Obstinacy; and impenitencie. But more plainly and significantly they may be
thus numbered.

1 Confidently to abuse the mercy of God.

2 Utterly to despair of the grace of God, or of his own salvation.

3 Rebelliouslye, to oppugn the truth of religion against his own conscience.

4 Vehemently to be moved with a settled Envy, because of the increase of
salvation and virtue in his brother.

5 With an obstinate mind to persiste wittingly in a fault.

6 Without purpose of ame^dment, never to make an end of a lewd and perverse
kind of life.

3 What manner of presumption makes a sin against the holy Ghost? Greg. in
c. 3. lib. 1. reg. and l 33. mor. c. 15. and l. 6. ep. 22. Fulg. de fid. ad
Pet. cap. 3. Bern. sermon. 38. ex paruis.


THat, which makes a man to trust only in the mercy of God, and to be
hardened and emboldened to sin: all manner of respect, of Gods Justice and
fear being laid aside. And thus certes do very many sin at this day, who
flattering themselves with an only faith Aug. de. fid. and op. c. 14. and 22.
in Ench. ca. 67. and haer. 54. Hier. in c. 4. Osc.
in Christ, do like beasts Joel. 1, 17
wallow and rotte in the midst of the filth of sins; and not to themselves
only, but to others also dare promise 2. Pet. 2, 18 Eccles. 8, 14. Conc. Trid.
sess. 6. cap. 9. and can. 12.13.14. Hier. in cap. 4. Dan.
security: if only they have confidence in the merits of Christ, and in the
grace of God apprehended by faith; although in the mean time the fruits Luc.
3, 8.9. and 13, 3. Mat. 3, 8.10. Act. 26, 20. Eccli. 2, 22.
of penance be nothing regarded. But to all these does the doctor of the
Gentiles cry out: Do thou contemn, says he, the riches of the goodness of
God, and patience, To. 2, 4. Eccles. 8, 11. Eccli. 15, 21. Aug. trac. 33 in
Joan. and ho. 50. ex 50. ca 4. Isid. de sum. bo. lib. 2. cap. 13.
and longanimitie, not knowing that the benignity of God brings thee to
penance. And for that cause, he in an other place is so far 1. Cor. 13, 1
off from willing men to vaunt of only faith; that he bids even the
faithful themselves every one, to work their salvation with fear and Phil.
2, 12 Psalm. 2, 11. Pro. 28, 14. Romans 11, 20 1. Cor. 4, 4. and 10, 12.
trembling: commending unto them a faith not dead and idle, as Saint Iac. 2,
14.
JAMES calls it; but lively and effectual, which works duly by Gal. 5, 6.
charity. Against this abominable sin thus exclameth the Ecclesiasticus: Of
Eccli. 5, 4.5. Eccle. 9, 1. vide Aug de perf. lust cap 15. and de corr. and
gra. c. 13. and ho. 41. ex 50. and ser. 3. de Innoc. Greg. li. 16. mor. c. 3.
the remission of sin be thou not without fear, neither do thou add sin,
upon sin. And do not say: the mercy of our Lord is great he will have
compassion upon the multitude of my sins. For mercy and anger do soon
approach from him, and his anger does look upon sinners. rightly therefore
says the Prophet: I will sing mercy Ps. 100, 1. Bern. ser 52. ex paruis. and
ser. 6. in Ca^t. Aug. de vtil. poenit. c. ult.
and judgment unto thee, o Lord. then in an other place: The Ps. 98, 4
honor of the King loves judgment.

4 How does a man sin against the holy Ghost by desperation?

When the contrary vice unto presumption, Aug. ser. 58. de temp. and in Psalm.
50. Greg. lib. 5. mor. c. 14. Isid. lib. 2. de sum. bo. c. 14 Chry. ho. 2. in
Psalm. 50. Ber. ser. 5. de not. Dom.
whereof we spoke before, does so possess the mind of a man, that he casts
off all hope, either of obtaining pardone before God, or of attaining unto life
everlasting.

After this sort sinned CAIN, by despair, as himself testifies by his
speech, when he says: Genesis 4, 13 Bern. ser. 11. in Cant.
Greater is my iniquity, than that I may deserve pardon. Thus sinned also IVDAS
that Traitor Mat. 27, 3. Act. 1, 18. Ephesians. 4, 19. 2. Reg. 2, 26.
unto Christ, at what time he being moved with despair of salvation, like an
unhappy wretch, hanged himself. But doubtless, Ezec. 18, 21.27. and 33, 11.
1. Io. 1, 7.9. and 2, 1. Hier. 3, 1. Esa. 1, 18. Ps. 144, 8. Eccli. 17, 20.27.
there is no penance too late, as is manifest by the Luc. 23, 40. Aug. li. 1.
retr. c. 19. and de cor. and gr. ca. 15. and ser. 181. de te^p. c. 16. Leo. ep.
91. ad Theo. Conc. Trid. ses. 14. cap. 7.
example of that thief, which upon the Cross, even in those last momentes of
his life, obtained great grace and heavenly glory at the hands of Christ.

5 When does he that oppugneth the truth, sin against the Holy Ghost?

When, Leo. ep. 10. ad Flau. c. 1. Aug. de Ge^. ad lit. l. 7. c. 9 and tra.
18. in Euang. Ioa. and de vtil. cre ca. 1. and l. 18. ciu. ca. 51. and lib. 21.
c. 25.
that truth which concerns the estate of Faith and Religion, not of
ignorance but of malice, is purposely impugned, that thereby the sincerity of
Catholic verity, may be blemished. Of this sin were the Pharisees Mat. 12,
24. and 15, 2. and 21, 45. and 22, 15. Io. 7, 48. and 12, 10.19.
guilty, whose chiefest care we see to have been, as maliciously as falsely to
blaspheme Christ, to persecute the doctrine of the Gospel, and to suppress
the testimony Act. 4, 16. and 5, 18.
of the Apostles, and that even against their own consciences. Not unlike unto
these are they, that are said by the Prophet to sit in the Psalm. 1, 1.
chair of pestilence: and are called by S. PETER 2. Pet. 2, 1
lying masters that do bring in Sects of perdition: Finally by S. Tit. 3, 10.
PAVL, Heretics, men corrupted 2. Tim. 3, 8.
in mind, reprobate concerning the faith, attending 1. Tim. 4, 1.
to spirits of error, subverted and condemned by their own Tit. 3, 11
judgment. Among whom may be numbered that same seducer ELIMAS, whom S. PAVL
publikelie reprehending, said with great vehemency: O full Act. 13, 10.
of all guile and all deceipte, son of the devil, enemy of all justice,
thou ceasest not to subuerte the right ways of our Lord.

To this kind also is referred, Blasphemy Mat. 12, 31
of the Spirit: which sin Christ does greatly rebuke in the Jews, and
makes it worse then other sins. And would to God that this sin did not
reign in these our days. For against the holy Ghost do they also blaspheme,
(as writes DAMASVS) Apud Gratianum. 25. quaest. 1. violatores.
who against the holy Canons of the Fathers, endited by the instinct of the
holy Ghost, do any thing willingly or malepertly, or presume to speak, or
wilfully give their consent to the^ that have a mind so to do:. For it is
manifest that such a presumption, is one kind of the blasphemies against the
holy Ghost: thus says DAMASVS.

6 How is Envy of brotherly grace a sin against the holy Ghost? Aug. li. 1.
de ser. Dom. in monte. cap. 22. and 1. retr. cap 19.


When we are stricken with a great grief and sorrow because of the splendour
and increase of virtues, and Gods guiftes, in which our brother does excel.

Which sin seems to be rather proper unto the Devil than unto man: whereas
the Devil does most wrathfully take the increase and continuance of Sap. 2, 24
the grace of God in man: and for that cause he is not only an accuser Apoc.
12, 10.
of our brethren, but also an implacable adversary 1. Pet. 5, 8.
of God and of all good men, who as a roaring Lion goes about seeking whom he
may devour. There were among the Jews such sons of Satan, who did
altogether envy unto the Gentiles the lately springing grace of the Gospel,
as we read in the Acts Act. 11, 2. and 13, 45. Genesis 4, 5.
of the Apostles.

7 What kind of obstinacy is that which is a sin against the holy Ghost?

Aug. in Enc. cap. 83. and in Ps. 58. conc. 1. Greg. ho. 11. in Ezech. Bern.
li. 1. de consid. ca. 2. and in ser. de conuers. ad Cler. cap. 4.
THat certes which bears an obstinate mind against him that gives him good
admonition, so that he will not suffer him self by any means to be withdrawn
from his damnable course.

With this sin was King PHARAO Exodus 7, and seq. Aug. quaest. 18. and 24. in
Exodus and ser. 88. de temp. Gerg. 31. mor. c. 11 and l. 11. ca. 5.
notably attainted, who although he were so often admonished by MOSES, and
sometimes afflicted with very sore scourges from God: yet notwithstanding in
his tirannicall purpose, he Exodus 14.
obstinatly persisted, and perished. Famous also was that Hier. 5, 3. and 8, 5.
Esa. 48, 4. Zach. 7, 11. Genesis 49, 7.
incorrigible obstinacy of the Jews, whom S. STEVEN painting out as it were
in their colors, says: With a Act. 7, 51.
hardnecke and with uncircumcised ears you have all ways resisted the holy
Ghost. And not unlike unto them, are those at this day, that being addicted
unto new sects, may not abide so much as to hear or read any Catholic
instructions: but, even like to the serpent Psalm. 57, 5
called the (Aspe) shutting their ears against the sweet melody of the
sound doctrine of the Church; they seem to say: Depart thou Job. 21, 14.
from us: and, we will not have the knowledge of thy ways. which is nothing
else then as S. PAVL speaks: According To. 2, 4.
to their hardness and impenitent heart, to heap to themselves wrath, in the
day of wrath, and of the revelation of the just judgment of God. For as
SOLOMON also teaches; To a man, Pro. 29, 1. Bern. ser. 42. in Cant.
that with a hard neck contemns him that corrects him, a soddaine
destruction shall come upon him, and health shall not follow him.

8 When is a sin of impenitency committed?

Aug. de verb Do. ser. 21. cap. 12. and 13. and ep. 50. ad Bonif. Gelas. in
tomo. de anarhematis vinculo.
When a man without any end or measure of his sins, which truly he should
wash away by wholesome Penance: resolves moreover that never he will do any
Penance at al. Of this kind of persons, who are such desperate and pitiful
sinners and so will remain; both their life and their death is most Psalm. 33,
22.
abominable: for as much as, if not in words, yet in deed they seem to say:
Esa, 28, 15. and 3, 8.9. Psalm. 51, 3.7. Pro. 2, 14.
We have entered into league with death, and with hell we have made a pact.
And of these also may that saying be understood which S. JOHN avouches.
There 1. Io. 5, 16 Aug. de corr and gra. c. 12. and 1. retract. cap. 19.
is a sin to death, for that I say not that any man ask.

Thus much concerning the sins against the Holy Ghost: which are doubtless
most grievous, and which Almighty God either never, or very hardly does
pardon. For which cause, we ought often to guard our selves, and to confirm
others against the same: that we may observe that saying: Ephesians. 4, 30.
Co^tristate not, 1 Thessalonians. 5, 19.
extinguishe not the spirit of God; This Ps. 94, 8.
day if you hear his voice, harden not your hearts. Let Heb. 3, 13.
none of you be obdurate with the fallacy of sin. For Eccli. 3, 7.27.
an hard heart shall be in evil case at the last. Now therefore let us come
to those sins which are also not a little heinous, and are wont to be called
sins that cry unto Heaven.

OF SINS THAT CRY UNTO HEAVEN.
1 What sins are those that are said to cry unto Heaven?

THose, Aug. in En. c 30. and l. ann. in Job. c. 30. and l. 1. locutionis de
Genes. and quaest. 5. super Exodus Greg. 3. par. past. adm. 32. and in 2. Psalm.
poenit.
which notably above others, are known to have a manifest and exceeding
wickedness, and do singularly purchase to those which commit the^ Gods
indignation and vengeance. Of this sort there are four nu^bred in holy
scripture, to wit wilful Ge^. 4, 10.
Murder; Ge^. 18, 20
Sodomie; Ex. 22, 23
Oppression of the Poor; and defrauding Deuteronomy. 24, 15. Iac. 5, 4.
the Laboring man's hiere.

2 How does the Scripture teach that wilful murder is revenged?

IN most grievous manner doubtless, Vide Conc. Ancyr. c. 22. and Conc. Epaun.
ca. 31. Tribur. c. 54 and sequ.
as Almighty God shows in these words, wherein he rebukes CAIN the first
man-flear: Ge^. 4, 10. Amb. l. 2. de Cain. and Abel. cap. 9.
What have thou done? says he, the voice of the blood of thy brother cries
to me from the earth. Now therefore shall thou be cursed upon earth. And in
another place Gods own voice does testify. Genesis 9, 6. Ex. 21, 12.14 Leuit.
24, 17 Number. 35.16.20. Deuteronomy. 19, 11 1. Io. 3, 15.
Whosoever shall shed man's blood, his blood shall be shed also. For to the
image of God was man made. The kingly Psalmist sings: Men Ps. 54, 24.
of blood shall not live half their days. For this is a very heinous
wickedness, and he does a most horrible injury to his neighbor, that
bereueth him of his life without lawful Aug. l. 22 contr. Faust. cap. 70.
authority. For which cause, Christ himself says also. Mat. 26, 52. Apoc.
13, 10.
All that take the sword, shall perish with the sword.

3 And what is extant in holy scripture touching the sin of Sodom and the
punishments thereof?

THe men of Sodom, says the scripture, Genesis 13, 13.
were very naught, and sinners before God too too much: This horrible and
abominable sin 2. Pet. 2, 6.
S. PETER, and S. PAVL Romans 1, 24. 1. Tim. 1, 10 Ephesians. 5, 5. Iudic. 19, 22 and
20, 46.
do reprove: yea nature her self does abhor: and the scripture also does
declare the greatness of so foul a wickedness, in these words: The cry Genesis
18, 20.
of the Sodomites, and the Gomorians, is multiplied, and their sin is
aggrauated too too much. For which cause the Angels do speak thus unto the
just man LOATH, who did greatly abhor from the outrageous filthiness 2. Pet. 2,
6
of the Sodomites: Ge^. 19, 13
We will destroy this place, because the cry of them has increased before our
Lord, who has sent us to destroy them. Therefore our Lord Ibid. and Sap. 10,
6. Deuteronomy. 29, 23 Iudae. ver. 7. Genesis 13, 10. vide Greg. li. 14. mor. c. 10 Aug.
l. 16. de ciu. cap. 30. Tert. in apo. aduers gentes. ca. 40. and in Sod. ca. 4.
rained down upon Sodom and Gomorrha brimstone and fire, from our Lord out
of heaven, and ouerthrewe those Cities, and all the Country about. Neither
does the scripture leave untouched the causes which moved the Sodomites, and
may also move others to this so grievous a sin. For thus we read in EZECHIEL:
Ezec. 16, 49.
Behold this was the iniquity of Sodom thy sister: Pride, fulness of bread,
and abundance, and the idleness of her and her daughters: and they did not
stretch their hand to the needy and poor.

And of this vice which can never be sufficiently detested, are they guilty
who do not fear to break the law of God, yea and the law of nature written
in Leuiticus: which is this: Leuit. 18, 22. Deuteronomy. 27, 21 vide Chrysostom. ho. 4. in
ep. ad Romans Tert. in l. de pudicit. c. 4. Aug. lib. 3. conf. cap. 8. and ep.
109.
Cum masculo non commiscearis coitu foemineo, quia abominatio est. Cum omni
pecore non coibis, nec maculaberis cumeo. Which sin if it be committed, we are
admonished Leuit. 20, 13.15. Exo. 22, 19. Joel. 3, 3.
in the same place, that the very earth is polluted with such horrible and
abominable lusts, and that Gods wrath is very much provoked against the
people, and L. Cum vir nubit. C. ad lege^ Iul. de adult.
that the crime is to be punished with death. For which cause S. PAVL does not
once only rebuke the liers 1. Cor. 6, 9. Romans 1, 24. 1. Tim 1, 10 Gal. 5, 10.11
with mankind: And he condemns also unclean and effeminate persons. of
which one was Onan Genesis 38, 9. Hier in cap. 5. epist. ad Ephesians.
son of Judas who could not escape the present revenge of God, for that he
sinned against his own body, and worse then any beast would violate the
honesty and order of nature.

4 What does the scripture propose touching the oppression of the poor?

Thou shall not make sad the stranger, says our Lord, neither shall thou Exodus
22, 21. Deuteronomy. 15, 9. and 24, 10. Eccli. 35, 16. Hier. 21, 12. and 22, 3. Mal.
3, 5. 2. Reg. 12, 1.
afflict him: for you your selves were strangers in the land of Egypt. Ye
shall not hurt the widow and the fatherless: If you do hurt them; they
will cry out unto me, and I will hear their cry; and my fury shall take
indignation, and I will strike you with the sword, and your wives shall be
widows and your children Orphans.

For which cause the Egiptians were Exodus 7. and sequent.
scourged with so many plagues, and with their most cruel King and Tirant
PHARAO, who spared not to kill the very Infants Exodus 1, 8
of the Hebrews; were finally Ex. 14, 27
drowned: because of their cruelty, more then barbarous, against the
Israelites. I have seen, says our Lord, the affliction Exodus 3, 7
of my people in Egypt, and I have heard their cry, because of the hardness of
those that are overseers of the works: and knowing their grief, I came down
to deliver them out of the hands of the Egiptians. For this cause does our
Lord threaten by ESAIE the Prophet: Woe Esa. 10, 1 Deuteronomy. 27, 19 Job. 24, 1.
Mat. 23, 14.
they that make unjust laws: and writing, have written injustice: that they
might oppress the poor in judgment, and do violence to the cause of the
humble of my people: that widows might be their pray, and that they might
spoil the fatherless. And in the same Prophet there is extant this complaint
of cruel and unjust Magistrates: Thy Princes Esa. 1, 23. Hier. 5, 28. Zach. 7,
9. Psalm. 93, 3. Amos. 5, 11.
are Infidels, companions of thieves: all do love bribes: they follow after
rewards. They do not give judgment to the fatherless, and the cause of the
widdowe does not enter in unto them. Again: their Esa. 3, 12.14.
Collectours have spoiled my people. And there is no doubt, but that Cities and
Provinces by reason of this abominable sin, which is committed by tirannicall
Magistrates, are oftentimes brought into extreme danger.

5 What finally does the scripture teach, concerning the withholding or
diminishing of the laborers wages?

WE read in the Apostle S. JAMES how vehemently he does vpbraide rich men
with their cruel sparing, and egregious wickedness in defrauding poor
laborers. Iac. 5, 4.
Behold the hiere of the workmen that have reaped your feeldes, which is
defrauded by you, cries: And their cry has entered into the ears of the
Lord of Sabbath. And Eccli. 34, 25, and 7, 22.
Ecclesiasticus writes in this manner: The bread of the needy, is the life of
the poor man: he that defraudeth him is a man of blood. He that takes away
the bread in sweat, as he that kills his neighbor. He that sheddeth blood
and he that defraudeth the hired man, are brethren.

Therefore it is decreed by the law of God: Thou shall not deny the Deuteronomy. 24,
14. Leuit. 19, 13 Tob. 4, 15. Mal. 3, 5.
hiere of thy poor and needy brother, or of the stranger, that abides with
thee in the land, and is within thy gates: but the very same day, thou shall
render to him the price of his labor before the sunsette, because he is poor,
and thereby he sustaineth his life: least he cry against thee to our Lord, and
it be reputed to thee for a sin.

6 To what end is all this discourse of sins to be referred, and what is the
use and commodity thereof?

THis discourse belongs to the first part of Christian Justice, which
consists in knowing and fleeing of evils: And the use and commodity thereof,
is, rightlye to discern, and being discerned, utterly to eschew those things
which are verily euels, contrary to God, pernicious unto men: and if in case
any of them be committed; then diligently to endeavor to purge the same.

Hereby we learn also how a wise man differs from a fool, and a just man
from a wicked person. For a wise man Pro. 14, 16.
fears, and declineth from evil: but a fool leapeth over and is confident.
For Pro. 18, 2
a fool does not receive the words of wisdom, except thou speak those
things, which his heart is set upon, as witness the SOLOMON: who also
writes thus: The paths of just Pro. 4, 18
persons as a bright shining light proceeds and increases even unto a
perfect day: the way of the wicked is dark and obscure, they know not where
they fall. Many certes are Aug. de gra. and lib. arb. cap. 3. and lib 3. de
lib. arb. cap. 22. Bern. epi. 77. ad Hugon. Chrysostom. hom. 26. in epist. ad Romans
shamefully ignorant of those pernicious plagues of the mind, the sins that
we have declared: others although they know them never so well; yet do they
not avoid and detest them. But worst of all are others who are obdurate See
before of obstinacy. and Aug. in Enc. cap. 80.
with the custom of sin: of which kind, it is thus said: A wicked Pro. 18, 3
man when he is come into the bottom of sins, contemns; but shame and
reproach does follow him. And this kind of men does contemn those things
espeaciallye, which Christian Justice does require, not only for the marking
and discerning of vices, but also for the necessary avoiding and purging of the
same.

OF THE PVRGING OF SINS. Conc. Trid. sess. 5. can. 3. and ses. 6. cap. 2. and
7.

1 And by what means are sins purged?

Here, first of all, it is out of controversy, that Christ is unto us a To.
3, 24. 1. Io. 2, 1. and 4, 10. and 1, 7.
propitiatour, and that Lamb Io. 1, 36. Mat. 1, 21. 1. Cor. 1, 30. 1. Tim. 2,
5. Heb. 1, 3. and 9, 12. Act. 4, 12.
of God that takes away the sins of the world, who only could deserve for
us remission of sins, and make purgation of the same.

Then is it most certain, that God does purify men's hearts by Faith, as
Act. 15, 9. Heb. 11, 1.6. Gal. 2, 16. and 3, 8. Romans 3, 24. Luc. 7, 50. Ephesians.
2, 8. Trid. sess. 6. cap. 8.
S. PETER says, because that without Faith (which is the door and foundation
of man's salvation) none can obtain, or hope for remission, or purging of their
sins. And as touching Faith, they are utterly destitute Aug. tra. 67. in
Joan. Leo. ser. 4. de Not. Dom.
thereof, who not consenting with the Faith of the Church, do with a certain
vain See before of presumption. page 315.
confidence promise unto themselves, and others, remission of sins, and grace
of Justification through Christ.

But they that perseuering in the Faith and unity of the Church, do desire to
be delivered from their sins: have many ways proposed unto them in
Scripture for the taking away of their Orig. ho. 2. in Leuit. Aug. l. 2. co^t.
Cres. cap. 12. Chry. Conc. 4. de Lazar. in finc. and ho. 6. in Io.
sins, amongst which, the principal is the Sacrament of Penance. Which
being despised, it is to no purpose to use any See before of the Sacrament of
Penance. page 196.
other remedies Whose Io. 20, 22
sins you shall remit, they are remitted them.

Secondly, sins are cleansed and purged by Alms: because it is written:
Alms Tob. 4, 8. and 12, 8. Eccli. 3, 15.33 Pro. 13, 8. and 15, 27. and 16, 6.
Luc. 11, 41.
delivers from all sin and from death; and will not suffer a soul to go
into darkness. Therefore the Prophet gives this admonition: Da^. 4, 24 Esa.
1, 17.18. Heb. 13, 16. See after of Alms.
Redeem thy sins with Alms, and thy iniquities with the mercies of the
poor.

If Mat. 6, 14. Luc. 6, 37. Mar. 11, 25. Eccli. 28, 2.
you will forgive men their offenses, your heavenly Father will forgive you
also your offenses.

He Iac. 5, 20
which makes a sinner to be converted from the error of his way, shall save
his soul from death, and covers a multitude of sins.

Many Luc. 7, 47
sins are forgiven her, because she loved much. For Pro. 10, 12. 1. Pet. 4,
8.
Charity covers the multitude of sins.

Sixthly, hereunto is available the Ps. 50, 19. Luc. 18, 13. Mat. 18, 32.
Eccli. 21, 1.
heart, which God never despises, and an humble knowledge of a man's self, and
confession of his sins. For our Lord has respect Psalm. 101, 18.
upon the prayer of the humble, and does not despise their petitions: In so much
that hereupon holy DAVID also testifies of him self; Psalm. 31, 5.
I have said: I will confess against my self my injustice unto our Lord,
and thou have remitted the impiety of my sin. And S. IHON generally to all that do truly confess promises this grace: 1. Io. 1, 9.
If we confess our sins says he, he is faithful and just for to forgive us
our sins, and to cleanse us from all iniquity. Therefore the Ninevites Ionae.
3, 5 Mat. 12, 41. Luc. 11, 32. 3. Reg. 21, 29. Sap. 11, 24. Cypr. ep. 40.8.26.
when they did earnestlye persevere in works of humility and Penance; appeased
the present wrath of God, and turned away the imminent destruction of their
City and country. And therefore of them we read it thus written: God Ione.
5, 10. Number. 25, 11 Psalm. 105, 30.
saw their works, because they were turned from their evil ways: and God
took compassion of the evil which he had spoken that he would do to the^,
and did it not.

Thus finally we learn by the testimony of holy Scripture, that by Pro. 10, 2
Act. 8, 22. 2. Cor. 7, 10.
these, and other means and offices of true piety done by the grace of
Christ; this effect is wrought, that the sins of faithful penitents in the
Church (as we said before) are purged and taken away: in regard whereof the
Apostle warns: Having 2. Cor. 7, 1. 2 Timothy 2, 19.21.
therefore these promises, my dearest, let us cleanse our selves from all
inquination of the flesh and spirit perfiting sanctification in the fear of
God. And with no less vehemency speaks S. JAMES Iac. 4, 8. Ezec. 18, 27.
Cleanse says he, your hands you sinners: and purify your hearts you double
of mind. Be miserable and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned into
mourning, and joy into sorrow. Be humble in the sight of our Lord, and he will
exalte you. For it is not sufficient for a man to amend his manners, and to
leave his misdedes: (that we may again use the words Hom 50 ex 50. cap. 5.
and in Ench. cap. 70. and Cypr. de lapsis in fine and others as before of
Satisfaction page 209.
of S. AUGUSTINE) Unless by the sorrow of penance, by the sighings of
humility, and by the sacrifice of a contrite heart, together with the
cooperation of alms; satisfaction he made to God, for those things also that
have been committed. Otherwise who so shall know that any mortal sins do
bear sway in him, as the same Se^* 41. de Sanctus.
Saint writes, except he worthily amend himself and (if he have space) do
penance along time, and give large alms, and refrain from the sins
themselves: he cannot be purged with that transtorie fire whereof the Apostle
1. Cor. 5, 15. Aug. lib, 16. ex 50. Ench. ca. 67. and de fid. and op. ca. 16.
and quaest. 1. ad Dulcitium.
has spoken but shall be tormented without any redress in the everlasting
flame. For not deadly sins, but little sins are purged and cleansed after
this life.

2 And what conceipte ought we to have of little sins?

Aug. Ench. cap. 78. and li. 21. ciu. 5.27. Isid. lib. 2. de sum. bo. c. 18
THis surely, that such lighter sins, as, the wandering of the mind, an idle
word, immoderate laughter, and such like, which are called quotidian, or
venial sins, and without the which this life is not past over, for in Iac.
3, 2. 1. Io. 1, 8. Eccles. 7, 21. Pro. 24, 16. Psalm. 31, 6.
many things we offend all; as we also noted before: although they are not
deadly, and do seem little in outward appara^ce; yet they are not to be Aug.
de 10. chord. c. 11. and in Pse. 129. ser. 244. de te^p. and tr. 12. in Joan.
contemned. For so much as they displease God, or (as S. PAVL speaks) they
Ephesians. 4, 30 Chry. ho. 87. in Mat. and 8. in 1. Cor. and in ser. de leuium
peccatorum periculis. Bern. ser. 1. de conuers. Pauli. et in tract. de
praecepto and dispens. c. 14.
contristate the holy Ghost, they darken and obscure the conscience, they
diminish the fervor of charity, and they do hinder the proceeding of
virtues, and draw a man often times to greater vices and dangers. For which
cause it is written: He that Eccli. 19, 1.
despises little things, shall by little and little fall. He Ibid. 3, 27.
that loves danger, shall perish in it. He Eccles. 9, 18.
that shall sin in one thing, shall lose many good things.

Therefore these blottes and filthes of the soul, as much as may be, are to
be eschewed: for as we read: Apoc. 21, 27. Psalm. 14, 2. and 23, 4.
There shall not enter into the Heavenly Jerusalem any polluted thing. And
except they be washed away in this life, they do burden a man after See above
of Satisfaction. page. 215.
his death, and cannot certes be cleansed without the bitter pains of
Purgatory fire. Which fire although it be not everlasting; yet, if we believe
In Psalm. 37. and ser. 41. de Sanctis. Greg. in 3. Ps. poenit.
Saint. AUGUSTINE, It is more sharp and grievous, than whatsoever a man can
suffer in this life.

3 What then are the remedies to purge the lighter sort of sins?

FOR the washing away of such filthes of the soul in this life; the Primitive
Church has Aug. ep. 108. Ench. c. 71. 72. in Io. tract. 12. ser. 41. de Sanct.
lib. 21. ciu. c. 27. and ho. 50 ex 50. ca. 13. Conc. Tolet. 4. can. 9.
acknowledged and used these remedies. An humble accusation of a man's self:
our Lords prayer: knocking of the Breaste: and other the like devout
exercises, either toward God, or toward our neighbor, and afflictions of
the body, voluntarily and devoutly undertaken. Which remedies, wise men
certes so much the more willingly and seriously do embrace, by how much they
do more perfectly know, and more diligently weigh and consider the severity
of Gods Justice in Job. 24, 12. Prosp. in sent Aug. c. 210. Aug. in Ps. 58
revenging of sin. Which may be expressly showed even by that one dreadful
speech of Christ: I say unto you Mat. 12, 36.
that every idle word that me^ shall speak, they shall render an account for it
in the day of judgment: Also by that speech of S. PETER: 1. Pet. 4, 18.
The just man shall scarce be saved. Insomuch that for this cause JOB a man
otherwise. Just and Innocent has said: I did Job. 9, 28.
fear all my works knowing that thou did not spare him that sins. And
the Apostle Saint PAVL: It is Heb. 10, 31.
horrible to fall into the hands of the living God: But 1. Cor. 11, 31.
if we did judge our selves (as the same Apostle warns us) we should not
be judged. Therefore, Pro. 28, 14.
Blessed is that man that is always fearful: but he that is of a hard heart
shall fall into evil.

4 Is it sufficient to abstain from sin?

CHristian Justice, Bern. ser. 34. ex paruis. Chrysostom. in Ps. 4. and ho. 16. in
ep. ad Ephesians. Aug. sermon. 59. de temp.
whereof we have hitherto treated, proposes two parts, and as equally
necessary commends them unto us, in these words: Decline Ps. 36, 27. and 33,
15. and ibid. Aug.
from evil, and do good. As also S. PAVL teaches: Hating To. 12, 9. 1. Pet.
3, 10.11. Tob. 4, 13. Esa. 1, 16. Eccli. 3, 32. Col. 3, 8. Ephesians. 4, 16.17.20.
Iac. 4, 17. Mat. 3, 10. and 7, 19.
evil and cleaueing to good. Therefore It is not sufficient, as In sent.
Prosp. c. 86. Aug. lib. 19. ciu. cap. 14.
S. AUGUSTINE has plainly said; to abstain from evil: except that be done
which is good: and it is a small matter to hurt no man, except thou do
endeavor to do good to many. Wherefore, having now finished after our manner,
the first part of Justice, which prohibiteth evils; it follows now, that by
the help of Christ we go foreward to speak of the other part also, which
consists in the pursuit of those things which are good.

OF THREE SORTS OF GOOD WORKS.
1 In what good things does Christian Justice consiste.

THis Justice extends Chrysostom. in Psa. 4. and 14. and ho. 23. in Genesis
so far, that it contains in it self all the good things which are
honestly, justly, and devoutly done; and proposes the same unto us, as to be
both desired and followed. Wherefore thus does the Apostle admonish the
faithful: Walk Col. 1.
worthy of God, in all things pleasing, fructifying in all good work:
Providing To. 12. 2. Cor. 8, 21. Mat. 5, 17. 1. Pet. 2, 12.
good things not only before God, but also before all men. For this is the
true use, and proper fruit of our vocation, and of Christian Justice purchased
by Christ, as witnesses 1. Pet. 2.
S. PETER; That being dead to sins we may live to Justice: that is to say,
as S. PAVL expounds it: That Tit. 2. vide Bern. ser. 2. de resur.
denying impiety, and worldly desires, we live soberly and justly and godly in
this world. To this effect is that of the Gospel proposed unto us: that without
Luc. 1.
fear being delivered from the hands of our enemies, we may serve him in
holiness and justice before him all our days. For therefore has Christ
redeemed us from all Tit. 2.
iniquity that he might cleanse to himself a people acceptable, a pursuer of
good works. For Ephesians. 2.
we are the work of God himself, created in Christ Jesus in good works,
which God has prepared that we should walk in them.

Thus does S. PAVL constantly write, and warn all men about the observance and
continual practice of Christian Justice. And for this cause also S. IHON does
wisely admonish and absolutely define: 1. Io. 3.
Little children let no man seduce you. He that does justice is just, even as
he also is just. He that commits sin is of the Devil. And S. JAMES
expressly teaches: By works Iac. 2. Aug. in praef. in Psa. 31. and de fid. et
op. c. 14. Chrysostom. ho. 2. in Gen
a man is justified and not by faith only. For even as the body without the
spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead. Then again the same
Apostle: He that has looked Iac. 1.
in the law of perfect liberty, and has remained in it, not made a
forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work; this man shall be blessed in his
deed. And noe other meaning then this had S. PAVL when he said: Not To. 2.
the hearers of the law are just with God, but the doers of the law shall be
just.

2 What profit do the works of Christi an Justice procure?

VEry singular certes, and manifold both in this life and in the life to come.
For hereunto belongs that speech of S. PAVL: Piety 1. Tim. 4. Pro. 11, 17,
18. 2. Par. 15, 7. Mat. 10, 41. and 19, 21.29 Genesis 12, 1. and 15, 1. Eccli. 12,
2. and 36, 18. Hier. 31, 16.
is profitable to al things, having promise of the life that now is, and of the
life to come. Then in an other place we find it written: Sap. 3, and 10.17.
Mal 3, 14. 1. Cor. 15, 58. Heb. 6, 10.
Of good labors, there is glorious fruit.

1 For first these works proceeding from a lively faith, that is, from a faith
working by Gal. 5.
charity, are not only signs of Christian vocation, but do also confirm and
make sure the same in us. And therefore S. PETER the Apostle, who in every
place exhorts to good works; has added this also: 2. Pet. 1. Cypr. ep. 57.
ad Corn. in fine.
Brethren labor the more that by good works you may make sure your vocation,
and election; for doing these things you shall not sin at any time.

2 Secondly they do 2. Cor. 9, 10. Col. 1, 10. 1. Pet. 2, 2.
augment grace in the believers and do perfitte sanctification, 2. Cor. 7, 1.
To. 6, 22. Apo. 22, 11. Eccli. 18, 22. Trid. sess. 6, cap. 10.
as witnesses the Apostle: In so much that hereupon Saint JAMES also
affirms, that faith which does work with works, is also consummate by the
same Iac. 2, 22.
works.

3 Thirdly, they engender Io. 3, 20. 1. Io. 4, 17. Iac. 2, 25. Gal. 6, 4.
a confidence of a good conscience, and do the more encourage to pray, and to
obtain any thing at Gods hand, for it is written: Alms shall be a great Tob.
4.
confidence before the high God to all them that do the same. And again: My
1. Io. 3. Io. 15, 7. Aug. in Praef in Psalm. 31.
dearest if our heart do not reprehend us, we have confidence toward God. And
whatsoever we shall ask, we shall receive of him: because we keep his
commandments, and do those things which are pleasing before him. There is an
example extant in EZECHIAS the King, who having confidence in a good
conscience, and being approved therein by Gods own voice; said: I beseech
Esa. 38. 4. Reg. 20, 3. Psalm. 7, 9. and 16, 1. and 17, 21, 25. et 25, 1. and
34, 24. and 131, 1.
thee o Lord, remember I pray thee, how I have walked before thee in truth,
and in a perfect heart; and have done that which is good in thy sight.

4 Finally they do cause, that laboring in the Mat. 20. Aug. tra. 67. in Io.
Greg. l. 4. dial. c. 35
vineyarde of Christ we may receive the day penie, (to wit) the promised
reward of life everlasting, and the crown 2. Tim. 4.8. Iac. 1, 12.
of Justice, which, keeping the commandementes of God in the Mat. 19, 17.
Church, we do in Io. 3, 21. and 15, 2.4.
Christ Eccli. 16, 15. Heb. 13, 16. Sap. 3, 5.6. 2 Thessalonians. 1, 5.6. Apoc. 3, 4.5
Trid. sess. 6. cap. 16. Cyp. de unit. Eccles. Aug. ep. 105. and l. demorib.
Eccles. Cathol. cap 25.
deserve. Therefore our Lord Mat. 20. Sap. 5, 16.
says: Call the work foulkes and pay the^ their hiere. Holy DAVID says:
Thy Psalm. 18. Heb. 11, 6. Luc. 14, 14. Col. 3.24. Ephesians. 6, 8. 2. Cor. 4, 17.
Aug. in Psalm. 93.
servant keeps them (to wit) the commandementes of God: In keeping them much
retribution. And again: I have Psalm 118. Mat. 19, 12. Aug. in Psalm. 120.
inclined my heart to keep thy iustifications for evermore, because of
retribution. S. PAVL also says: I have 2. Tim. 4. Aug. hom. 14. ex 50. cap.
2. and in Psalm. 83. and 100. and tract. 3. in Io 2. Conc. Araus. cap. 38. Mat.
5, 12. and 6, 4.6.17. and 10, 41. Apoc. 2, 7.10.26. and 3, 11. and 14, 13
fought a good fight, I have consu^mate my course, I have kept the faith.
Concerning the rest, there is laid up for me a crown of justice, which our
Lord will render to me in that day, a just Judge: And not only to me, but to
them also that love his coming. Finally Christ himself says: If thou Mat. 19.
wilt enter into life keep the commandementes. And again: Joan. 5. Mat. 25,
34. Aug. in Psalm. 49.
They that have done good things, shall come forth into the resurrection of
life: but they that have done evil, into resurrection of judgment. Then in an
other place: Mat. ^.
He that does the will of my father which is in heaven, he shall enter into
the Kingdom of heaven.

By all which it is made very manifest how much it stands every one of us
upon, if we desire life ever lasting, to ponder those speeches of almighty
God: Apo. 2^. Eccli. 18, 22.
He that is just, let him be justified yet: And let the holy be sanctified yet.
Behold I come quickly and my reward is with me to render to Ps. 61, 12 Mat.
16, 27. Romans 2, 6. 1. Cor. 3, 8.
every man according to his works. Therefore doing Gal. 6. Eccli. 51, 58. Aug.
in Psa. 111. and q. 4. ad Dulcitiu^.
good let us not fail for in due time we shall reap not failing.

3 How many kinds of good works be there, wherein Christian Justice is
chiefly seen and exercised?

Petr. Chrysol. ser. 43. Leo. ser. 1. et. 4. de ieiun. 10. mensis. Bern. in
sente^tiis sect. 11
THere are three kinds as we find in holy scripture, to wit, Prayer, Fasting,
and Alms. For, other good deeds, for the most part which do proceed of a
lively faith, and do set forth, increase, and consummate Christian justice,
are easelye reduced Aug. de perf. just. c. 8. respons. 17.
to these three fountains. Hereupon was that notable speech of the Angel
RAPHAEL: Prayer is Tob. 12.
good, with Fasting, and Alms, more than to hoorde up treasures of gold. And
Saint AUGUSTINE says plainly: In Ps. 42.
This is the justice of a man in this life; Fasting, Alms, and Prayer.

Of this does Christ severally entreat in S. MATTHEW'S Gospel, Mat. 6.
and adds promises of the heavenly reward prepared for those who within the
Church without hypocrisy Aug. ser. 60. de temp.
do syncerelye Fast, Pray, and give Alms. Hence is that faithful promise so
often repeted: Thy Father Mat. 6.
which sees in secret will repaie thee. And these be the very things wherein
Christ, (to the intent that we may live well and happily,) would have Mat. 5,
21.
our justice to abound, and so to shine Ibid. ver. 17.
before men, that they may see our good works and glorify the Father. To the
performance of these, we are Ephesians. 2.
created, and destinated in Christ: as the which things God has prepared that
we may walk in them. For these things done Mat. 25, 34. Io. 5, 29.
in charity, the just shall be received into the everlasting kingdom: And for
neglecting of the same, the unjust shall be cast hedlong into hell fire.

And as it is Pharisaicall Luc. 18, 11.
and full of vanity, with the contempt of others to justify himself, and to
trust to his own To. 10, 3. Trid. sess. 6. cap. 16.
works: so is it Christian like and lawful, that a man with humility
diligently attend unto good works, and if at any time he will glory, to
glory in 1. Cor. 1, 31. 2. Cor. 10, 17.
our Lord, who works in us to will, and to accomplish, as witnesses the
Phil. 2, 13.
Apostle.

4 What is fasting?

THis word has not one simple signification. A great and general fast S.
AUGUSTINE Aug. tra. 17. in Io. and l. 2. quaest. Euang. ca 18.
calls, to abstain from vices, and unlawful pleasures of the world. Then
is there a philosophical Fast, as some name it, consisting in a spare diet and
temperance of meat and drink, and moral sobriety, wherewith the very
Hieron. lib. 2. aduers. Iouin. c. 9.
Heathens according to the rule of right reason do live te^perately. Thirdly
there is an Ecclesiastical Fast Clem. Constit. Apost l. 5. cap. 12. 14. 17.
18. 19. Isid. lib. 1. offic. c. 36. and sequ. Raban. de instit. cler. lib. 2.
c. 17. and sequ. Iuo. part. 4. cap. 25. and sequ. Burch. l. 35.
to wit, when according to the certain custom and prescript of the Church we
forbear flesh diet upon some certain days, and are content with one only
repast. Which kind of Fast is after a Godly and Christian manner Cypr. de
Ieiun. and te^tationibus Christi. Athan. de Virg. Chrysostom. ho. 1. and 2. in Genesis
and sermon. 1. and 2. de Ieiun. Bas. orat. 1. and 2. de Ieiun. Aug. de vtil.
Ieiun. cap. 2. and 3. Amb. in lib. 1. de Helia. and Ieiun. and epist. 82. Leo.
in ser. de Ieiun. 7. and 10. mensis, Pentecostes, and quadrag.
undertaken to perform Gods service more religiously: to tame the flesh, and
make it subject to the spirit: to yield the worthy fruits of penance: to
exercise obedience: and finally to obtain any grace and favor at Gods hands.

5 But What answer is to be made unto those, that do reprehend and contemn
the law of the Ecclesiastical Fast?

FIrst such persons are to be admonished, that they do not fasly attribute
unto Catholics that which the Apostle does 1. Tim. 4, 1. Ccl. 2, 16. Deuteronomy. 14,
3. Can. Ap. 50 and 52. Conc. Gang. can. 2 1. Tol. in assert. fid. Brac^r. 1.
can. 14. and 32.
detest, and the Church has ever, in the Jews, Maniches, and Priscilianistes
condemned; for that, either according to the law of MOSES, or of superstition,
they do abstain from certain meats. For Catholics, as S. AUGUSTINE answers

FAVSTVS the Manichee: Whereas they abstain from flesh: they do it, for to
tame their bodies, and to restrain the more their souls from such motions as
be contrary to reason, not for that they think the flesh it self to be
unclean: neither do they abstain from flesh only, but also from some
certain fruits of the earth: either always; as a few: or at certain days
and times; as in the Lent, for the most part every one. Thus writes S.
AUGUSTINE. And before him the same also EPIPHANIVS teaches, where he confuteth
the Aerian heresy, which will have the set Haeres. 7^. and Aug. haeres. 53.
Damase, de haeres.
Fastes of the Church to be at every man's discretion, and no man to be bound
thereunto. But in that the order of time is observed in Hieron. in ep ad Gal.
cap. 4. Leo. ser. 3. and 4. de Ieiun. 7. mensis. and ser. 4. de quadrag. Ba^.
orat. 2. de Ieiun.
public Fastes, as also in Prayers, and holy days: that does confirm,
setforth, and advance the order and public concord in the Church. Besides:
private Fastes, few would impose upon themselves, as being hindered from such
endeavors, with a natural love of the flesh; and care of the belly.

Now that it is of great importance, and of assured meritte, reverently to
embrace and diligently to observe such kind of Fastes: Lib. 2. c. 5 10.11.
Aug. haeres. 22. and Amb ep. 82.
S. HIEROME proves it so plainly against IOVINIAN, that none can doubt
thereof any more. Unto which may be added those things which we have taught
before concerning the observance of the precepts of the Church: and that, for
the avoiding of Aug. ep. 118. ad Ianuar. cap. 2.
Scandal, and retaining of publcike discipline, Neither only for wrath, but
also for conscience sake, as the Apostle To. 13, 5
has said.

And it is manifest, as the writers Aug. ep. 36. Epiph. in compend. Calixt. ep.

disburden themselves and others of the Law of Fastes, taking upon themselves
the Patronage not of Evangelical liberty, but of licentiousnes of the flesh.

exhibit our selves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in watchinges,
in Fastinges, in chastity. For they Gal. 5.

7 What is Prayer?

IT is a devout affect of our mind toward God whereby we do faith fully demand

prescribed, as we have already declared.

And there is no work more Ps. 140. a Tob. 12. c Act. 10. a Ex. 32. c Ps. 105.

commended in holy scripture; none, more familiar with devout and holy
persons; none, that of more persons, and more often, and with greater
diligence, and more necessarily is to be exercised in this life, than is
prayer. It is a true saying: Eccles. 35. d Ps. 105. c 36. alud. 9. d
The prayer of him that humbles himself, shall pearce the clouds. Also, Lu.

it behooves always to pray, to wit, with a zealous affect of heart, and
without hypocrisy, or respect of the praise Mat. 6. a

and truth. Notwithstanding they that do pray, do often use an external

therein they do very well, as appears by the examples of holy Scripture.
For even Christ our Lord sometimes with Io. 17. a 11. a

Publicane, that he made his prayer in the Temple, with an humble countenance,
his eyes cast downwarde and knocking of his breast. Which things certes though
they seem external, and may be done eue^ by wicked persons for ostentatio^
sake: yet do they deserve praise and commendation, in that they both exercise
the body deuoutely, and bring it into the obedience of the Creator; and stir
up the mind, confirm and strengthen it, in the interior worship. These are
moreover certain testimonies of faith, humility, and piety, in no case to be
neglected; as being things that do procure much edification, not only to the
beholders, but also to the wholle Church.

8 Why is it, that it behooves us so diligently and daily to pray?

FIrst because of the great and infinite commodities that redounde to them
that pray as they should. Isid. de summo bono l. 3. cap. 7 Aug. sermon. 226. and
230 de temp. and ep. 121. ca. 8 and sequ. and ser. 5. de verb Dom. cap. 4 and
sequ. Cypr. de or. Do. Amb. l. 3. de Virg. et ser. 93. de Nazario. and Celso.
Then also, for that prayer is a proper and necessary exercise of faith.
Moreover, it is every where commanded in divine Mat. 26. d Mat. 13. d. Luc. 18.
a 11. a b 21. g Eccli. 18 c 21. a To. 12. c Phil. 4. b Col. 4. a 1. Pet. 4 b 1 Thessalonians. 5. c f 6. c 1. Tim. 5. a Heb. 4. d Luc. 1. a 4. a 5. d
scripture, and it has a promise not only often repeated, but also such a one
as is excellent and full of all consolation and sweetness. Mar. 11. c Mat. 21.
b. 18. c d
I say to you, says the truth himself Christ, all things whatsoever you
ask, praying, believe that you shall receive, and they shall come unto you.
And again: I say Luc. 11. b Mat. 7. b Io. 14. b 15. a 10. d 1. Io. 3. d 5. c
Psalm. 49. c 144. d Pro. 15. d 2. Par. 7. c Eccli. 2. b 3. a 38. a I^cuit. 4. f
g 5. c d 6. a
to you, ask and it shall be given you: seek and you shall find: knock and
it shall be opened to you: for every one that asks receives: and he that
seeks, finds: and to him that knocks, it shall be opened: And again: If
you Mat. 7. b Luc. 11. c
being naught, know how to give good guiftes to your children; how much more
will your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?
With such kind of speeches, as well notes Saint CHRYSOSTOM, and with such a
Lib. 1. de orand. Deu^. vide etiam l. 2. and ho. 5. de incomprehensib. Dei
natura, and ad pop. Antioch. ho. 71. and 79. Greg. ho. 27. in Euang. and in Ps.
6. Poenit.
hope has the Lord of all things provoked us to pray. It is our part, that
being obedient to almighty God, we pass over our whole life in the praise of
god and in prayer, using more diligence and care about the service of God, then
about our own life. For so it will come to pass, that we shall always lead
our life worthy of a man. Thus far Saint CHRYSOSTOM.

9 By what examples may we gather, what the force and commodity of prayer is?

THe Apostle S. JAMES, to the intent he might explicate the virtue of prayer,
with an example, wrote thus: ELIAS Iac. 5. d 3. Reg. 17. a d and. 18. f g Luc.
4. d Eccli. 48. a
was a man like unto us passible: and with prayer he prayed that it might not
rain upon the earth, and it rained not for three years and six months. And
he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth yielded her fruit.
S. AUGUSTINE Aug. ser. 22. ad stat. in Eremo.
proves the same thing with many more examples: MOSES, Exodus 17. c d Judith.
4. c d
and SAMVEL 1. Reg. 7. c d
praying, the Jews overcame their enemies, the Amalechites, and the
Philistians. HIEREMIE praying, is Hier. 32. c d f
comforted and strengthened in prison. DANIEL Dan 6. c f
praying, triumphs amongst the Lions. The three Dan. 3. c e
Children praying do dance in the furnace. The Thief Luc. 23. f
praying upon the Cross, does find Paradise. SUSANNA Dan. 13. c
by prayer is defended amiddest the Elders that accused her falsely. S. STEVEN
Act. 7. g. Hier. contra Vigilant. c. 3 Aug. ser. 1. and 4. de Sa^ctis.
praying is received into heaven, and heard in the behalf of SAVL amongst
the^ that stoned him.

By which Genesis 25. c Exodus 8. c g 9. g 10. c 14. c d 32. c f Number. 11. a 12. d
14. c 16 c e g 21. b 1. Reg. 1. b d 12. c 4. Reg. 19. c g 20. a 2. Par. 20. a c
e 33. c 1. Esd. 8. c Tob. 3. a b d Judith. 9. a d 13. a Ps. 17. a 119. a Ionae.
2. a 1. Mac. 3. f 4. a b Act. 12. a
examples, not only is declared the profit of prayer; but also the love and
diligence of praying is commended unto us. Wherefore the Apostolical writings
do thus exhort us: Pray without intermission, 1. These. 5. c
in all things give thanks: And again: Pray one Iac. 5. d
for an other that you may be saved, for the continual prayer of a just man
avails much. In like manner: This 1. Io. 5. c
is the considence which we have toward God, that whatsoever we shall ask
according to his will, he hears us. Moreover: he that 1. 5. d
knows his brother to sin a sin not to death, let him ask and life shall
be given him.

OF ALMS AND THE WORKS OF MERCY.
10 What is Alms?

Vide Chrysostom. ho. 13. in 2. Cor. et Aug sermon. 30. de verb. Do. c. 3
IT is a gift or benefit, whereby upon an affection of compassion we do
succor an other man's misery. Heereunto beelongeth that which the Angel
RAPHAEL testifies in TOBIAS: Prayer is good, Tob. 12. b
with Fasting and Alms: That we may understand, as S. CYPRIAN De opere and
eleemos. item Petr. Chrysol. ser. 43. Leo. ser. 3. de Ieiun. Pentecost. Osc. 6.
c. Mat. 6. b 12. a Pro 21, a Phil 4. d Heb. 13. c
admonishes, that our prayers and fastings are little available unless they
be helped with Alms. Good, is mercy, says S. AMBROSE Lib. 1. offic. o. 11.
Chrysostom. ho. 36. ad pop. Ant. Aug. ser. 76. de temp. and hom. 36. ex 50. Leo.
ser. 5. and 10. de quadrag. Nyss. de beatitud.
which of her self makes men perfect, because it does imitate the Father,
which is perfect. Nothing does so commend a Christian soul as mercy. Thus
says he. Luc. 6. d Psalm. 32. a 118. h 144. b c
Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful, that you may be
the sons of your Father which is in heaven, who makes his son to rise upon
the good, and the evil, and raineth upon the just, and unjust. Thus says
Christ our Savior, and our Luc. 10. f
Samaritane, full of all grace and mercy, who went Act. 10. f
throughout doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the Devil.

11 In what manner does the scripture commend Alms unto us?

With many certes, Deuteronomy. 15. b Esd. 8. c Tob. 4. b Psalm. 40. a Pro. 11. c 14.
c d 19. c 22. b 25. c 28. d Eccli. 4. a b d 7. a d 12. a 17. c 29. b Ezech. 18.
b c Mat. 25. d. Luc. 14. c
and plain precepts, promises and examples. Yea S. CYPRIAN De opere and
eleem. Vide Aug. ser. 50. cap. 8. and sequ. and 227. de temp. and hom. 18
19.29. cap. 1. and sequ. and 47. ex 50. Nazian. orat. 16. de paup. amore. Chrysostom
ho. 32. ad pop. and sequ.
teaches, that in the gospel there is nothing more often commanded than that
we persevere in giving Alms, that we be not busied in earthly possessions, but
rather lay up treasures in heaven. Hence are those speeches of Christ: But Luc.
11. f Hieron. ad Hedib. ep. 150. quest. 1
yet, that which remains give alms: and behold al things are Aug. in Ench.
c. 75.76.77. and ser. 30. de verb. Dom.
clean unto you. Luc. 12. d 3. c Mat. 6. a c 19. c d Mar. 10. c 1. Tim. 6. d
Sell the things that you posses and give Alms, make to you purses that wear
not, treasure that wastes not in heaven. And in an other place: Make unto you
Luc. 16. c Aug. ser. 25. c. 3. and 35. c. 1. and seq. de verb. Dom.
friends of the Mammon of iniquity: that when you fail they may receive you
into the eternal Tabernacles. In brief: give, and there Luc. 6. f 2. Cor. 8.
b c 9. b 1. Tim. 4. c To. 12. c d Iac. 1. d
shall be given to you. And for that cause DANIEL the Prophet counseleth the
wicked King: Redeem Dan. 4. c Pro. 13. b. Amb. ser. 30 and 31. and de Helia
and Ieiun. cap. 20. Leo. in ser. de collectis. Chrysostom. hom. 25. in Act.
thy sins with Alms and thy iniquities with the mercies of the poor. Then
in an other place we read: Water Eccli. 3. d Amb. sermon. 15. Chrysostom. hom. 34. in
Genesis Pros. part. 2. de promiss. and praedict. tionibus. c. 7
does quench the burning fire, and Alms resistethe sins. And not of a man
certes, but of an Angel was that speech: Alms Tob. 12. b 4. b Esa. 1. c Pro.
15. d 16 a 10. b 1. Pet 4. b Iac. 5. d
delivers from death, and she it is that purges sins, and makes a man to
find mercy, and life everlasting. Yea and Christ himself pronounces: Mat.
10. d Greg. ho. 5. in Euang. Amb. in lib. de viduis. Leo. ser. 4. and 6. de qua
drag. and ser. 6, de Ieiun. 10. mensis.
Whosoever shall give drink to one of these little ones, a cup of cold
water, only in the name of a Disciple; Amen I say to you, he shall not loose
his reward. Blessed Mat. 5. a
therefore are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy. And contrariwise
as S. JAMES affirms: Iac. 2. b. Pro. 21. b.
Judgment without mercy to him that has not done mercy.

12 With what examples is the effect and profit of Alms declared?

IN the holy scripture, ABRAHAM and LOATH Genesis 18. a 19. a
through hospitality are said both to have pleased God, and to have
entertained He. 13. a
Angels. The Alms Tob. 12. c 1. d
of TOBIE and the Centurion Act. 10. a See notable examples of Alms in these
Saints lives. Ioannis Eleemosinarii* apud Leentium. Martini apud Sulpitium.
Paulae apud Hieron. ep. 27. cap. 7. Paulini apud Greg. Turon. de glor. Conf.
cap. 107. and apud Greg. 3. dial. c. 1. Tiber. apud Turon. lib. 5 hist. Franc.

were so auailable that they ascended into remembrance, in the sight of God,
and had the holy Angels not only for witnesses, but also for commendors.
ZACHEVS moved by the words of Christ, and of a prince of Publicans being made a
mirror of mercy: gives half his goods to the poor and is presently
pronounced the Luc. 19. a b
son of ABRAHAM, by Christ himself. TABITHA Act. 9. f g Vide etiam Pratum
Sprituale Sophronii. cap. 175. 185. 195. and 201
is praised by S. LVKE as being full of good works and Alms, which she bestowed
especially upon widows. So are those devout Matrons singulerly commended in
the Luc. 8. and 10. g Joan. 12 a 3. Reg 17. b c d 4. Reg. 4. b c f
Gospel, which with MAGDALEN and MARTHA did liberally minister of their goods,
to Christ our Lord and to his poor disciples. And of Saint LAVRENCE the Amb.
lib 2. offic. cap. 28.
Leuite and Martyr it is most justly soung: Ps. 111. b Chry. ho. 55 in Genesis
He dispersed, he gave to the poor: his righteousness remains for evermore.

13 What is mercy?

IT is as S. AUGUSTINE Lib. 9. ciu cap. 5. Isid. de summo bono. lib. 3. cap.
64. Nys. in l. de beatitud.
affirms, a certain compassion in our heart of an other man's misery,
whereby we are compelled to yield succor, if it lie in our power. Which name
of mercy is wont very often to be taken for Alms. And all manner of mercy
as witnesses the divine scripture Eccli. 16. b
shall make a place unto every man according to the merit of his works. Very
often and wonderfully does Saint CHYSOSTOME Hom. 32. in epist. ad Heb. ho. 9.
de poenit. 53. in Mat. and 36. ad pop. Ant.
commend the same, and he doubts not in a certain place to say: Chrysostom. ho.
de miser. and duabus viduis.
Mercy is the fortress of salvation, the ornament of faith, the propitiation
of sins: she it is that approves the just persons, confirms the holy, and
sets forth the servants of God. Yea and if we believe Saint AMBROSE, In ep.
1. ad Tim. c. 4. vide eund. in Luc. 3.
the wholle sum of Christian discipline consists in mercy and piety.

14 Are the works of Mercy of one kind only?

THey are Aug. lib. de mor. b. Eccles. Cathol. cap. 27. and 28. Ench. c. 72.
and ser. 203. de tempore.
found to be of two sorts: for as much as some be corporal, some spiritual.
Some are certes called corporal, because they are exercysed for the releeuing
of the corporal misery of our neighbor: other spiritual, for that in them
we do well provide and lauour for the spiritual good of our neighbor. Of this
diversity of mercy, the most bountiful JOB gives a most clear example, who
witnesses of himself: Job. 31. b and ibid. Greg.
From my infancy, has mercy increased with me, and from my mothers womb she
came forth with me. I have been an eye Job. 29. c
to the blind, and a foot to the lame. I was the father of the poor, and the
cause which I knew not, I did diligently search out. I did consume the grinding
stones of the wicked man, and out of his teeth I did take the pray. Also: The
stranger stood not without Job. 31. d
doors, my door was open to the traueiler.

15 How many works of mercy be there both corporal and spiritual?

THere are seven accounted of each kind. And first certes the corporal works
are these: Mat. 25. d
To feed the hungry: To give drink to the thirsty: To cloathe the naked: To
redeem the captive: To visit the sick: To harbor Pilgrims: Tob. 1. d 2. a
b 12. c 2. Reg. 2. a Aug. lib. 1. eiu. cap. 13. and de cura mor. cap. 3.
To bury the dead.

And the spiritual works are these: To correct Mat. 18. b 1. Tim. 5. c.
those that sin: To teach the Eccli. 18. b 2 Timothy 4. a Esa. 52. b Hier. 15. b

ignorant: To give good counsel Pro. 17. b Eccli. 5. c
to them that are in doubt: To pray Mat. 5. g Iac. 5. d
to God for the welfare of our neighbor: To comfort Eccli. 7. d 2. Cor. 1. a
the sorrowful: To bear injuries Tit. 3. a 1. These. 5. c Romans 15. a
patiently: To forgive Mat. 5. d 6. b 18. c d Mar. 11. c Eccli. 28. a
offenses. Which offices of humane piety are so plain and evident espeacially
unto Christians and to those which are not altogether barbarous: that they
need not any long discourse.

16 How are these declared in holy Scripture?

VEry plainly certes, and in every place: as notablely those words of ESAIAS, or
rather the precepts of God, do declare: Esa. 58. b
Break, says he, thy bread to the hungry: the needy, and wandering, bring
into thy house: when thou shall see a naked man, cloathe him: and thy flesh
do thou not despise. Of which offices, the great profit and commodity is
after annexed in the same place. Ibid. c
Then thy justice shall go before thy face: and the glory of our Lord shall
gather thee. And Saint JOHN, who wholly labors in commending unto us
brotherly charity and mercy, amongst other things teaches: 1. Io. 3. c Iac.
2. c Bas. ho. 7. in diuites auaros. Amb. ser. 81. and apud Gratia. did. 86.
ide^ lib. 3. offic. cap. 6. and 7. Greg. 3. p. curae past. adm. 22. Greg.
Turo^. in glor. Co^f. cap. 108.
He that shall have the substance of this world: and shall see his brother
have need, and shall shut his bowels from him: how does the Charity of God
abide in him? And not content with this speech, he concludes in most excellent
manner: My little children, let us not love in word, and in tongue, but in
deed and truth. In this we know that we are of the truth.

These are the works of the faithful, and of those that are truly just, which
in the Mat. 25. d Luc. 14. c
last judgment Christ will acknowledge, and publicly approve: for the which he
will allot the promised kingdom, and render a crown of Justice unto the
merciful, whom also himself calls Just.

Which works Greg. vbi supra adm. 21. Amb. lib. 1. offic. c. 30. and l. 2. c.
21. and 25. Chry. ho. de miser and duabus Viduis. and hom. 30. in 1. Cor.
certes do afford so much the more of true praise and eternal reward; by how
much the more syncerely, cherefully, and liberally they are done by a Christian
mind. Which then is performed, when there is as little respect as may be unto
humane vanity and desires; but they are wholly directed unto the glory of God,
and the profit of our neighbor who is benifited. To this end are those
speeches of holy Scripture to be observed: He To. 12. b
that gives, in simplicity: he that shows mercy, in cheerfulness: Tob. 4. b
Turn not away thy face from any poor man. According to thy ability be thou
merciful, God loves a 2. Cor. 9. b
cheerful giver. In every Eccli. 35. b
gift make thy countenance cheerful. Pleasant Ps. 111. a
is that man that takes compassion and profits Christ certes in S. LVKE
describes such Luc. 10. f
a Samaritane, as may be a notable example of exhibiting willingly the highest
kind of courtesy and perfect mercy even unto strangers, and Nazian. orat.
19. in funere Patris. Chrysostom. ho. 21. in ep. ad Romans and ho. 35. and 37. ad pop.
Ant
the undeserving: But, He that 2. Cor. 9. b
sows sparingly, sparingly also shall reap, As witnesses the Apostle. And
this shall suffice touching the corporal works of mercy.

17 But what does the scripture testify of those that are spiritual?

WE, says he, that are To. 15. a
stronger must sustain the infirmities of the weak, and not please our selves.
Let every one of you please his neighbor unto God, to edification. For Christ
did not please himself. And again: Be ye gentle Ephesians. 4. g
one to another, merciful, pardoning one another, as God in Christ has
pardoned you. Again: Be ye therefore followers Ephesians. 5. a
of God, as most dear children: and walk in love, as Christ also loved us.
Moreover: Put ye on Col. 3. b
therefore as the elect of God holy, and beloved, the bowels of mercy,
benignity, humility, modesty, patience, supporting one an other: And
pardoning Aug. Enchir. cap. 73. and 74. ho. 6. 29. cap. 1. and 40. cap. 3. and
seq. ex 50. and sermon. 203. de temp. Greg. 4. dial. cap. vlt.
one an other, if any have a quarrel against any man: as also our Lord has
pardoned us: So you also. And again: 1 Thessalonians. 5. c
Admonish the unquiet, comfort the weak minded, bear up the weak, be
patient to all.

These and many other things of like tenor does Saint PAVL every where
inculcate: who to the intent he might save 1. Cor. 9. d
all, was made all things to all men: So that hereupon himself testifies:
Who is weak, 2. Cor. 11. g
and I am not weak? who is scandalized, and I am not burnt? And again: I have
great Romans 9. a
sadness, and continual sorrow in my heart. For I wished my self an Anathema
from Christ for my brethren. And in an other place: I most gladly 2. Cor. 12. e
will bestow, and will my self moreover be bestowed for your souls: although
loving you more I am louedlesse.

18 What is the sum of all the doctrine touching the performance of the works
of mercy?

THe Apostle has comprised the wholle matter as it were in this one word:
Bear ye Gal. 6. a
one an others burdens: and so you shall fulfill the law of Christ, to wit,
the law of charity, of which law again he says: To. 13. e Gal. 5. c
If there be any other commandment: it is comprised in this word: thou shall
love thy neighbor as thy self. And the Apostle S. PETER: 1. Pet. 4, b
Before all things, says he, having mutual Charity continual among your
selves: because charity covers the multitude of sins. Which precepte or
office of showing mercy and charity, as it is most agreeable to nature, and
reason: so does it touch even all kinds of men without exception: in so much
that of this we read it written: Eccli. 17. b
God has given every man a charge of his neighbor. And he has given charge
in this manner, as Christ interprets: Mat. 7. b Luc. 6. c
All things whatsoever you will that men do to you, do you also to them: for
this is the law and the Prophettes.

OF THE CARDINAL VERTVES.
1 What means the name and nature of Cardinal virtues?

Certain virtues be therefore Vid. Ambros. in Luc. 6. and lib. 1. offic. ca.
24. Prosp. de vita contemplatiua. lib. 3. cap. 18.
called Cardinal, because they be as it were fountains and hingels of all the
rest: and as the door turns upon the hingells, so the wholle course of
honest life consists of them, and the wholle frame of good works does seem
after a sort to depend Greg. l. 2. mor. cap. 36
upon them. And they are accounted four in Amb. lib. 3. de Virg. et l. 2.
offic. c. 9
number: Prudence, Justice, Temperance, and Fortitude. Whereof it is thus
written. She teaches Sap. 8. b
Sobriety, and Prudence, and Justice, and Virtue: Than the which things there
is nothing in life more profitable unto men. Where, by Sobriety, Aug. l. 1.
retract. c. 7.
Temperance; by Virtue, fortitude; is not obscurelie signified: And all of them
are so commended unto us, that we may assuredly understand, that by the
eternal wisdom Pro. 8. b c d Eccli. 24. a c
which is God, they are properly bestowed, and are received and exercised with
very great fruit of man's salvation. Which virtues are called also Officiales,
that is, appertaining to offices or duties, because that from them, as Lib. 1.
offic. c. 25.
Saint AMBROSE has noted do spring the diverse kinds of offices; and are
derived all manner of duties appertaining to the ordinary life of man,
according to every man's vocation.

2 How are the Cardinal virtues defined?

Vide Aug. l. 1. de l. arb. c. 13. and lib. de morib. Eccl. Cathol. cap 15.
Amb. in libris de officiis. Prosp. l. 3. de vita co^templatiua c. 18. and seq.
Ber. ex paruis. ser. 35. and in Cant. ser. 22.
PRudence, is a virtue which according to the rule of honesty prescribes what
is to be desired, and what is to be eschewed by a man. Justice, is a virtue
whereby we give every man his own. Temperance, is a virtue moderating the
pleasures of the flesh, which are fealt in tasting and touching. Fortitude, is
a virtue whereby labors, and dangers of death are constantly both undertaken,
and suffered out.

This is the noble chariot of virtues, whereby we are carried into heaven:
These are the four rivers of Genesis 2. b
Paradise, as Lib. 2. de Genesis contr. Manic. c. 10. Amb. lib. de Paradis. c. 3.
S. AUGUSTINE calls them: of whom also this saying of worthy memory is
extant: That, says he, is the science and knowledge of L. 1. cont Acad. cap. 7.
humane things, which knows the light of Prudence, the dece^cie of
Temperance, the strength of Fortitude, the holiness of Justice. For these are
they, which fearing no fortune, we may be bold to call truly our own.

3 How is Prudence commended unto us in holy Scripture? Bas. in constit.
Monast. c. 15. and ho. 12. in Principium Prouerbiorum. Bern. ser. 49. in Cant.


VVIselye does Ecclesiasticus teach us in this manner: Eccli. 32. d 37. c Pro.
12 c 1^. b
My son, without advice do nothing, and after thy deed thou shall not
repent thee. And again: Eccli. 31 d 18. d 33. a Pro. 14. b Job. 28. d Deuteronomy. 4*
32 d vide Pro. 3. b 8. b Sap. 6. a c d 7. a b d
A wise heart that has understanding will keep it self from sin, and in the
works of Justice it shall have success. Also the Eccli. 1. a
fountain of all Wisdom and Prudence, Christ, that true Mat. 1^. d Luc. 11. d
SOLOMON teaches thus: Be ye Mat. 10. b and ib. Theophyl. and Hieron. Aug. q.
8. ex Matthew. Greg. lib. 1. mor. c. 2. and ho. 30. in Euang. Prosp. lib. 3. de
vit. contempl. c. 29. and 30.
wise as Serpents, and simple as Doves, to the intent that we may understand,
that to perfect Prudence, both, are jointly required, to wit, both the
simplicitiy of the dove, which makes men meek and innocent: And the Prudence
of the Serpent, which makes men circumspect and provident: so that they
neither deceive, nor be of others deceived. That, shall be brought to pass, if
we conform ourselves to the doctrine of S. PAVL. See Ephesians. 5. d Col. 4. a 1.
Pet. 4. ^ Pro. 4. d Eccles. 2. c
brethren says he, home you walk warely: not as unwise, but is wise:
redeeming the time because the days are evil. Therefore become not unwise:
but understanding what is the will of God, to wit, To. 12. a 1 Thessalonians. ^. a
good, acceptable, and perfect. And heereunto appertains that speech of
SOLOMON: He Pro. 13. d Eccli. 6. d
that goes with wise men, shall be wise; a friend of fools shall become like
unto them. And this also: In the Pro. 17. d Eccles. ^. a
face of a wise man shines wisdom. Finally that which the same affirms:
The Pro. 18. c
heart of a wiseman shall possess knowledge, and the ear of wise men seeks
Doctrines.

4 Of Justice, what does the holy Scripture deliver unto us?

I^stice aduaunceth Pro. 14. d 15. b 21. c Eccli. 4. d
the Nation: by Pro. 16. b 25. a Aug. l. 4. ciu. c. 4. and l. 19. cap. 21.
Greg. l. 7. ep. 120. ad reg. Franciae.
Justice the Throne is established. Better is a little with Justice, than ^anie
fruits with iniquity. And the office of this Justice does the A^^^tle
explicate unto us in these words: To 13. c Mat. 22. c 17. d Luc. 2. a 3. c 1.
Tim. 5. c Bern. ser. 3. de adu. Aug. ser. 19. de verb. Do. and l. 22. cont
Faust cap. 74. and 75. Theoph. in c. 13 ad To.
Render to all men their due: To whom tribute, tributes. To who^ custom,
custom: To whom fear, fear: To whom honor, honor: Hereunto belongs those
parts of a just and happy man thus set down Phil. 14. a b Mat 5 a Chry. ho.
15. in Mat. Amb. l 1. offic. c. 28. and 29. and ser. 16. in Ps. 118. and in l.
de Parad. c. ^. Aug. l. 4. doct. c. 18. See the 7. and 8. Command.
in the Psalm: He that has not done deceit in his tongue, nor has caused
evil to his neighbor, and has not admitted a reproach against his neighbors:
he that swears to his neighbor, and does not deceive: He that has not given
his money to Exo. 22. d Leuit. 25. c Deuteronomy. 23. c Ezech. 18. b c d 22. c Luc. 6.
c Leo. ser. 6. de ieiun. 10. mensis. Ber. ep. 322. ad Spirenses. Amb. de Tob.
cap. 14. and 15. Hieron. in 18. c. Ezech. Conc. Later. sub Alexand. 3 part. 1.
cap. 25.
usury, and has not taken rewards against the innocent. By which we may
easily see that the name of Justice is here taken after a more stricte manner,
then where we discoursed of Christian Justice in general.

5 How does the scripture teach Temperance?

FOr the eschewing of intemperance, this does the scripture enioin us, that we
make not the provision To. 13. d 1. Pet. 2. c Gal. 5. c* 1. Cor. 9. d
of the flesh in co^cupiscences, nor that by Luc. 21. g See before of Gluttony
and Fasting.
glottonie our hearts be at any time over charged with surfeiting and
drunkenness. But it exhorts to the exercise of temperance, where it wills
us 1. Pet. 5. c 1 Thessalonians. 5. b 1. Tim. 3. a c 2. Tim. 4. a Tit. 1. c. 2. a b c
Leuit. 10, b
to be sober and to watch, that is to say, by holy watchinges and prayers, to
be ready, that we give not Ephesians. 4. f
place to the Devil. For which cause Ecclesiasticus also gives this
admonition: Eccli. 31. b
Use like a thriftie man, the things that are set before thee, that when
thou eatest much thou be not had in contempt. Neither does he forget to
co^demn dronke^nes; For much Ibid. d
wine being drunk, makes provoking, and anger and many ruins. Yea also as
the same says: Wine and Eccli. 19.
women, make wise me^ to become Apostates. Therefore of drincking wine
te^perately, he adds this also: The exultation Eccli. 31. d
of the soul and of the heart, is wine moderately druncke: health to the soul
and the body is sober drinking. And therefore we read it written also in an
other place: Eccles. 10. c
Blessed is the land whose Princes do eat in due time, to refreshing, and
not unto lechery. Eccli. 37. d
And he that is abstinent, shall increase life. But this virtue of Te^perance
extends it self further Vide Prosp. lib. 3. de vita contemplatiua cap. 19.
Amb. l. 1. de Jacob. cap. 2 Hier. in cap. 44. Ezech.
than to the moderate taking of meat and drink. Mat. 3. a 11. a c Mar. 1. a
Luc. 1. b g 7. d e Bern. in ser. de natiuit. Io. Baptist. Greg. ho. 6. in Euang.
S. IHON Baptiste, (if ever any other) exhibited himself unto us a most
perfect and absolute example of Temperance, Abstinence, yea and of all manner
of Continency, when as he cut off from himself all manner of excess in diet
and aparell, and contenting himself with a marueilouse kind of frugalitie,
passed over his life in the wilderness.

6 What admonishes the scripture touching Fortitude?

TO the use and practice hereof it exhorts us sufficiently when it forbids
a perverse Mat. 10. c 8. c Luc. 12 a d Esa. 8. c 35. a 41. c d 43. a 44. a 51.
c d Hier. 10. a Eccli 7. a 34. b Pro. 3. c Psalm. 3. b 22. a 26. a 55. b 117. a
Esa. 12 a Heb. 12. a b c d
fear; and commends unto us confidence, cherefulnes, constancy, and
magnanimity of a Christian mind: Pro. 28. a Job. 15. c 6 c Pro. 29. d Eccli.
22. c Psalm. 13. c Io. 12. f Apoc. 21. b 2. Cor. 1. c Mat. 11. a Gal 3. a Pr.
15. a 27. b Eccli. 27. b
The wicked man flies when no man pursues him says SOLOMON: But the just man
as a confident Lion shall be without fear. And S. PETER giuethe this admonition
touching the enemies of Faith, and Piety: 1. Pet 3. c
The fear of them, fear ye not, and be not troubled. Who Ibid. and 2. d 4. c
is he that can hurt you, if you be emulatours of good? But if you suffer
ought for Justice, blessed Mat. 5. a Luc. 6. c
are ye. And S. PAVL being himself an invincible 1. Cor. 4. c 2. Cor. 4. b c
6. a b 11. f 12. c Act. 20. e 21. c 2. Tim. 4. b To. 8. f g
soldier of Christ does often encourage others to true and Christian fortitude:
My beloved 1. Cor. 15 g 16. c 9 d To. 11. c Gal. 6. c 2 Thessalonians. 3. c Teb 2. c
Eccles. 10. a Eccli. 4. d 5 c 11. c 2. Par. 15 b Iac. 5. b Heb. 10. f Mat. 10.
c 24. b Bern. epist. 129. ad Ianuenses.
brethren says he, be stable and immovable: abounding in the work of our Lord
all ways, knowing that your labor is not vain in our Lord. And again:
Brethren be Ephesians. 6. b Esa 40. g Pro. 14. c 2. Paral. 16. c lac. 4. b 1. Pet.
5. c Vide Prosp. l 3. de vira contempl c. 20. Amb. l. 1. offic. c. 35. and seq.
strengthened in our Lord and in the might of his power. Put you on the armor
of God that you may stand against the deceiptes of the Devil, and resist in
the evil day, and stand in all things perfect.

Of a man that has Fortitude these are the proper speeches. I have Ps. 55. a c
trusted in God, I will not fear what flesh can do unto me. Our Ps. 26. a
Lord is the protector of my life, of whom shall I tremble? If whole armies
stand against me, my heart shall not be affraide. If I Ps. 22. a
shall walk in the midst of the shaddowe of death, I will not fear evils,
because thou art with me. Who To. 8. g
shall separate us from the charity of Christ? Phil. 4. c
I ca^ al things in him that strengthens me. This is that which the most
courageous King DAVID 1. Reg. 17. d 2. Reg. 14. d 16. b c 17. b 23. a Psalm. 17.
c
, as it were soundinge the allarume to all the sons of god, his fellow
soldiers, does say: Do Psa. 30. d
manfully and let your heart be comforted, all you that trust in our Lord. In
god Ps. 107. d Heb. 11. f g Dan. 3. b 1. Match. 2. b f g 2 Mac. 7. a f Act. 4. c

we will do virtue, and he will bring to nothing those that trouble us. But
that certes is a life worthy of a Christian man, wherein we do live wisely,
justly, temperately, and with fortitude. Hence is it that golden Bern. lib. 2.
de consid. cap. 10.
mediocritie, that we do nothing too much nor too little. This is that which
the Scripture means, when it says: Do thou Pro. 4. b
not decline either on the right hand, or on the left.

OF THE GIFTS AND FRVITES OF THE HOLY GHOST.
1 How many gifts of the holy Ghost be there?

THey are found in ESAIE the Prophet, Esa. 11 a and ibid. Hieron. Amb. lib. 1.
de spiritu sancto c. 20. Aug. ser. 209. de temp. c. 4. and 17. de sanct. c. 2.
Item l. 1. de ser. Do in monte. c. 3. and 4. and l 2 de doctrina Christ. c. 7.
Greg. ho. 19 in Ezech. and lib. 1. moral cap. 28. and lib 35 cap. 7 Bern. in
ser. de donis Spir. Sanct.
and the Fathers of the Church, to be seven. The Spirit of wisdom, of
Understanding, of Council, of Fortitude, of Science, of Piety, and finally
the spirit of the fear of our Lord.

Which gifts certes, or spirits, are found to be after a more perfect Orig.
ho. 3. in Esa. and ho. 6. in Nu^.
manner in CHRIST JESUS our Lord than in any other. For he is full of grace
Io. 1. b
and truth. In him does inhabit all the fulness of the Divinity Col. 2. b
corporally. Of his Io. 1, b
fulness we all have received: who has also given 1. Io. 4. c
unto us of his holy spirit. And if To. 8, b
any man have not the spirit of Christ, he is not his; if we believe the
Apostle.

2 How many are the fruits of the holy Ghost?

THey are of the same Apostle S. PAVL Gal. 5, d vide ib. Hier. Theop. etc.
numbered Twelve.

The first is Col. 3, c 1. Joan. 4, c Aug. tra. 87. in Euang. Io. Hier. in c.
5. ad Gal.
CHARITY, the most excelent kind of fruit, and the root also of all good
things: Without the which 1. Cor. 13. a Aug. in ep. Io. tra. 5.
all other good things cannot profit, and which cannot herself be had without
all other good things, whereby a man is made good: as says In Eua^g. Io.
tract. 87.
S. AUGUSTINE.

An other fruit is Phil. 4 a
JOY: excelling in this, that a spiritual man do serve God cheerfully and
with alacrity.

The third is PEACE: Luc 2, b Phil. 4, b Psalm. 118, ^
which seruethe to this end, that in the storms of this world the
tranquillity of the mind be kept.

The fourth is Luc. 21, d Iac. 1, a
PATIENCE: which consists in suffering adversity.

The fifth is LONGANIMITY: Aba. 2. a 2. Cor. 6. b Mat. 10, c
which does declare the greatness of the mind in expecting good things to come.

The sixth is GOODNESS: which Ephesians. 5, b
hurts no man, and wishes well to all.

The seventh is BENIGNITY: Col. 3, b
inuiting to familiarity, sweet in speech, temperate in manners.

The eigthe is MILDNES: Mat. 5, a 11. d Pro. 31, d
which does qualify and mitigate all the motions of anger.

The ninthe is FAITH, or FIDELITY 1. Tim. 3, c Pro. 12, d
toward our neighbor, that we be faithful and obseruers of all couenantes
and promises.

The tenth is MODESTY: Phil. 4, a
which excludethe all suspicion of haughtines and arrogancy.

The eleventh is CONTINENCY: Eccli. 37 d Tob. 1, b 1 Thessalonians. 5, d
whereby we do not only abstain from meat, but from all manner of wickedness.

The twelueth is CHASTITY: Sap. 4, a 1. Cor. 7, f
which keeps a chaste mind in a chaste body.

3 How may we rightly use the doctrine concerning the gifts and fruits of the
Holy Ghost?

BY this means surely, if with gratful minds we acknowledge from whence they
come unto us, and feel the effectual virtue and use of them in ourselves, and
show forth and preserve the same. They proceed, certes, from the fountain of
all grace, that Father Iac. 1, ^
of lights who in the same commends unto us his infinite goodness and
charity; whilst through Christ, he does so Tit. 3, b
abounda^tly power his spirit upon us: For To. 5, ^
the charity of God, as witnesses the Apostle, is powered forth in our hearts,
by the holy Ghost which is given us, to wit, according to this seven fold
grace: Christ so deserving in our behalf. He that Io. 7, f
believes in me, says he, as the scripture says, out of his belly shall
flow rivers of living water. And this he said of the Spirit that they should
receive which believed in him, as the Evangelist himself expounds. Otherwise
without Christ, as S. HIEROME In c. Esa. 11.
has said, neither can any man be wise, nor intelligent, nor a counselour,
nor courageous, nor learned, nor godly, nor full of the fear of God.

And the virtue and use of these spiritual goods, do tend to this end, that
the virtues Theological, and Cardinal, which we have spoken of, may readilye
perform their force and proper operation in us. Also they bring to pass that
men do very willingly, and with sweetness, follow every where the Psa.
142, c 50, c Sap. 1, a b
holy Ghost as guide, and by him being moved and strengthened, do without
fainting run forewarde in the way Ps. 118, d
of the Commandments of God, and are made truly Spiritual, and the children
of God. Romans 8, ^
Whosoever are lead by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God, as
witnesses the Apostle.

Of these gifts it were too long, to discourse in particular, but from thence
do proceed the most sweet fruits of the holy Ghost, which do commend and set
us forth, as fruitful Psalm. 51, c
trees, in the field of the Church, according to that saying: Every Mat. 7, c
Hier. in cap. 5. ad Gal.
good tree yields good fruits: and the evil tree yields evil fruits,
therefore by their fruits you shall know them. Which fruits also do bring
this commodity, that a christian man be furnished and confirmed, as it were,
with a certain spiritual armor, against the works of the flesh. For the rule
of the Apostle will never fail: Walk in the Gal. 3, c
spirit, and the works of the flesh you shall not accomplish: And in an other
place it is written: If by the To. 8, c
spirit, you mortify the deeds of the flesh; you shall live.

4 Which are the works of the flesh?

THose, whereof the Apostle thus discourses: Gal. 5, c d vide Aug. li. 14. de
ciuit. Dei, cap. 2. and 3.
The works of the flesh be manifest, which are, Fornication, Uncleanness,
Impudicity, Leacherie, serving of Idols, Witchrafts, Enmities, Contentions,
Emulations, Angers, Brawelles, dissentions, Sects, Enuies, Murders, Ebrieties,
Commessations, and such like. Which I foretell you as I have foretold you,
that they which do such things, shall not obtain the kingdom of Heaven. And
afterward he adds in the same place: And they Ibid. d
that be Christ's, have crucified their flesh, with the vices and
concupiscences. Then in another place: They Romans 8, b Aug. de ver. Apost. ser.
6. cap. 9. and 11.
that are in flesh, (to wit they that walk acording to the desires of the
flesh) cannot please God. Therefore the same Apostle gives this admonition:
Be not Gal. 6, b
deceived, God is not mocked. For what things a man shall sow, those also
shall he reap. For he that sows in his flesh, of the flesh also shall
reap corruption, but he that sows in the Spirit, of the Spirit shall reap
life everlasting.

OF THE EIGHT BEATITVDES.
1 Which are the Beatitudes of the Law of the Gospel?

which Saint AMBROSE calls Amb. in 6. cap. Luc.
our Lords Beatitudes and Benedictions, which in Mat. 5, a and ibidem.
Hilarious, Chrysostomus, Hieronymus, Chromatius. Theoph. Euthym. Anselm. etc.
S. MATTHEW'S Gospel are in this manner recounted eight in number.

1 Blessed are the Luc. 6, c Esa. 66, a Iac. 2, a Mat. 18, a
poor in spirit: For theirs is the kingdom of Heaven.

2 Blessed are the Psa. 36, b Mat. 11, d Psalm. 26, d
meek: for they shall possess the Land.

3 Blessed are they that Luc. 6, c 16, f 1. Reg. 15, g Io. 16, c Esa. 61, a
Mat. 26, g
mourn: for they shall be comforted.

4 Blessed are they that Sap. 1, a Psalm. 15, b 61 d Esa. 65, b
hunger and thirste after Justice: for they shall have their fill.

5 Blessed are the Psalm. 40, a Pro. 11, c Eccli. 29, b. Luc. 6, c
merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.

6 Blessed are the Ps. 23, a Psalm. 50, c
clean of heart: for they shall see God.

7 Blessed are the Ps. 36, d Joan. 14, d
peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of god.

8 Blessed are they that Luc. 6, c. 1. Pet. 3, c 2. Tim. 3, c Act. 14, d Aug.
de ser. Do. in monte, l. 1. cap. 5.
suffer persecution for Justice: for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven.

11 Why is this doctrine of the Beatitudes to be observed?

BEcause it is the chiefest and greatest part of the Law of the Gospel which
Christ our Esa. 53, d Iac. 4, c Mat. 5, a
lawmakers delivered upon the Hill with his own most sacred mouth, that every
man might consider what is contained and required in Christian Justice besides
Faith: then also that they might understand, how unto just persons a crown
of Justice, as Saint PAVL 2. Tim. 4, b
calls it, or a full, and 2. Io. ep. c Luc. 6, c
eternal reward does not come without 1. Cor. 3, b Mat. 11, b Luc. 16, d
labor. For hereupon does S. JAMES also affirm. Blessed is Iac. 1, b
the man that suffers temptation: For when he has been proved, he shall
receive the crown of life.

3 And what is principally to be noted about the doctrine of the Beatitudes?

FIrst of all certes ought to be observed, Amb. in 6. cap. Luc.
that there be certain distinct degrees amongst them, as appears both by
their number, and order. Then, in every degree there are jointly proposed two
things: whereof the one is the very act of virtue, or the merit and the
Beatitude (as they call it) of this life: the other is the reward of life
everlasting, aunswerable to his proper and peculiar merit, which we may call
the Beatitude of our country. And as the first part offers labor and
difficulty to the believers: so the latter, which in each degree is presently
adioined; by the greatness of the proposed reward, does afford consolation,
and eases the labors, sweates, and agonies which every man must sustain in
Christian warfare. For no man 2. Tim. 2, a
shall be crowned unless he strive lawefully. Every one 1. Cor. 3, b
shall receive his own reward, according to his own labor. What things Gal.
6, b
a man shall sow, those also shall he reap, as constantly affirms the
doctor of the Gentiles. And therefore our Lord before he come to sit in Heb.
10, e g Act. 17, g
dreadful judgment over the world, stirs us to the expectation of his
coming with these words: Behold I Apoc. 22, c
come quickly says he, and my reward is with me, to render to every man
according to his works. He that Apoc. 3, d Mat. 19, d. Luc. 22, c.
shall overcome I will give unto him to sit with me in my throne: which
finally is the most high, eternal, and absolute beatitude and happiness.

But most Eccles. 2, a b 5, c 11, c d Ps. 143, c d Sap. 2, a b
vain is the judgment of the world, touching beatitude and happiness: by
which in the mean season many are deceived and brought to destruction. For
commonly and for the most part are accounted happy, the rich and the mighty,
those that excel in glory and authority, those which abound with the goods of
fortune, those which give themselves wholly to pleasure. But Christ lays a
double woe Luc. 6, d Esa. 5 b c d 65, b c Amos. 6, a b
upon those men. And boldly thus Esa. 3, c
does ESAIE cry out: My people, they that call thee happy, they deceive thee,
and bring to naught the way of thy footesteptes. Ps. 143, d 32, c et ibid. Aug.
conc. 2 and in Ps 118 concione. 1.
Blessed is the people to whom our Lord is God: to wit: that in living well and
happily, he may always praise and magnify his auctour and creator.

OF THE EVANGELICALL COVNCELLS.
1 Which are called the Evangelical Counsels?

THose Aug. ser. 65 de temp. and in ench. c. 121. Item l. 1. de adult. coniug.
c. 14 and l. de sanct Virg. ca. 14. Item. l. 2. q. Euang. c. 19. et Paulin. ad
Seueru^. ep. 4
surely, which though they be not absolutely necessary for the getting of
salvation: yet to the intent that we may have a more ready and easy way to
procure the same, they are proposed and counseled by our Savior Christ.

For which cause, the difference that the Scripture has set down between
Precepts 1. Cor. 7, d Mat. 19, c 16, d Luc. 19, f
and Counsels, is very diligently to be noted: that we may understand, that
the first are prescribed, as necessary to be observed: but the other are
counseled and voluntarily 1. Cor. 9, b c Mat. 26. a Mar. 14. a 3. Reg. 8, b
Genesis 8, d Number. 6, a
undertaken, as furtherances of the perfitte observation of the commandments.
Hereupon the Apostle, when he would give instruction about the leading of a
single life, pronounces this sentence: As concerning 1. Cor. 7, d Cypr. in
ser. de not. Chri.
Virgins, a commandment of our Lord I have not: but counsel I give as having
obtained mercy of our Lord to be faithful. And to this end is that which S.
AUGUSTINE has plainly said: A Counsel is Sermon. 61. de temp.
one thing, a Commandment is an other. Counsel is given to conserve
Virginity, to abstain from wine and flesh, to sell all that we have, and to
give it to the pore: but there is commandment given, to keep Justice, to
turn from evil, and to do good. And again: He that shall willingly hear,
and fulfill a Ibidem.
counsel, shall have the greater glory: He that shall not fulfill a
commandment, unless he be helped by penance, he cannot possibly avoid
punishment. Unto S. AUGUSTINE consents S. AMBROSE, when as he writes thus:
That is not commanded Amb. ep. 21. ad Eccles Vercellens. vide cund. in lib. de
viduis.
which is above the law, but is rather persuaded by a counsel being given:
and that which is the safer is showed unto us. Also: Counsel inuiteth them
that are willing: the Commandment, binds even them that are unwilling. And
of the same mind was S. HIEROME, as these his words do declare: Lib. 1. aduers.
Iouin. cap. 7.
Where counsel is given, there is the free choice of the offerer. Where a
commandment is given: there is necessity of a servant. But that deserves a
greater reward, says he, which is Ep. 22. ad Eustoch. de Virg. cust. cap. 8.
not constrained and yet is offered.

2 How many Euangelecall Counsels are there?

TO Recounte them all in this place, it is not needful: but there are three
principal, of embracing and professing Poverty, Chastity, and Obedience; as
the Fathers have gathered out of holy scripture. Poverty Mat. 19, c d ^, Act.
4. g Vide vitam S. Marci, Cypriani, Anthonij, Hilarionis, Chrysostom. Paulini,
Augustini, Gregorij, Iosaphat, cap. 35. Damascen^* etc.
appertains to those that once do forsake al worldly things, that after the
example of S. PETER and the Apostles, they may perfectly follow Christ.
Chastity Mat. 19. b Eusebius. l 2. hist. c. 6 and Nyceph. l. 2. cap. 16. ex
Philo^e de vita conte^platiua.
belongs to those that have cut themselves for the Kingdom of heaven. And
as TERTVLIAN has Lib. 1. ad vxorem. c. 6.
said, do show themselves voluntary Eunuchs. And they do perform
obedience, who, to the intent they may fully deny themselves; Mat. 16. d Luc.
^, c.
are not only utterly auerted from all cupidities, but also from their own will
as the scripture Eccli. 18, d Gal. 5, e Bas. in regulis breuior^bus quaestione
96.
admonishes: whilst they do wholly submit themselves unto his will, whom in
the steed of Christ they have chosen to be their superior.

Such kind of Counsels, Christ the absolute example of Evangelical
perfection, has not only taught in word, as we will presently show: but has
also confirmed the same unto us, by the example of his most holy life: who,
when he was rich, 2. Cor. 8, b
for our sakes became poor, not having where Mat. 8, c
to lay his head: who Esa. 7, c
borne of a Virgin, perseuereth a Virgin, and the Hier. ep. 22. ad Eustoch. c.
1. and 6. Amb. lib 1. de Virg. and ser. 90.
spouse of all most holy virgins: who finally was so diligent in exhibiting
obedience, that being subject to his Luc. 2, g Mat. 17, d
mother a Virgin, yea and that which is more unto a Carpenter, and being
obedient even to Phil. 2, b Mat. 26, d Romans 5, d
the death of the Cross: he witnesses of him self: I descended Io. 6, d 4, c
5, c
from heaven not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.

3 In what place is Evangelical poverty taught by Christ?

IN S. MATTHEW'S Mat. 19, c
Gospel, it is declared in that place which follows the rehearsal of the
divine precepts: Of which precepts it is said to every one with out
exception: If thou will enter into life keep the commandementes. And then
after is the counsel proposed of undertaking Hier. ep. ^ ad Helled c. ^litem
in ^^ 19. Mat. and ad Deem triad. de serua^d. virg. epist. 8. c. 7. quaest. 1.
ad Hedib. epist. 150. and ad Pammachium, super obitu Paulinae. ep. 26. c. 3.
and 4. Bas. quaest. 9. in regulis fusius disputatis. Damasc. in hist. Barlaam
and Iosaphat. cap. 1^. Chrysostom. in illud Pauli, Salutate Prisc. and Aquilam.
voluntary poverty, with a particular form of words annexed, which might
leave it to the free will of him which choseth the same. For our Lord says: IF
THOU WILL Ibidem. Luc. 18, c Marc. 10, d and ibidem Bed^ and Theophylact.
be perfect, go sell the things that thou have and give to the poor and thou
shall have treasure in heaven, and come follow me. Where our Lord does not only
give this counsel: but adds also as it were a spur, and to the intent
that men might be more willing to embrace this counsel, he proposes the
greatness of reward whereby he may allure and comfort them: promising that so
it shall come to pass, that he which by leauinge all for Christ's sake is
poor: shall have a treasure in heaven, shall receive a hundred fold, Mat. 19,
d and ibidem Hieronym. Euthymius. and Anselm. item Theophylact. and Beda, in
Mar. and Luc Cassiancollat. 24. c. 26. Greg. ho. 18. in Ezech. Bern. in

and possess life everlasting, which otherwise is very Mat. 19, c
hard for rich men to come unto.

Such Luc. 6, c and ibid. Amb. Leo. in ser. de omnibus Sanctis. Chromat. in c^.

poverty, were the Apostles in whose name S. PETER said boldly unto Christ:
Behold Mat. 19, d
we have left all things, and have followed thee.

Of this number also, were the Christians of the Primative Church who as Act.
4. g 2. g Hier. epist. 8. ad Deem. c. 7. and in catal viror. illust. de Marco.

and collat. 3. c. 6.
S. LVKE testifies, did sell their possessions, and applied the money that came
thereby, to the common use: so that no man called any thing his own, because
nothing was private, but al things remained common amongst them.

But this poverty requires that it be a voluntary and full resignation of
Riches, whereof, no Act. 5, a Hier. epist. 8. ad Demetr. cap. 7. Bas. ser. 1.
de instit. Monach. and in co^stit. Monast. cap. 19. and 35. Item quaest. 85. in

propriety may be retained.

And here takes place that famous Genna. de Eccles. Dogmat. cap. 71. Amb. 1.

sentence approved by the ancient Fathers: It is good by portions to give a
man's substance to the poor: but it is better to give all at once with an
intent to follow our Lord, and being free from care, to be poor with
Christ.

4 Where is the Council of Chastity commended?

BOth in the Gospelles, and in the Apostles writings. For Christ commends
those Mat. 19, b. Esa 56, b and ibide^. Hier. item lib. 1. adu. Iouin. cap. 7.
Bas. de Virginit. Epiphan. haeres. 58. cont. Valesios. Aug. de Sa^cta Virginit
ca. 24. and 25.
kinds of Eunuchs, that have gelded themselves for the kingdom of heaven.
And least we should think that this is rather a Commandment, than a
Counsel; he adds presently; He that can take it, let him take it. In which
speech our Lord does as it were exhort, (as well does S. HIEROME Hier. in c.
19. Mat. and l. 1. adu. Iouin. cap. 7 Cyp. in tract de discipline. and habitu
Virginum.
interpret) and inuit his soldiers to the reward of Chastity; as if he
said: He that can fight let him fight: let him conquer and triumph. This ca^
he do, unto who^ it is Sap. 8, d
given: and it is given to all (as witnesses the same Ibid. and Orig. tract. 7
in Mat. Aug. lib. 6. Conf. c. 11. Chrysostom. hom. 63. in Mat. Nazian. in ^rat. 31.
holy father) that will ask: that will desire: that will labor for to
receive. For to every one that asks, it shall be Mat. 7, ^ Luc. 11, b Trid.
ses. 24. can. 9.
given, and he that seeks, shall find, and to him that knocks, it shall be
opened. Thus says S. HIEROME.

And to this Chastity, holy Sap. 3, c 4, a Eccli. 26, c Mat. 13, a c 22, c Mar.
12, c Luc. 20, f
Scripture assigns certes a reward: but to the Chastity of Virgins; it
promises a particular and singular reward. For they that Apoc. 14, a Esa. 56,
b Psalm. 44. c d Cyr. catech. 4. 12. and 15. illum. Martial. in ep. ad Tolosan.
c. 8. 9. and 10. Cypr. in tract. de discipline. and habitu Virginum. Hier. in
epist. ad Philem. Aug. in lib. de sancta Virginitate cap 14. 27. and seque^^.
Greg. in 3. part curae pastor. admonit. 29.
have not been defiled with weemen, but have remained Virgins: do stand
without spotte before the throne of God, and do singe a new Song before God
and the Lamb, and do follow the Lamb whither-soeuer he shall go.

And the Apostle has said expressly: It is 1. Cor. 7, a
good for a man not to touch a woman. And again, as concerning Ibidem, e vide
Hier. l. 1 adu. Iouin. c. 4. and seq. Amb. in 1. Cor. 7. and ibid. Theod Ite^
cund. in ep. divine. decret. cap. de Virginit. Chry. in lib. de Virginit. c. 9.
and seq.
Virgins: A Commandment of our Lord I have not, but Council I give, as having
obtained mercy of our Lord to be faithful. I think therefore that this is
good for the present necessity, because it is good for a man so to do. And
again writing of the widdowe: Let her Ibid. g Iudit. 8, a 15, c Luc. 2, e
marry (says he) to whom she will: only in our Lord: but more blessed shall
she be, if she so remain according to my counsel. And I think that I also
have the spirit of God.

Unto the Apostle very finely accords S. AMBROSE, Ambr. in epist. 83. ad
Syricium Papam and 82. ad Vercellenses.
when he writes in these words: Justly certes is the good wife commended, but
more rightly is the devout Virgin preferred, the Apostle saying: He that

his virgin in matrimony, does well: and he that ioineth not, does better: for
the one thinks of the things that be of God; the other of the things that
be of the World: the one, is bound with the bands of Wedlock; the other is
free from bands: the one, is under the Law; the other, under grace. Good is
Marriage, by means whereof there has bin found posterity of humane
succession: but better is Virginity, whereby has been atchiued the
inheritance of the heavenly kingdom, and the succession of heavenly merits
has been found. By a Woman came care, by a Virgin was procured salvation.
Hitherto S. AMBROSE.

Now this Chastity requires, that a man do with deliberation Bas. in
Praefat. in Ascetica and in constitutionibus Monasticis. cap. 1. Cassian.
collat. 12 cap. 4. and 7.
and firm purpose, endeavor to live uncorrupted and to lead a perpetual
single life, void of all filthe of the flesh, or venereous voluptuousness:
that he may be holy both in 1. Cor. 7. f
body and spirit for Christ's sake. And in regard hereof the Apostle has
said: He that 1. Cor. 7, g Bas. ho. in Psalm. 44.
has determined in his heart, being settled, not having necessity, but having
power of his own will, and has judged this in his hear, to keep his Virgin:
does well.

5 How is the Euangelical Counsel concerning obedience proposed unto us?

De Obedientiae laud, and perfectione, vide Aug. l. 14. de ciu. Dei. cap. 12.
Hier. epist. 8. ad Demetr. cap. 10. Greg. lib. 35 moral. c. 12. Item in 1. Reg.

collat. 2 cap. 11. and collat. 4 cap. 20. Bern. in sermon. de 3. ordinibus
Ecclesiae, item ad milites templi cap. 13. and in sermon. de virtute Obedient.
CHrist our Lord, first by the example of his most holy life, as we said
before: then by his word, has proposed and commended unto us the exact and
perfect manner of this obedience. For he came not to do Joan. 6, d 4, c 5, c
his own will but the will of his Father, and of those unto whom we read Luc.
1, g. Bern ser. 3. de Cicumcis. Domini.
that he was subject: he came, to Mat. 20, d Luc. 22, c
serve, and not to be served, in so much that he humbled himself being made
obedient even to death, Phil. 2, b
even the death of the Cross.

Then by word also moving us to his imitation, he said: Mat. 16, d Luc. 9, c.
Hieron. ad Rusticum Monach. ep. 4. c. 6. et 7 Bas. in ser. de abdicatione
rerum, and ser. de instit. Monach. and quaest. 96. in regulis breuioribus. Item
in co^stitutionibus Monastici^. c. 23. Greg. lib. 32. moral. c. 21. Niceph. l.
1^ Eccles. ^nst. cap. 37.
If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his Cross,
and follow me. Which words may be certes, very well understood, as spoken
generally to all: but yet after a more peculiar and perfect manner, they do
belong unto those; who, so far as their frailty can reach, do so conform
themselves unto Christ: that they will not in any one thing be governed by
themselves: and do endeavor to live rather at an other man's direction, then at
their own; whilst they do follow of their own accord the will and
commandment of an other, whom they have made their governor in Christ's room.

The superior of such persons, as teaches S. BASIL, Bas. in co^stitutionibus
Mon^st cap. 23. 1. Reg. 15, c Eccles. 4, d Luc. 10. c Ephesians. 6, a Coloss. 3. d
does bear the person of Christ, and being made as it were an intercessour
between God and me^; does Sacrifice unto God, the salvation of them that obey.
And therefore as sheep do obey their Shepehearde, going the same way that the
Shepehearde leads them: so is it meet that such practisers of piety, do
obey their superiors: not curiously searching the things that are commanded,
so that they be free from sin: But with all alacrity and diligence,
fulfilling those things that are prescribed: And of this Superior, after S.
BASIL S. BERNARD Bern. in tract. de praecepto and dispensatione cap. 12. 13.
and 23, vide cund. in ep. 2. ad Adam Monachu^.
also affirms: him whom we have in Gods rome; we ought to hear as God
himself, in those things, which are not manifestly against God.

faithful and excelent followers of Christ, as have busily attended to the
observation of the said counsels; the Church has always had: as ancient
histories do make mention: and amongst them certain choice and approved
companies of devout and religious men, who above the custom and example of the
common sort, forsaking at once all their goods, and abandoninge the pleasures
of the flesh, have given them selves by profession to a holy obedience: only
seeking and laboring that they might wholly conform themselves to the example
of the obediente Christ, and to the perfection of the Evangelical rule;
leaving no place at all to their own proper will. Witnesses whereof very fit
and substantial, we have S. BASIL, S. AUGUSTINE, S. HIEROME, S. BENEDICT, S.
GREGORY, CASSIANVS, S. BERNARD, and others innumerable professors of
Evangelical perfection, and not only defendours, but most perfect obseruers of
a monastical rule.

6 In brief; what conceipte ought we to have, of the Evangelical Counsels?

THis surely, that they be prouocations and certain helps very profitable,
which do yield armor unto weak persons against the 1. Io. 2, c Luc. 14, de f
g 8, b Mat. 19, b c 13, c 1 Cor. 7, f Eccli. 31, a Pro. 29, c Iudic. 17, c 21,
d Gal. 5, b
baits of the world, and the flesh: which do further the endeavors of good
men in the race of true piety: which do make the Spirit more at liberty to
perform the functions of religion and divine worship: and which moreover are
much available, as we have declared, for the atchiuing of the reward of
eternal life, and more ample glory Mat. 19, b c d Greg. lib. 26. moral. c. 25.
in the kingdom of heaven.

But the whole sum of Evangelical perfection stands in this; that as much
as thou may thou endeavor to get 1. Cor. 13, a 1 Io. 2, a 4, c Col. 3, c
Aug. de morib. Eccles. Cathol. c. 33
charity; and that thou follow Luc. 9, c
Christ. And him thou do imitate; if, according to thy power, thou do
seek to conform thy self to Christ, who was both 2. Cor. 8, b Mat. 8, c
poor and a 1. Pet. 1, e
Virgin, and subject Luc. 2, g
to others, and obedient Phil. 2, b

neglecting those things that are behind, 1. Pet. 2, d
with unwearied labor thou do travail toward those things that are
before, and do stretch out thy self every day to the price of the supernal
vocation, utterly forsaking in the mean season, as much as thou can, thy own
proper will, and submitting it to a man for gods sake, that thou may 1. Cor.
12, d
pursue the better gifts, and may both choose Luc. 10, g
the best-parte, and with faithfulness conserve the same even to the Apo. 2, c
end.

OF THE FOUR LAST THINGS OF A MAN.
1 Which are called the four last things of a man?

THese surely: Death, Judgment, Hell, and the Kingdom of heaven: called
certes the last Eccli. 7, d 28, a 38, b Deuteronomy. 32, d Pro. 19, c Bern. in ser. de
primord. medijs and nouissunis.
things, because that amongst all the things that can chance unto a man, they
challenge unto themselves the very last place. For death, according to the
common saying, is the last line of things. After Death follows the Judgment
of God, as S. PAVL also has declared in these words: It is Heb. 9. g
appointed to men to die once, and after this, the Judgment. To wit both that

particular which every one has at his death; and that last and general
Judgment, which expects all men at the end of the world, as we have already

declared.

And some are judged, (those that die in mortal sin) to be delivered to
everlasting Luc. 16, c Mat. 25, d
pains in Hell: others, who departing this life, are adorned with the marriage

garment of charity; that they may enjoy the most happy life in the kingdom
of heaven. That is it which the Evangelical verity affirms; They Io. 5, c
Mat. 25, d
that have done good things, shall come forth into the resurrection of life,
but they that have done evil into the resurrection of judgment. For Mat. 16, d
the son of man shall come in the glory of his Father, with his Angels: and
then will he render to every man according to his works.

2 What instruction does the scripture give us of death?

AS, To. 5, b Sap. 1, d Council. Mileuit. cap. 1. Aug. de praedest. and gratia.
cap. 3.
by one man sin entered into this world, and by sin death: and so unto all
men death did pass as S. PAVL affirms. Therefore although nothing be more
uncertain unto us then Greg. ho. 13: in Eua^g. Aug. in Ps. 144. ho. 27. ex 50.
cap 3. and cap 2. soliloquioru^ animae. Hugo. Vict. lib. 1. de anima cap. 3.
the hour of death, for a man knows Eccles. 9, c Iac 4, d Eccli 11, c 14, b
Luc. 12, c
not his end: yet nothing can be more sure tha^ death it self. For which cause
it is written: All 2 Reg. 14. c Eccles. 2. c Ps. 89, b 101 a b 102, c Job. 8, b
14. a 1 Pet. 1. d Aug. lib. 13. de ciu. Dei cap. 10. and 11. ser 21. de verbis

of us die, and as waters we fall into earth, which do not return again. And
Ecclesiasticus confirming the same. And Eccli. 10, b Job 17, d Psalm. 18, b d*
Baruch 3, b Eccli. 41, a Aug. senten. vlt. apud Prosp
a King (says he,) is to day, and to morrow he shall die; and when a man dies,
he shall inherit serpents, and beasts, and worms.

And because it concerns us much, in what manner, and how well prepared we
die: therefore so often in the Gospel is this repeated unto us: Be Mat 25, a
20. d Mar. 13, d Aug. ep. 80. ad Hesych. and quaest. 59. lib. 83. quaestionum.
watchful: Also, be ye ready: Luc. 12, c

And we shall be watchful and ready to entertain death, if every man do for
his own part, earnestly and in all his life meditate that which is written:

in Joan.
night comes when no man can work: Joan. 12, c Luc. 19, c
walk whilst you have the light, that the darkness overtake you not.

But fittely does the Prophet put a difference between the death of the good
and the evil. For of these he says: The death Psalm. 33, d Pro. 11, a Sap. 5,

of sinners is very evil. To wit, of them, who like the obstinate Jews do
die in their sin without penance, and for that cause do so perish that they
are to be tormented perpetually Luc. 16, c f Greg. 4 dial cap. 38. and hom. 12.

such this death of the body is nothing else, but an end of this earthly
peregrination, and a conclusion of the miseries of this mortal life, a quiet
sleep and a secure repose, the beginning of true life, and a wished passage to
most happy immortality: with the desire whereof the Apostle burning, and
being weary of this life: Phil. 1, d Luc. 2, d Psalm. 41, a 83, a 141, b Number.
23, b
I desire says he, to be dissolved and to be with Christ. Luc. 12, c
Blessed are those servants that when the Lord comes he shall find
watching. And blessed Apoc. 14, c
are the dead which die in our Lord. And Sap. 4, b
a just man if he shall be prevented with death, he shall be in a refreshing.

3 In what sort does holy scripture admonish us of Judgment?

IT is horrible to Heb. 10, f Bern. ser. 8. in Psalm. Qui habitat.

things that are done God will bring into judgment, for every fault: whether
it be good or evil. And therefore not only unto sinners, but also unto 1.

cap. 13.
Saints oftentimes the expectation Heb. 10, c
of this judgment is terrible. This did holy DAVID fear, so that he did
earnestly pray: Enter not Psalm. 142, a
into judgment with thy servant O Lord. This feared JOB also notwithstanding
he was innocent, Job. 1, a
and his fear he expresses in these words: Job. 31, b
What shall I do when God shall arise to judgment? And when he shall ask, what
shall I answer him? as swelling waves Ibidem c Greg. 21. moral. cap. 15. and 16.

did fear al Job. 9, d 24, b Eccles 9, a 1. Cor. 4, a

to be feared, whose power we cannot escape, whose wisdom is infallible,
Justice inflexible, Judgment vnreuocable. Of which it is thus written: The
Zeal Pro. 6, d
and furor of the Man (to wit, of Christ the Judge) shall not spare in the
day of revenge, nor yield to any man's petition, nor will take for redemption
never so many gifts. Who also of himself and his judgment (least any man
should be ignorant) has foretold this unto all men. When Ps 74, a Bern. ser.
55. in Cant.
I shall take time, I will judge justice. I the Lord Hier 17, b 11, d 20, c 32,

but the Elements shall be resolved with heat, and the earth, and the works

dissolved: what manner of men ought you to be in holy conuersations and
godlinesses, expecting and hasting unto the coming of the day of our Lord, by
which the heavens burning shall be resolved, and the Elements shall melt with
the heat of fire.

And that we may find Christ then a gentle Judge, and that day wherein

AS nothing is more miserable than death, as nothing also is more terrible than
judgment, espeaciallie to the children of this world persisting obstinately
in sin: so can there nothing be imagined more intolerable and unfortunate,
than hell and the pain thereof. For there (as witnesses divine Mat. 8, b 13,

scripture) is weeping and gnashing of teeth: there their worm Mar. 9, g Esa.

because of the contrition of spirit, ye shall houle. Therefore the Kingly
Prophet calls upon all Kings and Princes, and sets before them the pains
that are to come for the wicked; with this severe admnnition: And now Psalm. 2, c

you do perish from the just way, when his anger shall suddenly wax hoate.

GOd has prepared Mat. 25, c

that does the will of my Father which is in heaven, he shall enter into the
kingdom of heaven. This is a holy city, and it also requires holy citizens,
there shall not enter Apoc. 21, g

6 What is the use and commodity of the wholle doctrine concerning the four
last things?

Vide Chrysostom. epist. 5. ad Theod. lapsum and Damasc. in hist Barlaam and
Iosaphat ca. 5. 12. 13. 14.
FIrst of all, to know, and seriously to meditate these things; it is
profitable to this end: that we may the more easily be withdrawn from the
care, affection, and love of those things which are transitory, vain, and
floating in this world. For Eccles. 1, a and ibidem Hier. item Greg. lib. 5.
c. 2. in 1. Reg
vanity of vanities says Ecclesiastes: Vanity of vanities, and all is
vanity. I saw Ibid. c
all things that are done under the sun, and behold all is vanity and
affliction of spirit.

Then they do not only, being well considered, auerte a man from vain
cogitations and earthly cares; but also do terrify him from all Aug lib. 2.
de Genesi cont. Many cap. 28. and sermon. 120. de temp. Greg. hom. 39. in Euang.
Isid. lib. 3. de summo bono cap. vlt.
liberty, custom and pronesse to sin. Hence is that golden sentence: In
Eccli. 7, d Bern. ser. 1. in festo omniu^ Sanctorum item in sermon. de primordijs
me dijs. and nouissimis nostris.
all thy works remember thy last things, and thou shall never sin.

Moreover they do admonish a wise man, that in all affairs, he do no thing
rashly, but that first he set Deuteronomy. 32, d
before himself the last things, and having foreseen the end, do go on in
the high rode way, that he may neither decline on the right Pro. 4, d
hand, or on the left, from that which is right.

But speacially the memory and contemplacion of such things does cause, that
the fear of God which is the fountain of true Eccli. 1, b Psalm. 110, b Pro.
1, a 9, b Job. 28, d Eccles. 7, c Pro. 14, c Chry. ho. 15 ad pop. Ant ite^ ho.
2. in 2. ad These. Aug tract. 9 in ep. Io. and in Psalm. 127.
wisdom the guardian of all virtue, and a necessary scholemaster in all the
life of man: may confirm and set us forewarde in the zeal of Justice and
goodness. For Eccli. 1, c
the fear of God expels sin: And he that is without fear cannot be
justified. They Eccli. 2, d Aug. ser. 13. c. 13. and 18. c. 8. de verb. Apost.
ite^ l. de Sancta Virg. cap 38 and sermon. 214 de temp.
that fear our Lord will enquire what things are well pleasing unto him, they
will prepare their hearts, and in his sight they will sanctify their souls.
Finally, they Ibidem.
that fear our Lord, will keep his commandementes, and will have patience
until he behold them, saying: If we do not Penance we shall fall into the
hands of our Lord.

But the children of this world, who love Psalm. 4, a
vanity and seek after a lie: who Pro. 2, c
reioise when they do evil and triumph in things that be worst, before whose
Ps. 13, b
eyes the fear of God is not: they do nothing less, then think of these
matters. It is a Deuteronomy. 32, d Bern. ser. 2. in die Apost Petri and Pauli, item
epist 292.
people without counsel, and without wisdom: would to God they were wise,
and did understand, and foresee the last things. With them we see it fall out
daiely by experience, that which holy JOB says: They hold Job. 21, b
the Taber and the Lute, and rejoice at the sound of the instrument. They
pass over their days in pleasures, and in a moment they descend into hell. So
Pro. 14, b
laughter shall be mingled with grief, and the end of joy is mourning.

7 What is the Sum of those things that are contained in this book?

THe sum of the whole work is comprised in two things: in Christian
wisdom, and justice. To wisdom are these points referred: to wit; of Faith,
and the Creed; of Hope, and our Lords Prayer; of Charity, and the ten
Commandments. For Faith, Hope and Charity, are those virtues, wherein the
divine scripture co^prehendeth the true wisdom of man, as Saint AUGUSTINE Lib.
2 retract. cap. 63 and in Ench. cap. 2. and 3.
has noted. Then is there further annexed a discourse of the Precepts of the
Church, and of the Sacraments. For as the foresaid virtues cannot stand
without the Sacraments, and perfect observance of the Precepts of the
Church: so, being joined with the^, they are effectually grafted in us; and
being grafted, are confirmed, augmented and brought to perfection. Therefore in
explicating those things which we reduce unto wisdom, is the first part of the
book concluded.

The latter which treats of Justice, does briefly demonstrate two parts
thereof, belonging both to the fleeing Psalm. 33, c 36, c
of evil things, and the pursueing of those which are good. For to abstain
from evil (as witnesses S. CHRYSOSTOM) Chrysostom. in Psalm. 4. plura vide supra.
page 269.
is not sufficient for us to salvation, except therewithal be annexed the
following of good things, and the action of virtue. Therefore to either of
these two parts, we have applied some discourses, which do chiefelie serve to
the observing of the difference of good and evil. But the force and largenes
of all justice, TOBIE a man no less wise then just, does briefly comprehend:
where he admonishes his son and consequently in him all the children of God
in particular, with these words. Tob. 4, ^
Fear not my son; we lead surely a poor life, but we shall have many good
things if we fear God, and abstain from all sin, and do well. Thus
finally we learn the exact duty of a christian man, which does not only
require faith, but a life also ordered according to the rule of Christian
wisdom and justice. For a wise heart that has understanding, as the scripture
testifies, Eccli. 3, d
will keep it self from sin, and will have success in the works of
Justice.

But to the intent that we may not pass the bands of our intended brevity,
let this be the end and conclusion of this Doctrine appertaining to the
instruction of Christians, and those especially of the simpler sort. All which
things we will close up with one word of Ecclesiastes, as with a notable
seal of the whole life of man, making this conclusion: Eccles. 12, d
Fear God, and keep his Commandments: For this, is all a man.

forces of humane nature, nor by any other remedy than by the merit of one
Mediator, 1. Tim. 2, b
our Lord Jesus Christ; who has reconciled us To. 5, b Petrus Diaconus de

is applied as well to those of discretion, as to Infants by the Sacrament of

is no other name Act. 4, b
under heaven given unto me^, in which we must be saved. And hence is that
speech: Io* 1, d
Behold the Lamb of God, behold him that takes away the sin of the world.
And this also. Gal. 3, d Aug. lib. 6. cont. Iul. c. 4
As many of you as are Baptized in Christ, have put on Christ.

They therefore do pernitiously err, who deny that Infants Council. Mileuit.
c. 2. Aphr. can. 77.
newely borne ought to be Baptized: although they be borne of Baptized
Parents. For these also are Baptized into remission of sins, as having
received Original sin from ADAM, which must of necessity be purged by the
Aug. lib. 1. de peccat. mer. cap. 16. lib. 4. cont. 2. ep. Pelag. c. 4
Lauer of regeneration, for the getting of life everlasting: because no
otherwise; is this to be understood, To. 5, b Aug. lib. 4. cont. 2. ep. Pelag.
cap. 4. lib. 2. cont. Pelagium and Coelest. cap. 40.
By one man sin entered into the world, and by sin death: and so unto all
men death did pass, in which all sinned: But as the Catholic Church all the
world over has allwaies understood it. For because of this rule of faith:
according to the Tradition of the Apostles, even Infants who could not as yet
commit any sin in their own persons, are therefore truly baptized into
remission of sins, that in them by regeneration that may be cleansed, which
they have co^tracted by generation: For Io. 3, ^
unless a man be borne again of water and the spirit, he cannot enter into
the kingdom of God.

4 Of the relikes of original sin in the Baptized.

Moreover we ought to acknowledge, that the guilt of original sin is
remitted, by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ which is given in baptism: and
that in the baptized Aug. lib. 1. cont. 2. ep. Pelag c. 13. 14. l. 6. cont.
Iulia. cap. 13 and seq, lib. 2. cont. Pelag. and Coelest. c. 39. and 40. See
the 3. question of Baptism page. 151
all that which has in it the true and proper nature of sin, is quite taken
away, and not rased only, or not imputed. For in the regenerate God hates
nothing, bccause there To. 8, a
is no damnation unto them, that are truly Ibid. 6, a
buried with Christ by baptism unto death: That walk not according to the
flesh, but putting Ephesians. 4, c Col. 3, b
off the old man, and putting on the new which is created according to God,
are made innocent, immaculate, pure, void of sin, and dear unto Almighty
God: To. 8, c
Heirs certes of God, and coheires of CHRIST, so that nothing at all may stay
them from entering into heaven. And yet notwithstanding must we confess, that
there remains in the baptized Aug. lib. 2. de peccat. mer. cap. 28.
concupiscence: which being left Idem lib. 2. cont. Iul. cap. 9. and 10. lib.
1. de pec. mer. c. vlt.
to strive withal, cannot possibly hurt them that do not consent, and that
do Idem. l. 1. ciu. c. 25. lib. 5. con. Iul. cap. 3.
by the grace of Christ courageously resist: yea rather 2. Tim. 2, a
he that shall strive lawfully, shall be crowned. This Concupiscence which the
Apostle sometime To. 7, b
calls sin, the Catholic Church never understood, therefore to be called
sin because it is truly and properly sin in the regenerate: but because it
Aug. lib. 6. con. Iul. c. 25. ser. 6. de verb. Apost. cap. 1.
proceeds of sin, and inclines to sin.

5 Of the imbecillitie of nature and the law to Justify Men.

TO come now somewhat nearer to the right and plain understanding of the
Doctrine of Justification, every man must acknowledge and confess thus much,
that when all men by ADAMS transgression had lost Innocence, Coelest. primus
ep. 1. cap. 4. 1. Cor 15. c To. 5, c d
being made unclean, and, as the Apostle says, Ephesians. 2, a

slaves To. 6, c
of sin, and in the power of death, and of the devil: that not only the
Gentiles by the force Prosp co^tra Collat. cap. 22. Aug. ep. 95.

6 Of the dispensation and mystery of the coming of Christ.

Whereby it came to pass that the Heavenly Father, the Father of 2. Cor. 1, a
mercies, and God of all consolation, when that happy Gal. 4, a
fullness of time was come; did send unto men CHRIST JESUS his Son, declared
and promised both before the Law, and in the time of the Law to many holy
Fathers: Both, that he might redeem the Jews who were under the Law; and
that the Gentiles which did To. 9, g
not follow Justice, might apprehend Justice; and all might receive the
adoption of sins. Gal. 4, a
Him has God To. 3, d 5, b 1. Tim. 2, b
proposed as a propitiatour by faith in his blood, for our sins: and not only
1. Io. 2, a
for ours, but for the sins of the whole world.

7 Who are justified by Christ?

But, although he died for 2. Cor. 5, a Prosp cap 9. ad object. Gallor.
all; yet not all do receive the benefit of his death: but those only unto
whom the merit of his Passion is communicated. For as men indeed, except they
were borne as springing from the seed of ADAM, Aug. ep. 89. quaest. 3. lib. 1.
de pec. mer. cap. 28. de natura et gratia, cap. 41. l. 6. cont-Iulia c. 4. 24.
should not be borne unjust, whereas by that propagation, through him, they
contracte, whilst they are conceived, their own proper injustice: so except
they were borne again in Christ, they should never be justified: whereas by
that regeneration, through the merit of his Passion, grace is given them,
whereby they are made just. For this benefit the Col. 3, b
Apostle exhorts us always to give thanks to the Father, who has made us
worthy unto the part of the lot of the Saints in the light: and has
delivered us from the power of darckenesse, and has translated us into the
kingdom of the Son of his love: In whom we have redemption, and the
remission of sins.

8 A description of the Justification of a wicked man, and the manner thereof,
in the state of grace.

IN which words is insinuated the description of a wicked man's justification:
so that it is a translation from that state in the which man is borne the Son
of the first Gal. 4, a Tit. 3, b
ADAM, into the state of grace, and adoption of the Sons of God, by the
second ADAM JESUS CHRIST our Savior. Which translation certes, after the
Gospel once published, cannot be made without the lauer of regeneration, or
the desire thereof, as it is written: Io. 3, a
Unless a man be borne again of water and the spirit, he cannot enter into
the kingdom of God.

9 Of the necessity of preparation to Justification, in those of full age, and
whereof it rises.

FVrthermore, the beginning of Justification it self, in those of full age, is
to be taken as from the Grace Aug. lib. cont. 2. epist Pelag. cap. 9 and 10. de

whereby they are called, without al merit or desert on their part: that they
which were auerted from God by sin, may by his exciting and helping-grace be

unto them: and him they begin to love, as the fountain of all Justice: and
therefore are moved against sin Eccli. 2, d Aug. ho. 50. cap. 2. ex 50. et

with some hatred and detestation, that is to say, by that repentance, which
must be done before Baptism: Finally whilst they purpose to take Baptism,
to begin a new life, and to keep Gods Commandments. Of this disposition it
is written: Heb. 11, b
He that comes to God, must believe, that he is, and is a rewarder to them
that seek him. And Mat. 9, a

remission of sins, but a Sanctification also, and renouation of the inward
man by the voluntary receiving of grace and gifts of the holy Ghost, whereby
a man of unjust, is made just, and of an enemy a friend; that he may be Tit. 3,
b
heir according to the hope of life everlasting. The causes of this
Justification, are these: The final cause, is the glory of GOD, and of CHRIST,
and life everlasting: the efficient cause, is the merciful God, who freely

does wash, and 1. Cor. 6, c
sanctify, signing Ephesians. 1, c
and anointing with the holy spirit of promise, which is the pleadge of our
enheritance: the meritorious cause is, his most beloved only begotten SON,
our Lord JESUS CHRIST, who To. 5, b
when we were enemies, for his Ephesians. 2, a
exceeding Charity with which he loved us, by his most holy Passion upon the
TREE of the CROSS, deserved To. 4, d

Isntrumental cause, is the Sacrament See the 1. question of Baptism page 147.
of BAPTISM, which is the Sacrament of FAITH, without the which no man ever
obtained Justification. Finally the only formal cause, is the Justice of God,
not by which Aug. de spir. and lit. c. 9. 11. in Psalm 150. tract. 26 in Io.

truly Aug. ep. 29. ser. 16. de verb. Apost. l b. 2. retract. c. 13. de spir.

called, and are in very deed just, every one receiving our proper justice in
our selves, according to the measure which the holy Ghost does distribute 1.
Co. 12, b Ephesians. 4, ^ Aug. ep. 57. quaest. 1.
to every one even as he will, and according to every man's proper disposition,
and cooperation.

For although none can be just, but he, to whom the passions of our Lord
JESUS CHRIST are communicated: yet that is done in this justification of a
wicked man, at what time through the merit of the same most holy Passion, by
the Holy Ghost, To. ^* 2. Cor. 1, d Aug. de spir. and lit. cap. 17 32. de not.
and grot. cap. ^^
the Charity of God is powered forth in their hearts that are justified and is
inherent in the^. And therefore in this justification together with remission of
sins, a man receives by JESUS CHRIST unto whom he is ingraffed, all these
things infused together: to wit, FAITH, HOPE, and CHARITY. For FAITH, except
that HOPE, and CHARITY be adioined thereunto, neither does perfectly unity
with CHRIST, nor make a man the lively member of his body. In regard whereof
it is most truly said Iac. 2, d
that FAITH without works is dead, and idle: And in Gal. 5, a Chrysostom. ho. 5.
in Io. Aug. l. 3. cot. 2. ep. Pelag. cap. 5. ho. 17. cap. 2 ex 50. lib. 15.

CHRIST JESUS, neither Circumcision auailethe ought, nor prepuce, but FAITH
that works by CHARITY: This Faith before the Sacrament of Baptism, the
Catechumens according to the Tradition of the Apostles, do demand of the
Church when they ask Faith, which yields life everlasting: which truly
without HOPE and CHARITY, FAITH cannot afford. And therefore they do presently
hear that word of CHRIST. Mat. 19, c
If thou will enter into life, keep the Commandments. Therefore receiving
true and Christian Justice; that same, even as the first stole given unto them
by Jesus Christ, for that which ADAM by his disobedience lost for himself and
us; they are presently after their regeneration, commanded to keep white and
unspotted, that they may bring the same before the judgment seat of our Lord
Jesus Christ, and have life everlasting.

12. How it is understood, that a wicked man by Faith, and freely is
justified.

ANd whereas the Apostle To. 3, ^ Aug. de praedest. sanct. c. 7. ser. 38. de
temp.
says that a man is justified by FAITH, and freely, those words are to be
understood in that sense, which the continual consent of the Catholic Church
has held and taught. To wit, that we are therefore said to be justified by
Faith, because Faith is the beginning of man's salvation, the foundation and
root of all Justification: Heb. 11, b
without the which it is impossible to please God, and to come to the society
of his children: And we are therefore said to be justified Aug. l. 6. Hypog.
c. 4. l. 1. quaest. ad Simplic. qu. 2. lib. 1. cont. Pelag. et Coelest. cap.
31. sermon. 15. de verb. Apost. c. 2. de spir. et lit. cap. 26. Prosp. ad 3.
prima. dub. Gennuen. Haimo. in Romans 3.
freely, because none of all those things that go before justification,
whether it be Faith, or Works, do deserve the grace of Justification. For if
it be Grace, now not of works, otherwise, as the same Apostle says, To. 11, ^
Grace now is not grace.

13 Against the vain confidence of Heretics.

ANd although it be necessary to believe, that sins neither are nor ever
have been forgiven, but freely through the mercy of God, for CHRIST his sake:
yet must we say, that to no man which braggeth of a confidence and certainty
of the remission of his sins, and which rests only in that, either are or
ever were sins forgiven: whereas even among Heretics and Schismatikes, this
vain confidence, and void of all piety, may be, yea and is in these our
days, and with great contention is vaunted off against the Catholic Church.

But neither* is this to be affirmed, that those which are truly justified,
ought for to assure themselves, without any manner Job. 9, d Psalm. 18, c
Eccles. 9, ^. Eccli. 5, b Pro 20, b 1. Cor. 4, a Aug. de perf. just. cap. 15.

of doubt, that they are justified; and that no man is absolved from his
sins and justified, but he who does assuredly believe that he is absolved and
justified, and that by this Faith only, absolution and justification is
accomplished: as though he that believed not that, must needs doubt of the
promises of Almighty God, or of the efficacy of CHRIST'S death and
Resurrection. For as no godly person ought to dout of the mercy of GOD, of the
meritte of CHRIST, and of the virtue and efficacy of the Sacraments; so every
man considering himself, and his own infirmity and indisposition; may justly
have some fear of his own grace: whereas with certainty of Faith (in which
there cannot be any falsehood) no man can know that he has obtained the Grace
of God.

14 Of the increase of Justification once received.

THey therefore who are thus justified, and made the friends and Ephesians. 2, d
domesticalls of God, going from virtue to virtue, Ps. 83, b
are renewed, as says the Apostle, ^. Cor. 4. d
from day to day: that is to say, by mortifying Col. 3, a
the members of the flesh: and To. 6, b Aug. de morib. Eccles. Cathol. cap.

exhibiting them as instruments of Justice unto sanctification; by the
observation of the commandementes of God and of the Church; in that Justice
which they have received by the grace of CHRIST, (Faith cooperating with good
Works) they do increase and are more justified, as it is written: Apoc. 22, c
He that is just, let him be justified yet: And again, Eccli. 18, c
Do thou not fear to be justified even unto death. And again, you do see
that by works a man is justified, and not by Faith only. And this increase of
Justice, does the holy Church demand when she prays: Give us, O Lord,
increase of Faith, Iac. 2, d

obtain the inheritance, although be suffer not with To. 8, c
CHRIST, that so he may be also glorified with Christ. For eue^ Christ himself
as the Apostle Heb. 5, ^
says: Whereas he was the son of God, he learned by those things which he
suffered, obedience: and being consummate, was made to all those that obey him,
cause of eternal salvation. And for that cause the Apostle himself
admonishes the justified, saying. 1. Cor. 9, d
Know you not that they that run in the race* all run in deed, but one
receives the prise? So run that you may obtain. I therefore so run, not
as it were at an uncertain thing: so I fight, not as it were beating the air:
But I chastise my body, and bring it into servitude, least perhaps when I have
preched to others, my self become a reprobate. Also the Prince of the Apostles
S. PETER 2. Pet. 1, b
Brethren, labor the more that by good works you may make sure your vocation
and election: for doing these things you shall not sin at any time.

Whereby it appears, that they go against the true doctrine of the Catholic
Religion, who say, that a just man in every good work sins at least Job. 1,

as they also do err, who hold that just men do sin in all their works, if
in the^, for to excite their own sloth, and to encourage themselves to run
in the raze; having withal their principal end that God may be glorified:

hope of glory, and not yet into glory, they ought to fear the combat which
is yet behind, Bern ser. 5 in vigil. natiuit. Dom. ser. 5. in Psalm. Qui

with the world, the flesh, and the devil: In which combat they cannot be
conquerours, except being helped with the grace of God they obey the Apostle
saying: We are debtors not to the flesh, To. ^, c
to live according to the flesh: For if you live according to the flesh you
shall die: But if by the spirit you mortify the deeds of the flesh, you shall
live.

18 Of them that are fallen, and their reparation.

But they which by sin have fallen, from the received grace of justification,
may Aug ho* 50 ex 50. ^^ de quaest. 1. and 2. of the Sacrament of Penance*
be justified again: when Almighty God stirring the^ up: by the Sacrament of
Penance through the merits of Christ they shall procure to recover the lost
grace. For this manner of Justification is the reparation of him that is fallen,
which the holy Fathers have Vide of the Sacrament of Penance quaest 2. 199.
aptly called the second Table after the shipwreck of the loss of grace. For
in the behalf of them that do fall into sin after Baptism, Christ Jesus
has instituted the Sacracrament of Penance, when he said: Io. 20, c ibid.
quaest. 1. page 197.
Receive ye the holy Ghost, whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven
them, and whose you shall retain, they are retained. And therefore we must say,
that the Penance of a Christian man after his fall, is far different from
that of Baptism: And that therein is contained not only a ceasing from sin,
and a detestation thereof, or a contrite Psalm. 50. See page 199 201.
and humble heart: but also that See qu. 3. and 6. ibide^.
Sacramental confession is to be made of the same, at the least in desire, and
at due time: and there is necessary also the absolution of a Priest, as also
satisfaction, See qu. 7. and 8. ibide^.
by Fasting, Alms, Prayers, and other devout exercises of a spiritual life:
not certes for the everlasting pain, which either by the Sacrament or by the
desire of the Sacrament is remitted, together with the fault; but for the
temporal punishment which as Number. 12, d ^. Reg. 12, c 24, b See qu^est. 7.
page 210.
the holy Scripture does teach, is not, as it is in Baptism, wholly remitted
unto them, which being ungrateful, unto the grace of God, which they once
received, have Ephesians. 4, g
contristated the holy Ghost, and have not been afraid 1. Cor. 3, d
to violate the Temple of Almighty God. Of which penance it is written: Apo.
2, b
Be mindful from whence thou art fallen, and do Penance, and do the first
works. And again* 2. Cor. 7, c
The sorrow that is according to God, works Penance unto salvation which is
stable. And again: Mat. ^, c
Do Penance: Luc. 3, c
And yield fruits worthy of Penance.

19 That by every mortal sin grace is lost, but not Faith.

ANd against the subtle devises of some men, who by sweet speeches To. 16, c
and benedictions do seduce the hearts of Innocents, we must affirm: that not
only by infidelity, by which even Faith it self is lost: but also by every
other Iac. 2, b Bas. lib. 1. de Baptis. par. 2 and lib. 2, c. 9.
mortal sin whatsoever, although Mat. 7, c d 25, a Luc. 12. f Io. 12, g 1.

Fulgent. de incar. and gratia Christi c. 26.
Faith be not lost, yet the received grace of Iustificacion is lost: defending
hereby the doctrine of Gods law, which excludes from the Kingdom of God, not
only Infidells, but also the Faithful, that are 1. Cor. 6, b Gal. 5, c d
Ephesians. 5, b Apoc. 21, c
Fornicatours, Aduouterers, Effeminate, Liers with mankind, Thieves Covetous
persons, Drunkerdes, Railers, Extortioners, and all others that co^mitt mortal
sin: from which they may with the help of Gods grace abstain, and for which
they are separated from the grace of Christ.

20 Of the fruit of Justification, that is to say, of the merit of good
works, and of the reason of the same merit.

THerefore unto those persons, that are by these means Justified, whether they
have perpetually preserved the grace received, or recovered it again being
lost: these words of the Apostle are to be proposed, 1. Cor. 15, g
Abound ye in every good work, knowing that your labor is not vain in our
Lord. Heb. 6, b
For god is not unjust that he should forget your work, and love which you
have showed in his name. And: Heb. 10, g
Do not leese your confidence which has a great remuneration. And therefore
to such as work well to the end, and hope in Almighty God; life everlasting is
to be proposed, both as a grace mercifully promised through JESUS CHRIST, to
the sons of God: and as a reward Aug. de great. de lib. arbit. c. 8. 9. epist

also, by the promise of God himself faithfully to be rendered to their good
works and deserts. For this is that crown of Justice, which after his
conflict and course, the 2. Tim. 4, b Aug. ho. 14. ex 50. cap. 2. in Psalm. ^^.
tract. 3. in Joan. Theoph. and Oecum. in cap. 4. ep. 2. ad Ti^.
Apostle said was laid up for himself, to be rendered unto him by the just
Judge: and not only to him, but also to all those that love his coming. For
whereas Christ JESUS himself does continually instill virtue into the
justified, as the head into the members, and the vine into the branches: which
virtue always goes before, accompanies, and follows Conc. 2. Araus. can.
18. Aug. de correp. and gratia cap. 13. de great. and lib. arbit. cap. 6. ser.
15 de verb. Apost. cap. 2. Fulg. lib. 1. ad Moni. cap. 11.12.
their good works, and without which, those works can by no means be
grateful to God and meritorious: it is to be thought that there is nothing now
wanting unto the justified, but that with those works, which are done Io. 3, c
in god, they may be deemed, according to the state and conditon of this life,
fully to have satisfied the law of God, Aug. sent. 313. Prosp.
and to have truly deserved life everlasting, to be possessed also in the due
time, if they depart out of this world in grace. Forasmuch as CHRIST our
Savior says: Io. 4, b
He that shall drink of the water that I will give him, shall not thirst for
ever, but it shall become in him a fountain of water springinge up unto life
everlasting. So, neither our own proper justice, as proper from our selves, is
established, neither are we ignorant of the justice of God, or do reject the
same. For, that which is called our justice, because by it being inherent in us
we are justified: that very same justice, is the justice of God, because it is
by God infused into us through the merit of Christ.

Neither is this to be omitted, that although there be so much attributed to
good works in holy scripture, that even unto him Mat. 10, d
that shall give a cup of cold water to one of his little ones, Christ does
promise that he shall not loose his reward: and the 2. Cor. 4, d
Apostle witnesses, that, the tribulation which presently is momentanie and
light, works above measure exceedingly, an eternal weight of glory in us:
yet God forbid that a Christian man, should either Aug. de Praed. sanct. ca. 5.
de great. and lib. arbit. cap. 6.
trust or 1. Cor. 1, d 2. Cor. 10, d
glory in himself, and not in our Lord: whose goodness is such toward all
men, that he will have those things to be their Coelest. l. ep. 1. can. 11.
Aug. in Ench. c. 107. ep. 105. de gratia et lib. arbit. cap. 6. Gennad lib. de

merits, which are his gifts. And because Iac. 3, a
all of us offend in many things, every one ought to have, as mercy and
goodness, so also severity and judgment before his eyes: no man judging
himself, although 1. Cor. 4, a
he be not guilty in conscience of any thing: because the wholl life of man, is
to be examined and judged not by the judgment of man, but of God, who Ibidem.
will lighten the hidden things of darkness, and will manifest the
counsels of the hearts: and then the praise shall be to every man of God, who,
as it is written: Mat. 16, d Romans 2, a Psalm. 61, b
will render to every man according to his works.

The Translatour to the Reader.
HITHERTO (gentle Reader) have I performed the part of a Translatour: how
faithfully and soundly, thy self shall judge. Yet this will I promise of my
self, that there has not wanted that diligence, which in Translating a work
of matters of CATHOLIC Doctrine; abounding with so many places of Scripture,
or rather compacte of words and sentences of Scriptures and Fathers; and in so
short a Volume setting down the whole sum of our RELIGION: is in any
Learned man's judgment necessary. Now whereas I have found in the running
over this notable work, some few questions, either not touched at all, or not
so thoroughly handled, as the necessity of our COUNTRY does require: I have
here thought good with as much breuity as the things will permit, and
according to my simple skill in DIVINITY, to address thee the same: that thou
having as it were in one Posie, each pleasant flower contained, may be
prepared against all manner of pestilent vapors, which in so unsavory an air
thou may meet withal. Thy part it shall be, that as with the going
forewarde of this work, my desire of thy spiritual good has increased: so
thou also do continue, if not increase, the grateful acceptance of my labors.

AN EXPOSITION OF CERTAIN QVESTIons not handeled in this Book.
I. Of Hallowed and Sanctified Creatures, used in the Church. II. Of Pilgrimage
unto holy places. III. Of Indulgences, or Pardons. IIII. Of Service and Prayer
in the Vulgar tongue. Every one divided into certain Articles, in which are
also expounded diverse other Controversies, belonging to the better
understanding of the principal Question.
OF HALLOWED AND SANCTIFIED CREATVRES IN GODS CHVRCH.
1 Is there any creature holier than another?

ALthough all sanctity and holiness be principally in God himself: yet from
him as from a most plentiful fountain of all goodness, does also spring and
flow holiness into his creatures: first into his reasonable creatures, who
only may by his grace be made his lively members, and so be endowed with true
holiness: and than, both the Sacraments by which he works his grace, and
whatsoever thing has any speaciall relation or order unto the holiness which
is in God or in his creatures, may justly and truly be called holy. And
concerning the sanctification of the members of Christ's mystical body, and the
holiness of his Sacraments by which we are sanctified to everlasting life:
enough has been said before in this wholle book* but of the holiness of other
creatures religiously deputed in the Church, for our spiritual good: we mean
here briefly to entreat: and namely of Holy days Holy water, Hallowed Palms,
Ashes, Oil, and finally of Hallowed places.

2 Is not the different estimation of days contrary to holy Scriptures?

NO verily: for we account some days holier than other, by the example of God
himself who sanctified the Gen, 2, 3
Sabbath, and commanded also the same to be hallowed by Exodus ^0.1.
his people, with many other days, which he calls holy, solemn and
venerable days: yea the people of God, did not only Religiously observe these
days, but also upon new occasions of singular benefits received from God,
they instituted new Feasts and deuoutely observed the same. As we read of
the Feast instituted by Esth. 9, 27
Mardocheus, and the dedicatio^ 1. Match. 4, 56.
ordained by Judas Machabeus, and honored by our Io. 20, 22
Saviors own presence. Neither does this difference of days so long as it is
not observed according to the ceremonious figures of the Jews, which are now
expired: nor according to the vain and superstitious observation of the
Gentiles, which To. 14, 5. Gal. 4, 10. Col. 2, 16. vide Theod. and Theoph.
Orig. Amb. Oecum. Primas. Ansel. in To. 14. Hier. lib. 2. in Iouin. Amb. in Gal

the Apostle condemns: even in the new Law of grace repugne against the Law
of God: yea it is agreeable to holy Scriptures, and according to the continual
practice of the Church. So do we see in steed of the Jews Sabbath the Act. 20

notes: of the lawefulnesse of Pilgrimage; of which we will speak hereafter.
So do we also observe the Feasts of the Passion of our LORD, of Easter, of
Ascension, and others, which S. Augustine says Epist. 118.
eitther undoubtedly to have been instituted in general Councels, or rather
to have proceeded from the Apostles themselves, as these forenamed Feasts must
needs, whereas they are motioned of Fathers Clem. lib. 5. constable. c. 21 Iren.
apud Just. q. 115. Tert. lib. de cor. mil. Orig. lib. 8. Con Cells.
more ancient than any general Counsel.

Finally of the holy days of our LORD, thus says Lib. 10. ciu. cap. 16.
S. Augustine, We dedicate and consecrate the memory of Gods benefits with
solemnities, Feasts, and certain appointed days: least by tract of times
there might creep in ungrateful and unkind oblivion. But of Festiuities of
Martyrs: the same says thus. Lib. 20. cont. Faust. cap. 21.
Christian people, Celebrate the memory of Gods Martyrs with religious
solemnity, both to move themselves to imitaton of them, and that they may be
partakers of their merits, and be helped with their prayers. And of all Saints
generally: In Ps. 88. Conc. 2 vid. Clem. lib. 8. constable. c. 39. Eccl. Smyrn.

Keep ye and celebrate with sobriety, the natiuities of Saints, that we may
imitate them which have gone before us, and they may rejoice with us, which
pray for us.

These days therefore are worthily accounted more holy and reverend, than
other ordinary and profane days: because they represent unto us the singular
liberallity of Almighty God showed in them, first in the person of our
Savior: as the Sunday: (of which insteede of all the Feasts of our LORD, we
we will exemplify) on which day he was borne, rose again and sent the
Holy Ghost. And therefore that day representing unto us the Nativity of Christ
both unto this life, and unto immortal glory: and also the nativity of the
Church by the holy ghost: is no doubt of greater dignity tha^ the Sabbath of
the Jews. For that day in that it signified a grateful memory of things
passed: did only carry a relation unto the material creation of the world. And
in that it represented things to come; partly it is to be abolished, for that
those things now be He. 4, 10.
fulfilled: (as the rest of Christ in the Sepulcher from his works of our
redemption: Aug tra. 30. in Io.
the rest and quiet of those which are regenerate in Christ from the servile
works of sin: and the Aug. ep. 119.
rest of holy souls in the bosom of Abraham:) Partly it is more notably and
excellently supplied by the DOMINICAL day. For the Sunday far more exceeding
that, in signification of rest: representethe unto the devout obseruers
thereof, the everlasting glory revealed in Christ rising from death, and
expected of all those which are his lively members. As S. Augustine Ibid.
notes.

Now in the Feasts of Saints also, we both Celebrate the memory of so great a
benefit, as is the birthday of our brethren into Heaven, and their Assumption
to so high a dignity, and their glorious triumph over the world, the flesh,
and the devil: and we rejoice also at so good examples given to all the
Church, and a new patron in heaven, and a new cause of joy to all the
Celestial Court.

This therefore is the conclusion of this our discourse: that some days
especially, and before others, according to the custom of holy Scripture, and
the ancient Fathers of the Church, Amb. ser. 62. Aug. Praef. in ep. Io. and l.
22. ciu. cap. 30. and lib. 20. cont. Faust. c. 21. and ser. 21. detemp. Leo.
sermon. 4. de quadr.
are truly called Holy, Sacred, Mystical, and of religious solemnity.

3 And what must we esteem of holy Water, and such like?

AS we call some days more holy and religious than others, so do we also say
the same of many other Creatures of God, which although they be good of
themselves, as created by him which is essentiallie good, and Genesis 1, 31.
saw that all things that he made were very good: Yet because both they for
our punishment oftentimes become hurtful unto us, either by their own
quality and disposition, or by the malice Greg. lib. 1. dial. cap. 4 Aug. lib.

of the Devil, and also for to bring to pass and signify some spiritual
effect: they be very holesomly 1. Tim. 4, 5.
sanctified by the word of God and Prayer, as Saint Paul has written, and
Mat. 14, 19. Luc. 9, 16.

examples of the effect thereof. And S. Basil calls it an Apostolical
Tradition: as it may alos appear by the Apostles own Scholars, who make
mention of the same.

But S. Alexander, he who 50. years after S. Peter governed the Church: of
holy water says thus. showing both the ancient use thereof, and by giving a
general commandment confirming that which before he practiced. We bless
water sprinkled with salt for the people: that al being sprinkled with it,
may be sanctified and purified: which thing also we ordain as to be done of
all Priests. For if the ashes of Heb. 9, 13.
an Heifer being sprinkled with blood, did sanctify and cleanse the people:
much more water sprinkled with salt, and consecrated with divine prayers,
does sanctify and cleanse the people. And if by salt sprinkled by Heliseus
the Prophet, the barrennes of the water was healed: how much more the same
salt being consecrated with divine prayers, takes away the barrennes of
humane things, and sanctifies those which are defiled, and cleanses, and
purges, and multiplieth other good things, and turns away the deceites of
the Devil, and defends men from the craftines of the evil ghost. For if by
the touching of the Mat. 9, 11.
hemme of the garment of our Savior we do not doubt, but that the diseased
were cured: how much more by the virtue of his holy words are his elements
consecrated, by which humane frailty does receive health both of body and
soul. Thus far S. Alexander in his Epistle.

self both in Sacraments and out of them occupied diverse of his creatures, for
the manifold good of ma^kinde, and his miraculous operations. That we may
omit the purging of venial and quotidian sins, Vide. S. Thom. 3. part. qu.

which is by these Sacramental things bestowed upon us, not only by the
increase of our faith fervor and devotion, which is procured by the using of
them: but also by the high authority of the chief Ministers of the Church,
granting us the same as Saint Gregory Lib. 7. ep. 126. and lib. 9. ep. 60.
used when he sent any holy tokens: and now is used besides the things above
remembered: in hallowed memories of our religion.

4 But wherefore do we accounte one place more holy than another?

VVHo-soeuer deniethe that one place in holiness exceeds another, knows
not the Scriptures, which in respect of the apparitions made by God in diverse
places attribute a certain holiness unto them. And oftentimes in confirmation
thereof imposes Genesis 22, 14. and 35, 16
upon such places names to signify the presence of Gods power therein. Yea our
Savior says Mat. 25, 17.
that the temple sanctifies the gold, and the Altar the gift, signifying
thereby an extraordinary holiness in the temple: and 2. Pet. 1, 18. Hier. ep.
17.
S. Peter calls the mount Thabor because of the transfiguration of CHRIST
therein, the holy Hill. That we need not Vide Hier. vbi supra. and epist. 17.
and in Epita. Paulae.
to doubt but the like holiness is to be attributed to the places of his
Nativity, Passion, Burial, Resurrection, and Ascension. For this cause was
Moises Exo. 3, 5. Act. 7, 33.
commanded to loose his shoes from his feet, because the place wherein he
stood was holy ground. And by the like apparition made by an Angel unto
Iosue, Ios. 5, 15.
the like holiness was caused in the place. For this cause in the old Temple
was even private prayers 3. Reg. 8, 30. 2. Par. 6, 21. 3. Reg. 9, 3. Esa. 56,
7. Mat. 21, 13. vide 1. Reg. 1, 11. 2. Reg. 7, 18. 1. Par. 21. 30 Luc. 2, 37.
and 18, 10. Act. 8, 27.
made, as in a place speaciallie dedicated unto prayer, and therefore called a
house of Prayer. And Daniel being Dan. 6, 10. 3. Reg. 8, 48. 2. Par. 6, 37.
in Babylon a captive opening his window prayed toward Jerusalem according to
the common custom of the Jews: and S. Peter and S. Ihon Act. 3, 1.
went up into the Temple to pray. For this cause are and always have been
amongst Christians certain particular 1. Cor. 11, 18.22.34. et 14, 34. Clem.

places severed from the common and profane use, to the religion and worship
of God: which therefore, and for the solemn consecration and dedication of the
same by Gods chief ministers; have always been esteemed of a singular kind
of holiness. And that very worthelie. For unless God were in a more speaciall
manner in the Church than in other places: the Apostle would not have proved
God to dwell in his faithful people after a peculiar 1. Cor. 3, 16* and 6, 19.
and 2. Cor. 6.16. Vide Aug l. ^. ad Simplic. q 4.
manner, by his dwelling in the^ as in a temple. How often in the Scripture do
we read of the holiness of the Temple, and of Sancta Sanctorum. And God
promised 3. Reg. 9, 3.
to hear easily the prayers of his people offered up to him in his temple: not
that he does 1. Tim. 2, 8.
not hear every where if he be Io. 4, 23.
worshipped in spirit and truth, that is, with the spiritual and inward
disposition of his holy faith and love and with an humble heart, not neglecting
See before page. 366.
also in time and place the outward ceremonies, gestures and words: or that he
may be comprehended in a Church made with hands; Act. 7, 48
whereas he fills both heaven and earth; but because it pleases him, for our
profitte, to work his wonders, and to be worshipped rather in holy places tha^
in profane. And what marvel if these places being once consecrated Eusebius. l.

and dedicated unto God: have in them a certain heavenly virtue: when the
things which are profanely to be used be 1. Tim. 4, 5.
sanctified by the word of God and Prayer? if God himself say 3. Reg. 9,
that he sanctified the temple at the sanctification of the same made by
Solomon? Yea if, (as S. Chrysostom Hom. 1. super vidi Dominum.
says) the Angels do fill that place espeacially which is about the Altar?
S. Gregory witnesses 3. Dial. cap. 30.
that God by miracle showed his presence at the dedicatio^ of a Church, when
(the Devil being gone thence in the likeness of a sow) a cloud came from
heaven, and lighting upon the Altar and covering it, filled the wholle Church
with so great a reverence and sweet savor, that none durst presume to enter
in. No otherwise than happened in the dedication of the Tabernacle Ex vlt.
by Moises and the 3. Reg. 8.
Temple by Solomon. Whose wonderful virtue Heliodorus a Gentile had felt: when
he said: 2. Match. 3, 39.
In that place is verily a certain virtue of God; for he which dwells in
heaven is a visiter and helper of that place. Finally to say, that because
Almighty God is according to his Godhead in all places: he does no more
sanctify one place than another: is to confound divine and profane things,
yea to join heaven and hell together, as though the one were no more reverend
and holy than the other: whereas heaven therefore is holy, because in it God
does show himself there unto his Saints and Angels: and for the presence of
the humanity of Christ and of his elect in the same.

Let us therefore conclude this question in this manner: that, as God who is
only holy of himself, does sanctify his reasonable creatures by his grace:
and has instituted holy Sacraments as instruments of working the same grace:
and has Sanctified partly himself, partly by the Church his Spouse,
certain particular days to the memory of his benefits and wonders: and 1.
Tim. 4, 5.
by his word at the prayers of his Church gives a kind of holiness to
diverse of his Creatures ordained to the stirring and procuring our devotion,
and the purification of our souls: so does he by a particular assistance and
presence of his Majesty, or of his Angels and Saints, sanctify some special
places, according as it seems to his divine goodness and wisdom. As also
shall be more particularly declared hereafter.

OF PILGRIMAGE.
1 What do we respect in places of Pilgrimage, more than in other Churches and
places of devotion?

FIrst, I Churches of Saints.
we may respect the devotion to that special Saint, whose Church we intend
to visit, which happily has no memory in the place where we dwell. For that
Churches have been erected to the memory and honor of Saints even since the
Primative Church, and the time when Christians might have public Churches: all
ancient Fathers and histories do give evident Cyr. cat. 16. Athan. in ep. ad

vlt. Carth. 5. cap. 14.
testimony: and the Monuments of al Countries do show: so that it is
sufficient to note some places of Fathers, whose antiquity the Reader seeing,
may withal behold the antiquity of the truth it self. Neither does this
thing any way hinder or preiudicate the honor of God: whereas his glory is
the final end of all honor yielded to his Saints: And the very temple of
Solomon 1. Par. 17, 1. and 28, 2. 2. Par. 5, 2.
was both intended by David, and erected by Solomon his Son, not only to
sacrifice unto God and to power out prayers to his divine Majesty: but also
that it might be a reverend place of rest for the Psalm. 131, 8
Arc of his sanctification, aad for the 1. Par. 28, 2.
footestoole of his most holy feet as the scripture it self records. That
we need not to doubt, but for the like reason, we may erect reverend memories
unto Saints, where their holy relickes which were 1. Cor. 6, 19.
lively temples and holy instruments by which Almighty God himself 2. Cor.
13, 3. Aug. lib. 1. ciu. cap. 13.
did speak: may be with due honor reserved. Yea moreover although there be
no relickes at all of them in that place: yet as it is lawful to yield them
the honor of a Church when their relickes be present: so, alihough they be
absent; their souls being never the less glorious in heaven, in both cases
do serve a like.

And although there may be at home the memories of as glorious and worthy
Saints, as abroad: yet neither is it our parts to make such comparison: and
the very reverend newnes of the place abroad stirs up devotion: and God
himself (who divides 2. Cor. 12, 11.
to every one as he will) often times according to his secret disposition,
grau^teth our petitions, and works miracles, at one place, and by the
intercession of one Saint and not of another: as S. Augustine Aug. ep. 137. ad
Clerum. and pop. Hippon.
well notes.

II Relickes.
Secondly we may in Pilgrimage respect the Sacred relickes of Saints remaining
in several places: which as we said before do deserve undoubted honor: for
that they have bin temples of the holy Ghost: instruments both of their souls
to al good things, and also of Gods miracles and wonders: they are holy pledges
Aug. l. 22. ciu. cap. 8.
of our Patrones: remnantes of our most dear friends: memories of triumphant
conquerors: designed unto everlasting and unspeakable glory. Neither want we
in this matter examples of holy scripture and testimonies of many holy Fathers.
S. Hierome disputing against Vigilantius, one, whom the contempt of relics
has made a famous Heretic; and defending the honor of relics: affirms
that God himself did honor in a certain manner the body of Deuteronomy. vit.
Moises, burying it with his own hands. And least this word of Gods honoring
the body of Moises, may seem strange to some contentious head: let him
consider that Christ himself says: Io. 12, 26.
If any man minister to me, my Father will honor him. The bones also of
Heliseus 4. Reg. 13, 21.
raised a dead body unto life. We read of the sepulcher of CHRIST our Savior:
Esa. 11, 10.
In him shall the Gentiles hope, and his Sepulcher shall be glorious. Which
sentence S. Hierome understanding as needs it To. 15, 12.
must be understood, of the Sepulcher of CHRIST, uses as an argument to
Marcella to inuit her to the holy Land.

Finally in the Scripture we learn that it is no superstition reverently to
esteem of the very 4. Reg. 5, 17.
Land which God honored with his promises and wonders: or to touch with
devotion Christ's Mat. 9, 20.
garment: or to impute any virtue to Act. 5, 15.
Peter's shadows: or to Act. 19, 12.
S. Paul's Napkins, or Handkerchifes. Al which now a days would be counted
Idolatry (the more is the pity) if upon like opportunity offered, the like
devotion should be used, either to Christ, or to his holy Saints. For
whatsoever is done by their Relickes, is done by the Saints themselves. Of
which we have an evident testimony in the Acts of the Apostles, where that is
said to have been done by the hand of Paul, which it pleased God to show by
the things brought from his body.

Now of the testimony of Fathers approving and defending the honor of holy
Relickes, al books are so full: that it were an infinite labor to Copy out
their places. We will be content with a few of those which the Catholic
Doctors use to allege. Lib. 7. c. 15.
Eusebius reports that the wodden Chair of S. James was had in great
veneration. Even as now Saint Peter's Chair at Rome. S. Athanasius, In vita
Antonij.
as he says himself, having received Saint Anthonies threed-bare Cloak,
which the holy man dying bequeathed unto him: Did embrace Anthony in Anthonies
gifts, and enriched as it were with a great inheritance, joyfully by the
Vestiment remembereth the Image of his holiness. In Psalm. 115. in illud
Pretiosa in conspectu Domini mors Sanctorum eius.

Vide orat. in 40. Mart.


Saint Basil, When among the Jews any did die: their Corses were abhorred: but
when one dies for Christ, preciouse are the Relickes of his Saints. Before it
was said to the Priests and persons dedicated unto God: He shall not be
defiled with touching any dead body: but now who touches the bones of a
Martyr, receives a certain participation of holiness, from the grace
remaining in the body. Orat. in Theod.
Gregory Nyssene, after that he has described the devout entrance used to be
made by Christians into Martyrs Churches, and the earnest beholding of the
Buildings, and Images: says thus. When he has with these things delighted
his eyes: he desires to approach to the shrine it self: esteeming the very
touching thereof to be his Sanctification and benediction. But if any man
permit him to carry away the dust which does compass about the shrine; the
dust is taken for a reward, and as a thing of great price, is gathered up. As
for touching the relickes themselves, if at any time so good a chance do
happen, that he may do it: how much that is to be desired and wished, and with
how many entreaties it is granted, those which have proved, and enjoyed
their desire; do know.

S. Gregory Nazianzen reprehending Julian the Apostata, Orat. 1. in Iulia.
for his sacrilegious behavior toward the relics of Gods holy Saints:
Did thou not reverence those holy hosts slain for Christ? whose very bodies
alone are able to work the same which their holy souls, whether they be
touched with hands, or honored: yea whose very drops of blood and small
signs of their passions, are able to do the same, which their bodies*

Catech. 18.
S. Cyrill Bishop of Jerusalem: That not the souls only of Saints may be
honored, and that we may believe that in their bodies also being dead there is
virtue and power: a dead man lying in Heliseus his Sepulcher, and touching the
dead body of the Prophet, was restored to life.

Ser. de SS. Iuuent. and Maxim.
S. Chrysostom: Wherefore let us often visitte them: let us honor their
Tombs, and with great faith touch their relics, that thence we may receive
some benediction.

Lib. 8. ad Graecos.
Theodoretus showing the general custom of honoring relickes, and the great
fruit received thereby: has this saying. The souls of the triumphant
Martyrs, do now live in their heavenly Country, joined with the quiers of
Angels: But their bodies are not every one buried in several graves: but
wholle cities, towns and countries have divided them amongst them, and cease
not to acknowledge them very wholesome to diseased minds and to sick bodies.
For their bodies being divided, their force and grace remains wholle.

But S. Ambrose most plainlye and effectually shows the honor due unto
relickes in these words. Ser. 93. de SS. Nazar. and Cells.
But if thou ask me, what do thou honor in the flesh now resolved and
consumed? I honor in the flesh of the Martyr, the scarres received for CHRIST
his name: I honor the memory of one that lives by the perpetuity of his
virtue: I honor the ashes consecrated by the confession of our Lord: I honor
in the ashes the seeds of eternity: I honor the body which showed me how to
love our Lord, which for our Lords sake taught me not to fear death. And why
should not the faithful honor that body which the Devils do fear? which
they afflicted in the torment, and glorify in the Sepulcher? I honor
therefore the body which honored CHRIST in the sword, which with CHRIST shall
reign in heaven.

What S. Hierome thinks of this point, many of his works does testify,
espeacially that which of this matter he wrotte against Vigilantius wherein
against Vigilantius, Eunomius, Porphyrius, he most earnestly disputes of this
matter. Lib. 22. ciu. cap. 8.
But Saint Augustine reports so many miracles to have been wrought by Saint
Steuens relickes that wholle books cannot contain them. Wherefore writing
unto Quintianus, Epist. 103.
he says of those which carried his letters: They bring the relickes of the
most blessed and glorious Martyr Steven, which your holiness is not ignorant,
how conveniently ye ought to honor, even as we also have done.

We have been longer in alleging of Fathers, than we purposed: yet not without
expectation of great fruit: both because of the diverse calumniations of this
matter of relickes in these our days: and also that the reader may hereafter
rightly esteem of our fidelity, when for breuity sake being contented with
marginall quotations, we shall not rehearse the Fathers places at large.

And thus much of the second title of PILGRIMAGE, which is religiously to
visitte the relickes of Saints.

III Miracles at Relics and Images.
Let us now proceed to the third: which is the singular woonders which God does
work; and the most gracious gifts which he does bestow at these holy
places, where either there be the sacred Relickes of his Saints, or some
reverend Image of the same, or of himself. For many times it pleases GOD,
who is wonderful in his Saints Psalm. 67, 36.
to work his miracles at, and by their Relickes: and unto Images alalso,
besides the ordinary holiness which they have by representing the persons
whose Images they are: to give a new Sanctification: showing by them his mighty
power, and the exceeding honor Psalm. 138, 17.
to which he has exalted his Saints. And this he does at some special
places, more than others, according to his divine goodness and wisdom. God
is indeed (says Saint Augustine) Ep. 137. ad Hipponenses.
every where, and is not contained, or enclosed in any place, whereas he made
all things. Yet who can search out his Counsel, wherefore in some places
these miracles are done, in others they are not done? For unto many is well
known the holiness of the place where S. Foelix his body of Nola is buried,
whither I willed that two of my Clearks should go, because from thence it might
be more easily and faithfully written, whatsoever in any of them should be
miraculously wrought. Is not Affricke also full of Martyrs bodies? And yet we
know not in any place here about such things to be done. For (as the Apostle
says) 1. Cor. 12.
not all Saints have the gifts of curing diseases. So neither in all memories
of Saints, would he have these things done, who divides unto every one
proper gifts, even as he will.

And yet the same Saint Augustine Lib. 22. ciu. cap. 8.
reckons up diverse miracles wrought after that time in Afric: whose only
testimony in this behalf ought to be of sufficient creditte, Vide Epiph. in
vita Esaiae. Ezech. and Hieremiae. Bas. orat. in Maman. and orat. in Iulit ta^.

uncorrupted. See Chrysostom. ser. de SS. Iuuent. and Max. Hier. in Hilar. Aug. ser.

to any Christian mind. At a small quantity of the holy Land by S. Augustins
appointment dug into the ground, where an Oratory was also made over it: was
presently cured one sick of the palsy. A young man possessed of the Devil,
was delivered at the memory of SS. Geruasius and Protasius at a town called
Victoriana. At the memory of twenty Martyrs in Saint Augustines own town,
an old man called Florentius praying with a loud voice (not without derision
of certain young men standing by) for apparel, having lost his cloak:
miraculously found by the sea side a fish of great price, and in the same a
gould ring: which S. Augustine attributes unto those glorious Martyrs, who
bou^tifully had determined to cloathe their orator. But at Saint Steuens
relickes infinite were the miracles which were wrought as S. Augustine himself
does testify. A blind woman received her sight, by touching her eyes with
flowers which had touched those holy pledges. Lucillus a Bishop only by
carrying the same Saints relicke, was suddenly cured of a fistula. Eucharius a
Priest was cured of the stone, and afterward of another disease lying for
dead, was miraculously raised. Martial by flowers brought from S. Steuens
memory, was moved to be a Christian, which before he had obstinately denied:
presently sending for the Bishop of the city, who at that instant was with S.
Augustine at Hippo.

Three were healed of the gout. A little child crushed to death with a carte
running over him, was restored to life and to his former soundnes. Note by
these examples that things wc have been touched with Relickes are also to be
accounted Relickes. See Gregory Nyss cited before. and S. Amb. ep 85. See also
S. Aug. ser. 95. of a memory of S. Steven at Ancona, only because of one stone
with which he was stoned, there reserved.
A Nun being dead was raised to life, only by laying upon her, her own
garment which was made before to touch the relickes. The like happened to a
daughter of one Bassus in Hippo it self. Where also with oil brought from the
same relics, the dead son of one Hyreneus being anointed, received his
life again. Eleusinus in the same city laid the dead body of his Son
upon the aforesaid memory and reciued him living.

The same Saint also at large sets down a wonderful miracle done upon
Easter Day at the same Relickes, he being tha^ with the wholle people present
in the Church. To conclude he says, that being only but two years since they
had any memory of this saint in his city: the miraculous cures of diseases
which they by diligent inquiry found (and yet they could not find all) came
to the number of threescore and ten. And reporting a strange thing which
happened unto one Petronia a Noble woman: he adds this sentence worthy to be
laid before the eyes of Heretics of our time: This do not they believe, who
also believe not our Savior to have been brought forth by the clausures of
his Mother not stirred; and to have entered into his Disciples, the doors being
shut. A sufficient admonition for all those which have care of their own
souls, not to regard the wicked scoffs and tauntes, used by those Mockers

things soever certes they are ignorant of, they blaspheme: and what things
soever naturally as dumme beasts they know: in those they are corrupted. As
very truly wrote S. Jude the Apostle of them and all others their
predecessors. For, as we willingly follow, and joyfully acknoweledge for our
Fathers, so many Saints and Doctors alleged before: so they truly, follow

of which some complained that we make our Martyrs idols, yielding them those
honors, which in ancient times the Idolaters grossly and superstitiously
gave to their own inventions: others impiously burnt and sacrilegiously
profaned the sacred relickes: no otherwise than in our days has been done
by the bodies of the glorious lights of Gods Church, Ireneus, Hilarious,
Martinus: that we may for natural affection and piety, conceal the barbarous
dealings of some of our own contrymen, to the eternal shame and reproach
even of the rest which little deserved it; and the setting forth to the show of
the wholle world, and to all posterity (if the day of judgment be not over
near such senseless demeanours:) the detestable brutishnes of heresy and
infidelity. Heliseus 4. Reg. 2, 23.

only indeed to deface the glory of CHRIST: Give glory to God, we know that

How can a man that is a sinner do these things? And: Verse. 30.
In this it is marvelous that you know not whence he is, and he has opened my
eyes. And we know that sinners God does not hear: but if a man be a seruer of
God and do his will, him he hears. From the beginning of the world it has
not been heard, that any man has opened the eyes of one borne blind. Unless
this man were of God, he could not do any thing.

Miracles are the work of God Psalm. 71, 18. and 135, 4
alone: who shows his miracles and wonders to confirm the truth, and to be a
testimony of Mar. vlt. verse. 20. Heb. 2, 4.
his own approbation. Wherefore S. Augustine says that he was Lib. de vtil.
cred. c. 17. and lib. cont. epist. ^und. cap. 4.
held in the Church Vinculis miraculorum, by the chains of miracles. And an
ancient, learned and famous Doctor was bold to say Ric. de S. Vict. lib. 1.
de Trin. c. 2.
O Lord, if it be an error which we believe; we have been deceived by thee.
For these things amongst us have been confirmed with such signs and wonders,
as could not be done but by thy self. Whereas therefore God himself with so
many miracles, examined and approved by as zealous, learned, and Godly
Doctors as our new men, I will not say, now are; but even when they are become
great Saints and true servants of GOD, (which GOD grant they may at the
last) are like to be; has commended unto us the honor of relickes; and
confirmed the general received devotion of the faithful people toward them:
he does no less bind us to believe that they are worthy of honor and
reverence: than he did in times past, by his miracles exact and demand
creditt of Exodus 4, 8.
Pharao. Iudic. 6, 17.37.
Gedeon, Luc. 1, 20.
Zachary, Mar. 16, 20.
and such other like, yea and of those to whom the Apostles preached: in those
particular things which tha^ he propounded.

Now that which we have hither to said of the miracles wrought by relickes and
before relickes, (always understanding God the principal worker by the^ as by
his instruments:) may also be applied unto Images. For as in both relickes and
images, the principal reason of the honor yielded unto them, is the Saint
himself whose they are, and whom they represent: so is there equal reason of
showing miracles by them both. Which, how God has in effect wrought in his
Church: many examples do show. A certain herb growing Eusebius. l. 7 hist.

for the confirmation of this verity, and the manifest defense of this third
title of PILGRIMAGES. But these shall suffice no doubt, to all such as do not
wilfully harden their hearts and obstinately shut their eyes and ears from the
manifest light and sound doctrine of Christ and his holy Church.

The fourth title of Pilgrimage is that thereby, IIII Satisfaction and Penance
for sins.
as by all painful and laborious works, we do bring forth fruits of Conc.
Cabil. 2. cap. 45
repentance, and take some kind of revenge of our sins committed, and mortify
our earthly members, and take up the Cross of Christ, and with him suffer
somewhat according to our frailty, that we may with him also be glorified. For
which cause S. Paul amongst other his paineful and meritorious works,
reckons also these. 2. Cor. 11, 26.
Night and day have I been in the depth of the Sea, in iourneing often,
perils of waters, perils of thieves, perils of my Nation, perils of
Gentiles, perils in the City, perils in the wilderness, perils in the Sea,
perils among false brethren, in labor and misery, in much watchings, in
hunger and thirst, in Fastings often, in cold and nakedness. etc. But of this
satisfaction there has been enough said before. See page 209.


V Exercise of diverse Virtues.
Fifthly, in Pilgrimage we exercise many and diverse virtues. FAITH: in that we
believe the Saints, who were men passible, like unto us now to reign with
CHRIST, and that their bodies shall be raised again and glorified. HOPE: in
that we seek by their intercession to attain to that which they have already
received. CHARITY: in that we for the love of God principally, and also of
them, as our neighbors in the highest degree, show our selves ready to do
any grateful thing unto them. HVMILITY: in that we humble our selves unto
them of what condition, age, sex or degree soever they were: Kings and
Princes submittinge their Regal crowns and scepters unto them. Finally
RELIGION; in that we devoutly honor God, who is gloriouse in his Saints, and
them also in that degree and honor which is fit for the excellency which
Almighty God has bestowed upon them: not truly to yield divine worship, to
their relickes or images. For we never heard of any that prayed thus: Holy
relics, holy images, save me, or pray for me: much less of any which did
attribute unto their relickes or images the work of our Redemption and
salvation, wrought only by CHRIST our mediator. But this mediation being once
wrought, we desire by the Saints intercession to have the virtue of Christ's
blood applied unto us by the bestowing of his graces and true repentance: no
otherwise than when we desire the same by the intercession of those which are
alive. Which S. Paul having used To. 15, 30. Ephesians. 6, ^. 1. These. 5, 25. 2.
These. 3, 1. Col. 4, 2. Heb. 13, 18. See page 69.
and the scripture commended, is free from all superstition and Idolatry, and
warranteth the like, toward those, which reigning with Christ, are more united
unto him, less care full of themselves, and more charitable unto us. And if
sometimes devout people use these words, S. Peter have mercy upon me, Of
these words S. Peter have mercy on me, S. Peter save me.
S. Peter save me: it must be understood in the true and lawful meaning which
it may have. For whereas mercy (as was See page 377.
said above) out of S. Augustine is a compassion in our heart of another man's
misery, whereby we are compelled to yield succor if it ly in our power: As God
may above all understanding show mercy, by giving grace grace and glory: so
may his Creaatures also according to their measure, by imparting unto others
that which they have received from the fountain of all goodness: Whether it
be in Temporal or Spiritual things, according unto that which has been
said Page 379.
above of both kinds of works of mercy. So likewise although Christ by his
blood be the chief author of our salvation: yet does he use Creatures as his
instruments. For so are we said truly to be saved by the 1. Cor. 15, 2.
Gospel, by Luc. 7, 30
Faith: by To. 8, 24.
Hope, by Tit. 3, 5.
Baptism: yea and sometimes by Men. If by any means I may save some of them:
To. 11, 14.
Says Saint Paul. And, 1. Cor. 7, 14.
How know thou woman if thou shall save thy husband. And again: Ibid. 9,
22.
To all men I became all things, that I might save all. Again: 1. Tim. 4, 16.
This doing thou shall save both thy self, and them that hear thee. And Saint
James: Iac. 5, 20.
He shall save his soul from death. Finally S. Jude. Iud. verse. 23.
And these, certes, reprove, being judged: but them, save, pulling out of the
fire. And on other have mercy in fear. Where he using both speeches of
saving, and having mercy: warranteth those which with true understanding and
Faith, in the earnest desire of their heart, do so utter their affections to
Gods holy Saints, Of kneeling to Saints.
without any intention of divine houour. Neither does kneeling before an Image
or Relicke betoken divine worship. For our body being so limited as it is: we
do by that very outward composition signify diverse honors in our mind,
and that lawefully: to our Parents, to Bishops, to Princes. Finally to God
and his Saints, always in our mind respecting the diverse duty: though the
external action be the same. The Heretics charge us with Idolatry, and all
their forefathers most grossly and unnaturally.
And here am I enforced to bewail the barbarous rudeness which HERESY has
brought our Country unto. For many shall you find, of al sorts of calling,
(though thanks be to God not of the ciuilest conditions) who will not stick
constantly to affirm that their forfathers kneeling, and knocking their
breasts, and using othet laudable acts of devotion before Images at holy
places: did verily think that those Images were Gods, and did absolutely power
out their prayers unto the Images themselves. A thing, in my opinion, that
argues in those which auouche it, a want not only of piety, but of all
ciuility. For if one called the Parents of these men Thieves; or Extorcioners,
or of vile and base conditions, void of Gentry and Nobility: then would they
storm and rage, and repute it an intolerable injury. And yet both they
themselves will resolutely think, and give others leave to suppose and say
the same, that their forefathers were Fools, and deprived of common sense and
understanding, which were as much as to call them Beasts in humane shape and
figure. And surely to thruste their ancestors out of Heaven (as they must
needs, if they think them Idolatours) were somewhat excusable: because God will
have mercy on whom he thinks good, and gives Heaven to a few whom he has
specially chosen: but to expel them from the participation of a common
understanding, whereby only man differs from beasts; is a thing altogether
intolerable, and a wonder, which none but unkind Heretics 2. Tim 3, 2
without affection (as Saint Paul calls them) could affirm.

And to worship Idolles, and to repute Creatures as Gods, when the faith of
one God which made Heaven and Earth, and the tidings of the Gospel was never
heard of: (although among the wiser sort of men none ever had such opinion: as
S. Augustine shows of Plato and Cicero) Lib. 8. ciu. cap. 6. and lib. 4. cap.
30. and 31.
yet was it in the common sort of people an humane frailty, whose
understanding darkened by Adams fall, could hardly arrive to any suspicion of
God, much less to a perfect knowledge of his Majesty. But what Brutishenesse
must there be in those, who having heard of Christ, and believing in him, and
knowing the articles of their Creed, and esteeming of Christ his Saints as his
frindes, and in Heaven gloriously reigning with him: yet must forsooth, of
necessity think their Images whom they reverence to be Gods? Since Christ's
coming, and the publishing of his Faith in the world: no Nation which
otherwise fell from Christ, returned to Idolatry: as may be seen in the
Turks: and yet the Church of Christ always professing his Faith, using his
Sacraments, keeping his Scriptures and Reading them, yea and Preaching him to
countries of Infidels, and converting them unto him: must be thought to have
most grieuousle have fallen of all other, into Brutishe ignorance and most
senseless Idolatrye. But this lamentation is more fit for the secret
chamber of the heart, humbling it self before GOD for the sins of his
people. This surely must I needs think, that they who thus esteem of the
beginners of their houses and families, are themselves void of all Nobility
and Ciuility, yea and all Humanity: only breathing by the proud spirit and
unsavory vapor of Heresy, sent forth out of the pit of hell. what honor we
yield to Relickes and Images.
But to the intent (gentle Reader) that thou may more pefectlie apprehend
the manner of worship which we yield unto Relikes and Images: Thou shall
understand that a Relicke may be considered in two manners. First as it is a
part of the Saint: And so, it deserves honor indeed, as has been showed
before: but less than the Saint himself; for that the whole is more perfect
than one part alone. And that which we have said of the part of the body, or
of the wholle body, which is a part of the wholle man: is also to be
understood of such exterior things as Vide 8. Thom. 3. p. qu. 25. art. 4.
and 6.
were any way belonging unto him, as his garments, and the instruments of his
Passion, or whatsoever reverend thing has touched his holy body: all which
deserve a certain affection of reverence, although less than the Saint
himself. For if in those whom we have naturally loved, we affecte after their
death (as Saint Lib. 1. ciu. cap. 13.
Augustine says) either their garment, or their ring, or any such thing, and
above all other things their bodies, which have been nearer unto them, than
any thing outwardly joined unto the^: how much more ought we to esteem of the
like things in Saints: and espeacially of their bodies which the same Doctor
calls instruments and Vessels which the holy Ghost has used to all good
works? And surely if a king could, when he would, leave off his hand, and
send it to his subjects abroad: no doubt but with great reverence it would
be every where received: espeacially if those which reverenced the hand did
know that the King did see them, and behold their dutiful shows of loyal
affection. Now certain it is that the Saints do see our reverend behavior
to their Relickes, and as for their bodies and parts thereof: we are assured
that now they be theirs, and their soul has a natural respect unto them, and
shall one day receive the^ glorified.

Secondly we may consider the Relickes, whatsoever they be, as they do
represent Chrysostom. in l. de S. Babyl.
unto us the wholle Saint, and are as it were certain Images of him. And in
this respect we must say the same which we generally hold of images: which
here I purpose briefly to set down.

Know thou therefore that an Image is honorable two ways. Images are
honorable two ways.
First when we stay in the Image it self, considering it as a venerable thing
for the similitude which it has with the Saint, and the consecration of it,
and dedication to a sacred use. After which manner we also yield a certain
holiness unto the holy BIBLE, and sacred CHALICES, and other holy things in
the Church. So was it defined in the seventh general Council holde^ at Action.
7.
Nice. And in this sense though the Church does yield reverence unto Images,
and that for the Saint his sake: yet the ordinary worship and devotion used
unto them by the faithful people, is not in this only respect exhibited and
showed. For when we kneel and pray before an Image of any Saint: we inte^d not
only to reverence a thing for his sake: But our meaning is, to yield honor and
to make our prayer unto the Saint himself, not staying in the Image alone.
And this is the second way of honoring an Image. That is, when that which we
do, we do not for to stay in the Image, but in the Image and by the Image we do
it unto him which is signified in the same. In the first we immediately honor
the Image, yet for the Saint himself: in the second, we immediately honor the
Saint by the Image and in the Image, without giving any honor unto the Image
it self, but only an accidentarie kind of honor. Even as he which honors
the King, honors his apparel and whatsoever belongs unto him, but only
accidentarilye: because he intends only to honor the person of the King.
The reason of this is: for that although I cannot think of the Image as it is
an Image, but I must needs think of that whose Image it is: yet thinking of
both, I may honor one only actually and expressly: though virtually and
consequently it redound to the honor of the other, as has been said.

Three examples will I give thee of this wholle matter. Thou see in a glass
thy own face: and yet yet thy face is not in the glass, but only an Image of
thy face: and yet may thou truly say thou see thy face, because the Image
is that only by which thou see thy face, and cannot properly be said to be
that which is seen it self, as the Philosophers teach: 3. Deanima
but that by which another thing is seen. Likewise as the Philosophers also
affirm: it is necessary that every one whilst he understands in this
life: form him self a fantasy or likeness of that thing which he
understands in his imagination. Now when thou in thy chamber where thou have
no Image, liftest up thy heart to CHRIST in heaven, and framest a likeness of
him in thy mind, and worshippest him, and praiest unto him: thou will not say
for fear of Idolatry (if thou art a Protestant) that thou honor that
likeness which thou have in thy brain: for that were to make to thy self a
God of a fantasy: but by that likeness, and in that likeness, thou
honor the true God. So is it, and no otherwise in our Images: which help
us to do that which our own imagination must needs do, though not so
perfectly without the Image. Thirdly thou honor the King whom thou see in
his apparel: so may thou conceive that the Saint is in a manner cladde in
the Image, and so pray unto him, conceiving him as present, though he be not in
deed but only by his virtue received from God. Finally, if thou will have one
example to declare unto thee both kind of honors due unto an Image: that is,
both because it is an Image like unto the Saint; and because in it and by it
thou honor the Saint: the like distinction may thou behold in an
Ambassador of a foreign Prince. Who sometimes represents actually the Princes
person: and then thou know with what solemnity he is entertained: other
times he does not actuallye represent his Princes person, but because he is one
expressly deputed to that end, to represent his Prince in time and place and
convenient business: he is still more than one of his degree, and though he be
of mean condition, yet is he my Lord Ambassador. Even so does an Image,
sometime actually represent the Saint: and when it does not, it is always a
reverend Image, naturally able to do the same, and by the Church deputed to
that end: and therefore more than ordinary wood, paper, and stone.

And all this honor which we have spoken of, is so far from blemishing the
honor due vnuo God, that it does the more increase and amplify it. Which Lib.
cont. Vigilant.
S. Hierome does very well express when he says. We do not worship or
adore (that is with divine worship, for so is his meaning) I say not the
Relickes of martyrs, but neither the sun, or moon, or Angels, or Archangels,
or Cherubin, or Seraphin, or any name which is named either in this life, or in
the world to come: least we should serve the creature, rather then the
Creator, who is blessed for ever. But we honor the Relickes of Martyrs, that
we may worship and adore him whose Martyrs they were. We honor servants,
that the honor of the servants may redound unto their Lord, who says: Mat.
10.
he that receives you receives me.

Thus much therefore against all Vigilantians, Eunomians and Iconoclastes, and
their spirits revived again in Lutherans and Caluinistes, for the defense and
propagation of Relickes and Images. Let us now return unto the titles of
PILGRIMAGE.

VI Pardons in holy paces.
Last of all, we may in PILGRIMAGE regard the holy Indulgences, granted unto
those which visitte the same places, by the governors of the Church. For
whereas Pardons are nothing else but an application of the Satisfactions of
Christ's wholle mystical body, that is, of himself and of his members, to
the releasing of the penalty of our sins remitted, as we will expound
hereafter: a singular cause of such application, besides the labor of the
journey, may be the visiting of such holy places where they suffered and do lie:
and so the effect thereof more large and undoubted.

Thus have we set down as plainly as we could and with as much briefnesse as
the matter would permit six reasons of Pilgrimage: none of which (such is
the force of verity, 3. Esd. 3, 18
which overcomes al things) any of our adversaries shall ever be able to
disprove. But least they think we deceive them by Philosophy and vain
fallacy (although we have indeed deduced all that we have said out of
scriptures and Fathers) Let us now see what we have expressly, concerning
Pilgrimage, in Scriptures and Fathers

II What have we in Scriptures and Fathers for the allowing of Pilgrimage?

NO better author of PILGRIMAGE can we either find or desire, than GOD
himself, who commanded that thrice a year Deuteronomy. 16, 16.
all the people should come to Jerusalem: or (before the Temple was built)
unto the Tabernacle. No better practisers of the same, tha^ Christ our Savior
Luc. 2, 41.
his Blessed Mother and Saint Joseph, by Gods own word approved Mat. 1, 19.
just: That we may say nothing of Helcana and 1. Reg. 1, 7.
Anna Samuells parents: of the Gentiles who are Io. 12, 20.
mentioned in the Gospel to come to Jerusalem to worship: and the Ethiopian
Eunuch Act. 8, 27.
whose devotion was rewarded with his Baptism and incorporation into Christ.
We have moreover an express Prophecy of Esaie Esa. 11, 10.
who of our Savior spoke thus: To him shall the Gentiles pray: and his
Sepulcher shall be gloriouse. No doubt but even to the worlds end, as S.
Hierome In ep. ad Marcell. vt migret Beth.
expounds, and experience shows. And if we well weigh this wholle matter:
we shall find that till our Savior CHRIST had wrought our salvation Ps. 33, 12.
in the midst of the earth (as the Prophet says) and the Apostles had shed
most gloriously their blood for testimony of Christ's Godhead: there were no
places of Christian PILGRIMAGES, no Mount CALVARIE, no Sepulcher of CHRIST, no
BETHLEHEM, no NAZARETH, Monumentes of the first beginnings of our Religion: nor
memories of holy MARTYRS Passions. Therefore must we not in Scriptures expecte
mention to be expressly made, of those things which were afterward done: but
sufficient it is if we have examples of the like, and Prophecies of the thing
it self, as fore we have showed, and may be also understood by those words
of David. Psalm. 131. Vide Hier. ep. 154. ad Desyderiu^. and ep 17. ad Marcell.
vt migret Beth.
We will adore in the place where his feet have stood. But after that Christ
had Sanctified those holy places, leaving so many testimonies of his love, as
there were steps which he did tread: and the Martyrs with their blood had
watered the wholle world, making it fertile with a new fruit: then began
indeed our Saviors Sepulcher to be glorious: then were the Martyrs honorablely
Entombed, and Religiously translated Greg. l. 3 ep. 30. Corn. ep. 1. Ruff. l. 2
c. 28. Hicelib. cont. Vigila^t Amb. inexhortat. ad Virgins. Aug. lib. 9. conf.

hist. Euagr. l. 1. cap. 16.
from place to place: then were their Bones enclosed in Aultars, and no place
esteemed fit for the public Sacrifice of the Church: but where there was
the memory of some Ambros. supr. 6. in ep. ad soror. de invent. SS. Ger. and
Prot. Hier. supr. Aug. ser. 11. de SS. Sozom. l. 5. c. 8. Conc. Carth. c. 14.
lively Sacrifice and Host offered up unto God. Finally, then was Pilgrimage
so frequented over the world, that it is a wonder, that any be found so
ignorant as not to know it: or so impudent as to disallowe it. And for the
places of Christ's appearing unto us: S. Hierome ep. 17. ad Marcel.
shall be a witness, not of his own opinion only, but of the practice of the
wholle world. The Jews in times past honored the Sancta Sanctorum, because
there were the Cherubin, and the Propitiatory, and the Arc, etc. Does not the
Sepulcher of our Lord seem unto thee more honorable? Which as often as we
enter into, so often do we see our Savior lie in the Sindon: and staying
there a while, we see the Angel sit at his Feet, and at his head the
Napkins wrapped together. The glory of whose Sepulcher, we know, long before
Joseph hewed it out, was foretoulde by the Prophecy of Esaie saying. Esa. 11.
And his rest shall be honor: because the place of our Lords Burial should be
honored of all men.

He afterward out of Saint Matthew Cap. 27.58
proves that the City of Jerusalem is holy, who expressly says, that
diverse going out of their graves, came into the holy City and appeared to
many. He alleges also that David commands us to woorshippe in the place
where the Feet of our Savior stood. And speaking against those which despise
Jerusalem, because our Savior was there Crucified: How do they (says he)
think the places blessed in which Peter and Paul the Captains of the
Christian Army for Christ did shed their blood! Rome holy.
If the profession of servants and of men be glorious: why is not the
confession of our Lord and God glorious? We every where reverence the
Sepuchers of Martyrs, and putting the holy Ashes to our eyes, if we may we also
touch them with our mouth. And do some think that the Sepulcher in which
our Lord was laid, is to be neglected? If we believe not our selves, let us
believe at the least the Devil and his Angels, Devils tormented at Christ's
Sepulcher.
who as often as before it they are driven out of possessed bodies, even as if
they stood before the Tribunal of Christ, they tremble, they roar, and are
aggrieued that they have Crucified him, whom they must fear. If after the
Passion of Christ, this place be detestable, what meante Paul to hasten to
HIERVSALEM, there to make Pentecost? What meante other holy and famous men,
whose devotions and offerings were after the preaching of Christ carried to the
Brethren at Jerusalem? Long were it now to run through every age since the
Ascension of Christ until this day, what Bishops, what Martyrs, what eloquent
men in Ecclesiastical Doctrine has come to Jerusalem, thinking that they
should have the less devotion, the less knoweledge, and no perfection of
virtues, except they had woorshipped Christ in those places, out of which the
Gospel from the Cross did first glisten. And there does he reckon up of all
Countries great multitudes of devout people, who with great zeal continually
came to visit those holy places, and grateful memories of our Redemption.

Saint Alexander Martyr, Eusebius. l. 6. c. 9. Vide Hier. in catal. in Alexandro.
100. years before Constantines time, made haste to Jerusalem that he might
woorshippe and see the holy places.

So did Saint Nicholas Simeon Metaph.
when he was a young man. And for that cause was Saint HELEN Eus. l. 3. de
vita Constant. and Amb. or. de obit. Theod
commended.

Saint Gaudentius Sermon. de dedic. Te^pl.
reports of himself, that he went in PILGRIMAGE to Jerusalem, and in the
way had given him Relickes of the 40. Martyrs.

Sulpitius L. 2. sacr. hist.
writes, that whereas the faithful coming from all places, did take of the
Duste of the place where our Savior Ascending into Heaven left the Printe of
his Feet: yet the Printe remained wholle. And these Vide Paulin. ep. 11.
Cassia. l. 4. de instit. renun. cap. 31. Socr. l. 7. c. penult. Pallad. in
hist. Laus. c. 113. and 118.
shall suffice for this point, that is, where immediately in Pilgrimage we
honor Christ.

Now for Pilgrimage to memories of Saints, we have first Saint Augustine who
Lib. 22. ciu. c. 8. Vide ep. 137.
reports of a Noble woman called Petronia (of whom we spoke before) who from
Carthage going to a town called Vzalis in Pilgrimage to Saint Steuens memory:
received miraculouslie her desired health. Which S. Augustine himself to the
glory of God caused to be recorded, and publikelie read: finding great fault,
and as himself says, almost chiding the Lady for that the memory of so great
a miracle through her silence had almost perished.

Saint Chrysostom prefers ho. 66. ad Antio.
the Sepulchers of Martyrs before Kings palaces. Because none go in Pilgrimage
to their houses: but they themselves go in Pilgrimage to Martyrs memories,
Where (says he) the Devils are whipped, men are corrected, and delivered. See
also his third Sermon upon S. Paul to the Romans, and in his fifth Sermon of
Saint Job how earnestly he desires the Pilgrimage to Rome to Saint Paul's
Body and Chains.

Saint Paulinus Natal. 3.
says that innumerable multitudes out of most far places came to S. Foelix his
body: as there did also to Nico in ep ad Mich.
Rome.

Saint Alexius went Metaph. in vita
in Pilgrimage to all the more noble Churches in the world.

Two Kings Beda. l. 5. c. 7. and 20.
of our Country, a thousand years since, went to Rome in Pilgrimage. See
Prud. de SS. Hemiter and Chelid. Paliad. in hist. Lausiac


Many more examples may be brought: but these do so evidently show the
general custom of the Primative Church, Conc. Cabil. 2. c. 45.
that we can desire no more.

Finally, what is the going to the Church every Holyday: but a short
Pilgrimage, used in every Village, Town and Country; so that speak our
adversaries never so much against Pilgrimages, they themselves practice them,
though unwittingly.

III What is to be thought of such as Vow Pilgrimages to holy places, and
offerings at the same?

OF Vows in general it has been spoken above. See page 77. and 206.
And in particular of this kind of Vows, there is no more to be said: but
that as the work it self is lawefull, Fulg. de fide ad Pet. cap. 3. quod scit
esse licitum and ad prosectum melioris vitae pertinere cognoscit: and libeater
voueat. and celeriter reddat.
and may commendably be done either to God immediately, or to him in his
Saints, whose honor redoundeth to his: so may it lawefully be promised either
to God or to his Saints. But such promises are now of a higher nature, than
those which are made unto mortal creatures, and be called Vows. Neither want
we examples of ancient times. S. Hierome exhorts one ep. 46.
Rusticus, who had sworn to visitte the holy places of Palestina: to make
haste to fulfill his Vow. Uncertain, says he, is the life of man, least thou
be taken away before thou fulfill thy promise, imitate her whom thou should
have taught: he means his wife, who had upon the like Vow or promise
vndertake^ already that journey: O shameful thing: (says he) the more frail
sex overcomes the world; and the stronger is overcome by the world. Tanti
Dux faemina facti: A woman is the ringleader of so great an exploite. Eudocia
Socr. l. ^. cap. penuit. (...) lib ^. cap. 21.
the Empress, wife of Theodosius the younger, twice undertook, but once Vowed
Pilgrimage to Jerusalem, enriching those holy places with many gifts. S.
Philoromus a Priest in hist. Laus. c. 113.
as witnesses Palladius twice by Vow went in Pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and
also by Vow to Rome, and to Alexandria where S. Marks body was.

Eusebius Lib. 13. Praep. cap. 7.
also reportethe the custom of the wholle Church in these words: We honoring
the soldiers of true piety, as the friends of God, do go to their monumentes,
and make Vows unto them as to holy men, by whose intercession we profess our
selves to be helped not a little.

The same Lib. 20. cont. Fausb. cap. 4.
custom was by the Maniches objected to Catholics, that we have turned
Idols into Martyrs, whom with like Vows we do honor: whence it seems that
the Caluinists have taken the like objection.

This custom of Vowing Pilgrimage, we have De SS. Hemit. 6. Chelid.
in Prudentius, and in Not. li. 1. 2. 4.
S. Paulinus. But most manifest is this place of Theodoret. That they which
pray deuoutely and faithfully, 8. Ad Gracos.
do obtain that which they desire: those things do witness, which for the
performance of their Vows, after they have obtained that which they Vowed for,
they do lea^e behind them. For some do hang v^golden or silver Pictures, of
Eyes, others of Feet, others of Hands. Where we have also an excellent
testimony for offerings: of which it follows now that we entreat.

These offerings are made in holy places for diverse respects. First, there are
certain tokens hanged up for a memory of a benefit received, as of life, of
health, or of any other thing which may virtuously be desired. And whether
these were after a solemn manner offered at the AVLYAH, or no: it skilleth
little: certain it is this end we may see by the place alleged out of
Theodoret to have been common in the Church. For he speaks of the custom of
the wholle Church, and against the Gentiles defends the general Faith. The
like we read of a certain Vessel, which having by Saint Bennets Greg lib.
2. dial. cap. 1.
prayers been made wholle after it was broken, was hanged up at the entrance
of a Church, for a memory. We have also testimonies of the Scripture, in which
we read, that Golias 1. Reg. 21, 9.
his Sword, and the Armor of Judith. 16, 23.
Holofernes were solemnly kept: as also the Censars Number. 16, 38.
of Dathan and Abiron by Gods appointment, as examples of Gods Justice showed
upon them. Neither was that ceremonious oblation of the Philistians which they
made to be delivered of their strange punishmente, rejected by the people of
God, because it was a testimonye of Gods glory. And they who being
miraculouslie benefited by Almighty God, do take up their bed, Mar. 2, 11. Io.
5, 9.
that is, hang up their Crouches, Chains, Fetters, from which they were
delivered. And they that with 1. Mac. 4, 57.
solemnitye do adorn the Temples and Churches for memory of some great grace
received: what do they else, but, as the Psalm says, render their Psalm. 115,
14.18.
Vows to God in the sight of al his people? Finally God himself commanded
Ios. 4, 8.
the Stones of Jordan to be solemnly kept, the Manna religiously to be
reserved: Heb. 9, 4. Exodus 16, 32.
and what did he not, to stamppe in the mind of his people, the memory of his
great works!

Sometimes these offeringes are made for Alms to the Ministers of holy places:
who it is meet should live of the 1. Cor. 9.13.
AVLTAR. Sometimes for other poor, maintained by the holy place, as
Hospitalles, Monasteries, Nunneries. sometimes to the building and ornament of
the Church. For these are worthily called offerings as witnesses Saint Paul,
To. 15, 31.
who calls the Alms sent to Jerusalem, an oblation. Neither is this a
Jewish ceremony to offer unto God for the sustenance of his servants, any thing
profitable to the use of man. For this was and is a thing appertaining to the
Law of nature, used and Vowed by Genesis 28, 20.
Jacob: and practiced in the Church of Christ, both in paying of Tithes and
other things also. But our Heretics thinking others as gross as themselves,
will needs have the people to have thought in times past, that those things
were profitable for the Images themselves: no otherwise than the people of
Babylonia was deluded in the service of Bell. Dan. 14, 10.
Which is a shameful slander, manifestly betraying the pride 2. Tim. 3, 2. 2.
Pet. 3, 18. Iudae verse. 16
of Heresy. But we contrariwise besides the manifoulde good which comes by
these offerings, as we have mentioned, can show the^ the reverend authority of
antiquity for such devotions in the Churches.

I find in ancient times, offerings to have been taken two ways. First, every
thing which was charitablely given unto the Ministers of God, or to his people,
was called an oblation. As we showed a little before out of S. Paul: and so
were immovable goods given to the Church, called Conc. Aurei. 3. c. 3. and
Conc. 4. cap. 14. and Conc. 1. cap. 17.
oblations. Secondly, there were certain things religiouslye offered in the
Church at the AVLTAR for the causes a fore-saide: that is, for the sustenance
of the poor, or of the Ministers of the Church, or to be applied to other
Charitable ends, according to the disposisition of the Bishop. So in the
Canons of Cap. 3. and 6. Synod. c. 28.
the Apostles are permitted offerings at the AVLTAR of new Corn, and new
Grapes. S. Augustine Ench. c. 110.
says, that the souls of the departed are relieved, when for them either the
sacrifice of the Mediator, or of whatsoever Alms is offered in the Church.
And that we may know that these Alms were offered not only in the Church,
but also at the AVLTAR: he makes mention in an other place of certain women
taken Ep. 122. ad Victor.
captives, whom he pitieth the more because, they could not carry their offering
to the Altar, being among Infidells. And in another place he Sermon. de co^.
vit. Cler.
says that he will not receive the offeringes of those which disinherite
their children.

He forbadde also the oblation of one Bonifacius Ep. 187.
to be received by his Clearkes. So does the 4. Council of Carthage at which
S. Augustine was present, Cap. 93. vide Conc. To. 11. c 4.
forbid the oblations of brethren which are at discord to be received, in the
Church, or into the Treasurehouse. As also in the next Canon, is rejected the
oblation of those which oppress the poor. S. Hierome Ep. 1. ad Heliod.
of Priests has this sentence. They live of the Altar; but unto me, as to an
unfruitful tree is the axe put unto the root, if I bring not my gift to
the Altar. So have we also in the aforesaid Council of Carthage mention of
the offeringes Carth. 4. cap. 95. vide Con. Vasen. 1. cap. 4. Agath. c. 3.
of the dead, which they had left in their wills to be made. And of the
manner of disposing of these oblations, diverse orders Conc. Began. cap. 7. and 8.
Hier. in ep. ad Dam. de oblationibus Altaris. Conc. Aurel. 1. c. 16. Calixt. 2.
and Dam. apud Great, 10. q. 1 Simplicius Papa ep. 3. Gelas. ep. 1.
have been taken in the Church, by diverse Counsels and holy Fathers. And the
yearly oblations for the dead of which we read in Tertullian, De cor. mil.
cap. 3 and de monog. cap. 10.
either must be the oblation of the sacrifice of the MASS, or this kind of
oblation in the Church of which we have spoken.

But more plainly to show this general custom of the Church: the very Acts
of the Apostles, seem to commend this kind of offerings. For when they brought
al to the Apostles feet: Act. 4, 35
what fitter place for such a religious action, than the Church? And when S.
Paul wills that on the 1. Cor. 16, 2.
Sondaies every one should lay up their devotion of Alms, where is it thought
more conveniently to have been done tha^ in the Church by these solemn
offerings? and that severe punishment of Ananias and Sapphira Act. 5, 5.
for deluding the Apostles in their oblation, may very well be deemed to have
been done in the Church, espeaciallye whereas we have such autorities for the
antiquities of offeringes, which cannot be thought to have proceeded but from
the Apostles themselves.

Five hundred years ago in a Council holden at Rome under De consocr. did.
1. c. omnis.
Gregory the 7. we have this decree. Let every Christian procure at the
solemnity of Mass to offer somewhat unto God, and to call to mind that which
God said by Moises. Exodus 23, 15. Deuteronomy. 16, 17
Thou shall not appear in my sight empty. For in the Collectes of of holy
Fathers it manifestly appears, that all Christians ought according to the
custom of holy Fathers, to offerre something to God. Whereby we gather the
custom to have been far more ancient than this decree.

what things were offered in the Primitive Church
Now what things were in ancient times offered, is not hard to be gathered.
For first it is not unlikely that those suppers which were made sometimes in the
Church, sometimes near unto the Church, for the poor, and were called 1. Cor.
11, 20. Conc. Gang cap. 11. Laod. cap. 27.28. Tert. apol. c. 39. Chry. ho. 27.
in 1. Cor. See the Rhemes Test. upon 1. Cor. 11, 20.
Agapae (as it were charities) were comprohended amongst other offerings: which
seem to have remained until S. Augustins time, who brings as an objection
of Faustus, that Lib. 20. contr. Faust. c. 20. etc. 4.
the Catholics had converted the sacrifices of the Gentiles into Agapes.
Which Agapes as may be gathered out of S. Augustine were both of fruit and of
flesh, and of all ordinary food of man. And being in use in Africa, his
mother in Milan attempting Lib. 6. conf. cap. 2.
to practice it at the memories of Martyrs, as she had done at home, was by S.
Ambrose forbidden, not because it was evil: but because there the custom of
such banqueringe in the Church was abrogated.

Secondly we find that sometimes in the Church the faithful people Conc.
Affric. c. 4.
offered honey and milk, which was upon Easter Eve, on which day to those that
were baptized, were those two things given, or in some places wine and milk as
witnesses S. Hierome In Esa. 55. and dial. contr. Lucif.
and Tertulliam Tert. l. 1. con. Marc.
Sometimes we read of offering of corn and grapes as we have touched above.
Last of all we find that the people solemnly offered bread and wine for the
sacrifice: of which S. Cyprian Sermon. de Eleemosyn. Justin. apol. 2. vide Greg.
4. dial. c. 55.
speaking to some negligent rich women; says after this manner. Thou come
into the Church without sacrifice and take part of the sacrifice which the
poor has offered. Of which also there is a commandment extant of Fabian
Fab. ep. 3
the Pope. That every Sunday as well by men as women there should be an offering
of bread and wine, that by these offertnges they might be delivered from the
bands of their sins. Which decree also is read in the Council Cap. 4. See
before of Alms page 372.
of Matisco. Whereby we may learn what effect the ancient Fathers attributed
unto these offerings. As generally Vrbanus the Epist. 1.
first a most ancient Pope, calls the^ the Vows of the faithful, the
prices of their sins, the patrimony of the poor, things given and dedicated to
God. Yet now the custom of offering other things is ceased: and the people
remaining bound to no ordinary oblation, there being other sufficient
provision for the sacrifice, does voluntarily offer in the sacrifice of the
MASS either money, or candells.

Now therefore what do our adversaries reprehend in offeringes? the giving of
Alms? but what is more commended in scripture than Alms? the offering it in
the church? where ca^ the members of Christ be more decently relieved, than in
the house of CHRIST? The solemninity of the offering? but that does put us in
mind to whom we do it, rectify our intention, edify the wholle congregation,
and honor Almighty GOD. The doing it for the honor of a Saint? then may it
be done even by their consent to the honor of Christ immediately: and so
offerings may be made solemnly but not to Saints. But we have learned above,
that Saints both may be and are to be honored. See page 68.
As also we have showed of Images according to the true meaning and intention
of the Church. So that they cannot in reason deny, but offerings may be made
before an Image, and by that Image to the Saint. Unless they will yet deny
that we may honor Saints at all: to which point we are not now to return
largely to discuss the same: only I will desire them to call to mind that
Saint Paul writing to the Philippians Phil. 2, 2.
desires the^ to fulfill his joy, that they be of one meaning, having the same
charity, of one mind, agreeing in one etc. Now if S. Paul wills them and so
earnestly entreats them as may be seen in the epistle it self to fulfill his
joy whilst here he lived: by serving of God in all manner of perfection: why
may not S. Paul now require the like? or if they cannot yield that S. Paul has
so much traficke with us as to demand our duetifull behavior toward
Almighty God, for his joy: why may not any devout person of his own
accord, seek now to fulfill S. Paul's joy in any manner of good and lawful
action? therefore if I will love God: why may I not say: I will love God to
fulfill S. Paul's joy? likewise I will Fast, to fulfill S. Paul's joy: I will
pray, to fulfill S. Paul's joy: I will go to the Church to fulfill S. Paul's
joy: and (that which belongs to our offerings) I will offer this alms for
the ornament of Gods Church, maintaining of his Ministers or releeuing the
poor, and this to fulfill S. Paul's joy, before whose Image I do it, in whose
Church and by whose intercession I hope my prayers shall be accepted: and last
of all since that God will have his Saints whom he honors him self, Esth.
6, 9. Genesis 41, 43.
to be honored of all: why may I not without any superstition say: I will
honor S. Paul; for to fulfill S. Paul's joy? For as God himself deserving al
kind of honor, and glory, does justly seek that which is due unto him, and
therefore he says Esa. 42, 8.
I will not give my glory to another: So is there nothing more conformable to
his holy will, or of his Saints who always agree thereunto: tha^ that to the
Saints be yielded that honor which God has imparted unto them: according to
that of S. Paul: To. 13, 7
To whom honor, honor. So that without all doubt by honoring S. Paul, we may
fulfill S. Paul's joy. The same Apostle in like manner says: Phil. 4, 1.
Therefore my dearest brethren and most desired, my joy and my crown: so stand
in our Lord my dearest. The Philippians therefore were S. Paul's joy and
crown, for the gloriouse pains which he had taken amongst them, for his
notable examples, and continual preaching. And is not S. Paul's. Doctrine yet
extant? are not his examples lively? do we not still reap the fruits of his
labor? Therefore if the Aungells do conceive joy Luc. 15, 7.10.
of a sinner repentinge, whose conversion cost them no sweat, no labor, no
torments: shall not S. Paul reioise at the fruit springing from his iorneis,
from his writings, from his Passions? and if he shall: may not I desire the
same? and if I may desire it, may I not offer it; and wish the increase of his
joy, which I know he must needs have by such works done by his exhortation,
or for his imitation? and what other works can we do, or use we to do to the
honor of a Saint: then in doing a work acceptable to God, to desire that God
be sanctified in that Saint, and to delight in the glory and honor of that
Saint, being ready as much as in us lies if it were possible, to augmente
Gods glory and his Saints felicity, which in effect is no more, than to say
as Christ as taught us, Sanctificetur nomen tuum: Hallowed be thy name. But
these men with whom we deal, and against whom we dispute, as they have
malitiouslye given the people to understand, that we honored dumme stocks and
stones in steed of Saints: so have they as blasphemouslye endeavored to
persuade, that the Saints themselves in heaven be in effect nothing but
dumme and deaf stocks and stones; taking way from them all knowledge of our
estate, and all communication of them with us, and of us with them, as though
we were not members of one body, or as though they were not intelligent
souls, now not depending of their bodies, nor requiring ears or eyes or
nearenes of place to hear or see our affairs: Finally so depriving them of al
honor, that if they were here amongst us, even as gloriouse as they are in
heaven: yet would they neither vouchsafe them cappe nor knee. But we will
conclude this point of Vows and offerings with one sentence of the Isa. 19, 21
Prophet commending unto us both together: who speaking of the law or Christ
says: They shall worship him in sacrifices and in gifts, and shall make Vows
to our Lord, and pay them. And we truly know that what is done unto Gods
Saints is performed in the^ to God him self.

IIII How shall we answer those which repute these Ieweish Ceremonies?

THere is one common refuge, which because it is used by Heretics as a
lurking corner not only in this matter, but also in many others: we must
needs dispossess them of. For if we dispute of Priests, of Sacrifice, of
Aultars, of Holiedaies, of Vows, of Holy Water, and infinite other things:
they presently run to the Law of Moises, and say that those things were
lawefull in that estate: but that to use them in the Law of grace, were to
return to Ieweish ceremonies. So that in this manner they smothely shifte
themselves of all places of the old Testament, and withal cast a great miste
before the eyes of the simple, as though indeed we tied them to those old
figures and shadows of things to come, whereas now the work of our
Redemption is fulfilled. And yet on the otherside, it is a wonder to see, how
these enemies of Ieweish ceremonies make us still subject to the yoke of the
Law, denying unto the children of GOD the sufficiency of Gods grace to fulfill
the same, still leaving us our old stony Ezech. 36, 26. et. 11, 19.
heart, which GOD did once mollify, by his spirit sent amongst us To. 8.4.
To. 6, 17.
when he condemned sin, that the Justification of the Law might be fulfilled
in us. Which which indeed is clean to take away Christian liberty. God grant
that in time it grow not to an open profession as well in deeds, as some of
their MASTERS have uttered in words, that the Luther very often has affirmed
it. See Conc. Trid. sess. 6. c. 19.
10. Commandments belong not to a Christian, and so to a general liberty of
al licentiousness. Understand therefore (good Reader) that there were three
kind of Laws Deuteronomy. 4, 13.14. et. 6.1
unto which all the oulde Law may be reduced. For there were Ceremonial.
Judicial, and Moral Laws. The first consisted in matters appertaining to
their religion: The second, in the particular Laws of policy and civil
government of that country: The third, in the very Law of nature common to
them and to al mankind, which was wholly comprised in the 10. Comaundements.
For the 10. Commandments Iren. lib. 4 ^. 31. and 32. Tert. lib. de idolat.
Aug. lib. 15. cont. Faust. cap. 4 and 7. lib. 19. c. 18. lib. 3. cont. 2. ep.
Pelag. cap. 4.
contain only the Law of nature, except that of the Sabbath: which although it
were partly natural in that we are bound sometime even by the Law of nature
religiously to honor God: yet the determination of one day in a week, or of
one day more than another was ceremonious, and therefore now changed into
Sunday. Now certain it is, that the Law of Moises is Heb. 7, 12. 2. Cor. 3,
7.
abolished and euacuated, and being fulfilled by Christ our Priest, has given
place to a new Law, and to a new Priesthood. Wherefore of these three kind
of Laws, the first and second do not bind at al: the third binds, but not
as the Law of Moises; but as the Law of God, written long before it, was
given unto Moises To. 2, 15.
in every man's heart: and as the Law of our new Lawemaker, renueing those same
commandments in SION Esa. 2, 3.
and in Jerusalem; the other of Gal. 4, 30.
Sina being cast out. But although the other two kinds do not bind us at
all: yet are they not fully both a like. For the judicial Laws truly may be
indifferently by any country accepted as Laws to bind that country. As it
may by Parliament be agreed that Adulterers Io. 8, 5.
be stoned, that Exodus 21, 24. Deuteronomy. 19, 20
an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: that is, that the accuser which is
notable to prove a crime objected, be punished with that punishment which he
would have procured for the other, and that he which maimed another, Vide
Joseph lib. 12. antiq. cap. 13. and Instit. de injurijs paragr Poena.
be himself maimed in the same member. And the reason of this is, because GOD
being the most wise Lawemaker which may be, and the most skillful of all
equity and justice: there can be no doubt but that Civil Law which was by
him made and given to his people, may justly (if so it seem good to the Rulers
and Magistrates) be brought into the custom of any other Country. And so
although pilferinge Thieves be now hanged in our country, as in others: yet
may we bring in for the^ a more mild punishment, that so they be not put to
death any more, as they were not Exodus 22, 1. vide Authe^t. col. 9. constit 134.
in Moises Law: and yet not Iudaise: So long as we do not observe it as a
Law by Moises established, but only binding us for the general consent of
those who may make Laws in our country: after which manner in our country we
do still retain the Judicial Law of Tithes: Tua nos de decimis.
as also the prohibition of Marriage in certain degrees, which by the Law of
nature were not forbidden. True it is, that 1. Cor. 10, 11.
every thing happened unto the Jews in figure: for as much as the wholle state
of that people, was figurative of things to come: but the principal end of
these judicial Laws was the peaceable politic government of their country,
and so used by us with that intent and not to figure Christ as to come, or
accepted as from Moises his authority now abolished: as we have said: they
are no doubt lawful and good. Thus much of the judicial Laws. But among the
ceremonial Laws, some indeed there were, which had no other relation to
signifi, e Religion but only in respect Aug. ep. 19 ad Hier.
of Christ to come: as circumcision Sancta Sanctorum, and bloody sacrifices:
which signified the death of Christ, and the circumcision of our hearts, which
he by his blood was to procure. And these to practice and allow, is most
detestable, and Gal. 5, 2.
a disanulling of the faith of Christ. Other ceremonies there were which
although they might in that people signify things to come in the law of
Grace: yet, this was not their proper nature, but only in respect that they
were in that people, whose state was nothing but a figure. For of their own
nature Vide Leonem ser. 7. de ieiun. 7 mensis.
they had in them selves a moral goodness and did signify a subjection
toward God, and gave ornament and comeliness to his service. And these so long
as they be not taken as binding by the force of the old Law, but only brought
from thence, as proportionable both to the natural duty we owe to God, and
fit for the better order in matters of religion which S. Paul commends 1.
Cor. 14, 40.
may be and always have been used in the Church. Such are the ceremonies of
Churches, Aultars, Candells continuallye burning in the Churches, Offeringes,
Churching of women, and abstaining from servile works upon the Sunday. for in
this respect of working, that Commandment was ceremonious. For certain it is
that we may honor God although we work. And so we see among Christians that
ceremony not to be kept in such rigor as it was by the Jews: because the
Church renewing that ceremony, only forbids servile works, but not
travailing nor riding, and consequently not the labor of beasts and such like.

To conclude all therefore in few words: the Aug. ep. 8.9.19. Hier. ep. 89.
Law of the Jews (in as much at it is Ceremonial and Judicial, is Mortua,
that is, Dead: for to use the word of holy doctors: for that it binds not.
But it is not Mortifera and perniciosa: that is, deadly, or bringing death to
those which use the particular Laws thereof; but in respect of such ceremonies
which are not founded in the very Law of nature, but only instituted either by
Moises, or before his time, to signify Christ as yet to come. Such are not
kneling in prayer, lifting up of hands or eyes, knocking of the breasts, and
finallye that which we spoke of, Voweing and Offering. Which may evidently be
proved, for that it was the general custom of all nations, in which has at
any time been the honor of the true God, and is read in the Scripture to have
been used by Genesis 28, 20.
Jacob, before Moises. And for more confirmation of this, let it be
considered, how the very Apostles of Christ retained Act. 15.
and necessarily imposed upon Christians the Ceremony of abstaining from blood
and strangled: yet not to be observed as having the force of a Law from
Moises: whereas they expressly say that themselves impose it:) But only for a
charitable knitting See Saint (Augustine and Saint Hierome of this matter.
together of the Gentiles and Jews, who for their long custom at that
beginning would abhor those meats which they had before esteemed as
unclean.

Let it therefore remain, that these things above spoken of, neither are
Jewish ceremonies but common to al true Religions of all ages: and if they had
been Jewish; yet might they having no necessary signification of our
redemption as to come; be holesomely instituted and commanded by Christ his
Church. S. Tho. par. 3. qu. 60 artic. 3.
I say of our Redemption to come: For we in our Ceremonies and Sacraments for
the most part have three manner of significations: of things past, of things
present, and of things to come. Our sacraments signify the death of Christ as
past: the grace of God by them presently wrought in our souls: and everlasting
glory the effect of Gods grace which in time shall be revealed in us.

So CANDELS burning in the Church, even in the daytime, especially at the
Gospel, do signify the light of the Gospel Io. 1*
brought into the world by Christ: the light of grace shining in the hearts of
the lively members of Christ: and the everlasting light of Heaven. So
Holy Water puts us in mind of the washing away of our sins by Christ his
death, applied unto us in BAPTISM: signifies the present washing of our
Soul, which we ought to procure by contrition of heart: and the perfect
washing away of al filthes when God shall bring us being purged from all
iniquity into Apoc. 21, 27. Psalm. 23, 4. and 14, 2.
his holy place, where none can be received but he that has innocent hands,
and a clean heart. So may we discourse of other holy ceremonies used in Gods
Church. And it is no marvel though in our state we have some figure of things
to come. For 1. Cor. 13, 10.
we have not as yet attained to that which is perfect, but only to that which
is in part: now we walk by Faith, and as it were we see by a glass in a
dark sort: but not yet in likeness face to face. Wherefore Christ himself by
his rest in the Sepvlcher, signified the rest of Heaven: and although the
Sabbath be taken away: yet have we the celebration of the Sunday Aug. lib. 22,
ciu. c. 30. and ep. 119.
signifying the blessedness of Heavenly rest. The reason of this is, because
of all those things which Christ caused and deserved by his Passion: some are
now fulfilled: as the price of our redemption, and the benefits of Gods grace,
Faith, Hope, and such like things: but yet there remains the principal, which
is, Judgment and Glory. Wherefore meet it was that those Ceremonies which
signified all those things as to come should cease: and othere should be
ordained which might both signify the benefits already obtained, and nourishe
our hope with the representing of the good things to come: which being once
had, all ceremonies shall cease. As S. Ihon did insinuate Apo. 21, 22.
unto when he said. And a Temple I saw not in it, for our Lord God Omnipotent
is the Temple of it and the Lamb. And those which now mislike the Churches
ceremonies and orders unless they repent (which God grant) shall not only be
without ceremonies, but with out all order and with Job 10, 22
sempiternall horror and confusion.

V What testimony have we of Candells burning before Saints Relics or
Images, in places of Pilgrimage?

BEcause we have hitherto defended offeringes at the memories of Saints, and
one most ordinary offering is a burning Candell: it is necessary that we
speak somewhat hereof. If any ornaments be convenient for the House of God,
as both the light of natural reason and the example of the old testament does
teach: Exodus c. 25. and sequ. Number. 7. 1. Par. 28. and 29. 2. Par. 3. and 4. and
5.
there cannot be found or conceived, any either more excellent or more
fit, than the ornamente of lights, or Candells. The first thing which GOD
made was light: Light is a quality which bewtifieth all things, and of nothing
can be defiled: it is so nere unto a spiritual nature, that it is only amongst
all divisible accidents produced in a moment: nothing more swift tha^ light,
nothing more pearcing: whereas it penetrateth most thick bodies, as of
Crystal, glass, Ise, yea and the very heavens which as Job Job. 37, 18.
says be solid and firm as if they were forged of brass. The Aegiptians who
did with forceable likenesses express every thing: by the light of a Lamp
represented life: whereas Life the most pretiouse thing in this world is
nourished by natural humiditie, as the most excellent quality of the light,
is conserved by oil. Yea in all civil conuersations there is a kind of civil
reverence yielded unto light, when at the bringing in of light we use to
salute one another. And that which is most to be wondered at; those which are
not ashamed of any vice or filthiness, yet ordinarilye are as it were ashamed
of light: and being never so solitary, yet are desirous not to have so pure a
witness of their impurity. So that even literally we may say as our Savior
has said: Io. ^.^^.
He which does evil hates the light. But how if we should run over the
wonderful dignities and excellencies attributed unto Light in holy scriptures:
we should far exceed the limittes of our intended brevity. God him self
^^o. ^, 5.
is Light: his 1. Tim. 6, 16.
House where he dwells is Light; his Law Pro. 6, 2^
is Light; his word Ps. 118, 10^.
is Light; his Ps 103, 1
garments are Light; his Heb 1, 7.
Angels are Light; his Apostles Mat 5, 11.
are Light; Finally his Io. 12, 36.
servants are children of Light; as contrariwise the servants of
iniquity, do continually Io. 8, 12 and 3, 19.
walk in darkness, because they love darkness more than light.

Now if Heretics cannot abide Light in Gods Churches; what marvel? for
what society is there between light and darkness? 2. Cor. 6, 14.
they have forsaken the Light of Gods Church, which although it stand Mat. 5,
14.
upon a hill; they will not see; they seek to cover Gods truth under Ibidem
verse. 16.
a bushel: they carry about with the^ the eyes of an owl, which being more
familiar with the darkness of the night, then the glorious beams of the
Church, which is chosen as Cant. 6, 8.
the Sun; cannot open themselves to behold the truth. GOD grant that once
having cast away their stubborn wilfulnes, they may know themselves miserably
to have conuersed so long in a more horrible hole and dongeon Dial. 7. de repub.
then was that of Plato, where seeing nothing but false shadows of things,
they nevertheless condemn and hate those which go about to open unto them the
true light, and procure as much as in them lies that their Aegiptian darkness
being cast away in this life, they may escape the 2. Pet. 2, 17.
mist of darkness reserved for such as persist in their estate, in the other.

For we have in this point of the use of Lights in the Church, testimonies of
scriptures and of Fathers. Scriptures, in that we read God himself to have
ordained perpetual Light in his Exo 25, 31. and 27, 20 3. Reg. 7, 49.
Temple. And amongst the Fathers: first S. Chrysostom says: In Litur.
that the Priest goes to the Altar, his Minister going before him with
Light: The Acolites Conc. 4. Carth. c. 6. Isid lib. 7. etym. c. 12. Ordo Romans
Microl. c. 11.
office was always in the Church to light the Torches in the MASS time at the
Gospel and at the oblation.

To which S. Augustine in the Council of Carthage gives witness. And least
any should think this to have been only in the night: certain it is that
according to the ancient custom of the Church: MASS was never Walfrid. cap.
23.
said in the night, except thrice in the year. That is upon Telesph. ep. ad
vniu. cap. 2. Leo. ep. 79. vel. 81. c. 2.
Christmasse-Nighte Maundy-Thursday and Easter-Eue at night: for at other times
it was not ordinarily begone before the third hour of the day. Wherefore those
Torches of which S. Athanasius Epist. ad omnes Orthod.
makes mention, when he charge the Arians with sacrilege, for offering the
torches of the Church unto Idols: were no doubt such as in the time of MASS
and speacially at the Gospel even in the midst of the day were lighted, as
also Contr. Vigil.
Saint Hierome does affirm.

Now if lights are fit ornaments for a Church: tha^ may they adorn the
memories of Saints, and be set before Relickes and Images, in sign of joy of
the Saints glory: to put us in mind of the light of grace, and glory brought
into the world by Christ, professed and preached by them: to stir us up to
such a kind of life, as may (no otherwise than in them) shine to al me^, to
the glory of God: finally for a certain honor to the Saints themselves. But
of this matter we will hear S. Hierome speak, Contr. Vigil. Vigilantius his
objection against Lights.
who propounding Vigilantius his objection in this same matter, says. We see
almost the custom of the Gentiles under pretense of Religion to be brought
into the Church: that whilst the Sun does shine, great heaps of torches are
kindled: and wheresoever there is I know not what duste, enclosed in a little
Vessel, and covered with some precious cloth: they kissing do worship it.
These men forsooth yield great honor to most blessed Martyrs, who they think
may be lightened with filthye torches, whereas the Lamb which is in the midst
of the throne, with all brightness of his Majesty does lighten them. This
spoke Vigilantius: how like unto the Caluinistes of our time: the Reader shall
judge. Now S. Hierome answers it so, that we may perceive that his opinion
was that Candels were never set before Relickes but in the night, when the
people were come together to watch at the memories of Saints, upon their
Eues. And that then it was only done for that necessity, not for any honor to
the Saint. Not that S. Hierome did not acknowledge honor to be due unto
Relickes, for as we have said before: in this very book against Vigilantius,
he constantly avouches it: but because he had not as yet been co^uersant in
places where this kind of honor was showed unto the Saints. For if he had
ever seen it used in the day: than must it needs have been for a sign of
joy and honor to the Saints, which he here denies to have been the intent
of the Church. Yet that this custom was in other parts of the world, far from
S. Hierome, as in SPAIN and FRANCE, where Vigilantius lived: we may gather
manifestly, both by his objection, and out of others who^ we will allege. Yea
S. Hierome himself, although he seem not to acknoweledge any general custom
of the Church in this point: yet does he commend the zeal of who soever might
perchance in some place use the same, even to honor Saints thereby;
comparing their devotion to that of MARY MAGDALEN, when she powered the
ointmente upon our Savior, and was by him defended from Judas his hypocrisy.
So whosoever does light torches (says he) has a reward according to his
faith. Whereas the Apostle says: Let every one abound in his own sense.
These men do thou call Idolaters? We al (I confess) which do believe in
Christ, came forth of the error of Idolatry. For we are not made Christians by
birth, but by regeneration. And because we once worshipped Idolles, must we not
now worship God, least we may seem to worship him with the like honor with
which we worshipped Idolles? That was done unto the Idols, and therefore must
be detested: this is done to Martyrs, and therefore must be admitted. For
even where there are no Relickes of Martyrs, in all the East-Churches, when the
Gospel is to be read, Lights are kindled, even the Sun shining, not to drive
away darkness, but to show a token of joy. Wherefore those Virgins Mat. 25.
of the Gospel have always their Lamps burning: And to the Apostles it is
said: Let your loins be Luc. 12, 35.
girded, and burning Candels in your hands. And Io. 5, 35.
of John Baptist: He was a Candle burning and shining: that under the type of
corporal light, that light may be showed, of which we read in the Psalter:
Psalm. 118, 104.
A Candell unto my feet is thy word, O Lord, and a light unto my paths. Thus
far Saint Hierome.

Theodoretus Lib. 5. cap. 30.
reports of the translation of Saint Chrysostoms body made in his time: in
which the whole mouth of the strait called Bosphorus: was covered with
candels burning, the boats being so many that the sea seemed to be firm land.

The same Ibidem cap. 34.
Author testifies the like honors to have been showed to that Saint in his
life, when in the same place the people met him with burning torches at his
return from banishement.

Saint Paulinus Natal. 3.
gives testimony of many Candels, burning night and day, before S. Faelix his
body.

In S. Peter's Church at Lib. 3. dial. c. 24.
Rome, burned a Lamp continually, as witnesses S. Gregory.

And Lib. 7. ep. 2 cap. 1^.
Germanus the Patriarch of Constantinople, reports the like devotion to
Images.

S. John Damascen 3. De Imag.
writes of Lights before S. Simeons Image.

In the history Vide hist scrip. a Constantino Porphyr.
also of the Image of our Savior at Edessa, of which we spoke before: we
read of a Candel burning before it.

In vita Siluestr.
Finally Constantine the great, offered to the Relickes of SS. Peter and Paul
many Candel-sticks, and ordained that there should be maintained many Lamps
continually burning. The like unto which is to be seen in a Donation made by
Saint Gregory to Saint Peter's Church in Rome: which being cut in Marbell
from very ancient time is now extant in the Porch.

These things therefore, and many other which might be brought do evidently
show that which we purposed. That is, that as al other Ceremonies be holesomely
observed in the Church, to represent unto us the benefits of God, and to show
our duty and subjection toward him: So also this of Candels is most
profitablely retained: to show our joy and exultation in Christ: to represent
unto us the light of Heaven: to put us in mind of the light of the grace and
Gospel of CHRIST; to stir us up to walk like the children of light: finally,
(that which is an invincible argument) to See Saint Hierome cited before.
show us that in an external sign: of which the Scripture yields us so many
signs in writing. For as we may by reading the Scriptures, put the people in
mind of these excellent significations of light: so may we also by showing
the thing it self, after a reverend and solemn manner, admonish them of the
same light, and stir them to a deep and earnest consideration of their
duties: Whereas writings are but signs of the things themselves: and as a
Heathen Poet says. Segnius irritant animos demissa per aures, quam quae sunt
oculis subiecta fidelibus. Ho^at. in art Poet.
More slowly do those things move the mind which are heard, than those which
are seen.

VI How is it void of Heathenish superstion, that we ask in Pilgrimages
diverse things of diverse Saints.

THis is another objection of our adversaries, whereby as before they charged
us with Iudaisme: so now because the Heathens used ceremonies, oftentimes not
unlike to ours: they infer, that we are professors of Paganism. But this
was long since answered by See page 605.
Saint Hierome cited here immediately before, when he said, that for the same
reason we must not worship God, because the Gentiles used to worship their
Gods. And That was done says he, to Idolles and therefore must be detested:
This is done to Martyrs, and therefore is to be admitted. The like also does
Lib. 20 cont. Faust. cap. 21.
S. Augustine answer to Faustus, reprehending the honor of Martyrs, as though
we made the^ Idols: For, says he, we must not therefore contemn and detest
the Virginity of NVNNES, because there were in times past Virgins consecrated
to Vesta. Whence it proceeds that the Gentiles superstitions were like to
holy ceremonies.
True it is, that the devil who ever since the beginning has had a desire to be
like the highest: has always studied to transfer the rites and ceremonies
of Gods people to his abominable Idolatries. So witnesses the holy Scripture,
1. Match. 3, 48.
reporting that in the time of the Machabees, out of the sacred books of the
Law, the Gentiles did search out a similitude of their Idolles.

So also witnesses Lib. de perscript.
Tertullian. Hence was it, that as the same Tertullian affirms, the Gentiles
had many superstitions, much-like unto our Sacraments: as a kind of
Baptism, and a certain mystical Bread: taken no doubt from the Jews; whose
waters of expiation, and bread of proposition, gave the Gentiles occasion of
an Apishe and Sacrilegious imitation. Now what marvel, if the Jews
Ceremonies being so like ours, as that they were purposely instituted to
presignifie them: the Gentiles superstitions imitating the Jews, do somewhat
also resemble our holy Ceremonies? Whereas hereof it must needs follow which
Lib. 20. cont. Faust. cap. 21.
Saint Augustine says: that as the Jews religion was A foretelling
prefiguration of our truth: so the Gentiles must be An erroneous imitatio^ of
the same. Such kind of reasoning therefore, by which our Ceremonies are
condemned, for the Gentiles using the like: is to be hissed at: and answer is
to be made, with Saint Augustine Ibidem.
that as in Virginity it much imports, to whom it is Vowed and performed;
whereby our NVNNES differ form the Vestalles: so also do the outward
Ceremonies of Gentiles, far differ from ours in their contrary end and
intention: they being to the honor of the Devil; and ours to the honor and
exaltation of Gods holy name. Now for the matter it self. We may ask every
thing of every Saint.
True it is, that to ask one thing particularly of one Saint so that we think
that the Saint cannot as well obtain all: (whereas the Saints give nothing of
themselves, but by their intercession obtain of God whatsoever he himself is
able to give, which is every good and perfect gift:) were a superstition much
to be condemned, and utterly to be banished from all Christian minds. For
after this manner had the Gentiles Gods for every thing, whom they had so tied
to their several duties and taskes: that the Goddess of the Aug. l. 4. ciu.
cap. 8. and 21.
corn yet under the earth could not meddell with the same now sprung: nor she
that had the charge of the corn in the field, could take the protection
thereof in the barn: and such other infinite follies. But among Christians
never was there any such opinion, but that of any Saint one might ask any
gift or benefitte lawful to be asked or looked for from God. We ask one
thing of one Saint rather than of another.
Yet has there been and there is also a laudable and Godly custom: of one
Saint to ask one thing espeacially, and of another to demand another: not
for any imbecility in other Saints: nor for any imperfection in that Saint to
whom we pray: but for diverse Godly and lawful causes: as here we will declare.

Paul commands 1. Cor. 4, 16. and 11, 1. Phil. 3, 17. 1. These. 1, 6. 1.
These. 2, 14 2. These. 3, 7. Heb. 6, 12. and 13, 7.
that we imitate him and other Saints. Now certain it is that there be
divisions of Graces, 1. Cor. 12
God giving to every one as he wills. Every Saint excels in some one
gift or other: wherefore the Church applies that sentence of the
Ecclesiasticus spoken particularly of Abraham, to every Bishop and Confessor,
and consequently to every Saint: Eccles. 44, 20.
There was not found any like unto him. So that of so many diversities of
infinite Saints unlike one to another in the mesure of graces, yet tending all
to the end of the love of God: there arises that bewtifull Psalm. 44, 10.
orname^t of the spouse of Christ, exceedingly delighting his heavenly eyes,
and those Io. 14, 2.
diverse Mansions in Gods house agreeable to their diverse deserts. Now then
what absurdity can there be if for patience; I pray to Job: for Faith; to
Abraham: for fervor in Prayer; to Elias: for tears of Penance, to Mary
Magdalen: for charitable diligence in Hospitality; to Martha? and so of many
other virtues in which the scriptures do particularly exhort Iac. 5, 11.
Judith. 4, 13
us to their imitation. Or may I not He. 13, 7 See Amb. l. de offic. Basil. ep.
ad Greg. Naz.
beholding the end of their conversation, and that which did most shine in
them, demand of God that speaciall virtue in which they did excel? Now
therefore thus do I join with our adversaries. I must imitate in one Saint
one virtue more than another: Therefore I may desire of God in memory and
imitation of the Saint that virtue rather than another: Again whatsoever I
may ask of God: I may also ask of a Saint, according to the true meaning of
prayer to Saints; not as to the principal geuers, but as to our intercessours
for every good gift: even as it is in the^ who living here pray for us: But I
ask of God the imitation of a Saint in a particular virtue more than in
another: therefore I may ask of the Saint himself that particular virtue: and
of another, another.

Hence for diverse states of men, may there be chosen diverse Patrons: Patrons
of diverse states of life.
because of the laudable conversation of some Saints in every degree. Saint
Joseph was a Carpentar, S. George a Soldier S. Anthony an Heremite, S. Edward
a King, S. Cosmas and Damian, Physicians, S. Anne a pattern for married foulkes,
our Blessed Lady for Virgins. Although in this most excellent Queen of
Angels, there having been Eccles. 24, 25.
all grace of life and verity, and her life having been Amb. l. 2. de Virg.
a discipline and instruction for all sorts of men: God has showed more
aboundantlye his greatness Pro. 31, 29
than in any other creature. For according to that most true prediction of her
self: Luc. 1, 48.
All generations shall call me blessed* she has particularly in the Church of
God, in consideration of all manner of benefitts received from her: obtained
those names. Our Lady of pity, our Lady of grace, our Lady of comfort, our
Lady of peace, etc. Our Lady of pity, of grace, and such like.
how truly and religiously each Catholic heart feels: but the senseless
stony minds of heretics cannot but scoff at the same to their utter confusion
at the last. But we shall have the^ one day as well taunte the like names of
God: who although he be but one most simple essence, yet is called diversely.
The God of Comfort, of Mercy, of Hope, of Strength and such like. And not
only particular states of men, but also particular countries may have their
special Patrons. Patrons of Countries.
God having promised Mat. 22, 30.
that the Saints shall be like Angels: and therefore no Dan. 10, 13.21.
Hieron. in 34. Ezech.
doubt have protection of the world. Yea God gimselfe expressly having promised
them that they shall have power over nations Apoc. 2, 27. and 5, 10.
and that they shall rule them. But the cause of the attributing certain
countries to the government of one Saint more than another, most ordinarily is
the desire of imitation of that speaciall Saint either because of his
profession in his life, which the country does speacially embrace, as of a
Soldier or Merchaunte: or because the Leo. ser. 1 de SS. Pet. et Paul. calls
those two Apostles the special Patrons of ROME.
Saint having lived there, has there espeaciallye left lively examples of
his notable virtues.

A second reason of this matter may Ep. 137. ad Cler. and pop. Hipp.
out of Saint Augustine, works some Miracles in one place and not in
another: and consequently by one Saint and not by another. Wherefore if it
please his divine Majesty to show some wonder by any Saint: then does the
devout people take occasion not without the inducement of God himself: in
like miseries to have recourse to the same Saint for convenient remedy. Of
this we have in the Scripture it self some figure and example. DAVID might
have offered in diverse places Sacrifice for the appeasing of Gods wrath: but
1. Par. 21, 27.
only in the Court of Ornan he deserved to see the Angel put up his sword.
Jobs friends by Jobs Job. 42, 9.
Sacrifice only found mercy. If we seek reason hereof: it was only Gods
pleasure. What shall we say of diverse Leuit. 4.
Sacrifices ordained by God for diverse sins? And yet one Sacrifice might
have sufficed, if so it had pleased the Author thereof. Some devils are cast
out by the Disciples: others by Christ Mat. 17, 16.
alone. Yea we read of S. Anthony In Vita.
that when he could not cast out a Devil, he sent the possessed party to his
Disciple Saint Paul called the simple: by whom he was delivered. The cause of
which thing if we should impute to the greater holiness in the one, than in
the other: we should presumptuosly behave our selves toward both. The only
cause therefore is to be referred to the will of God, who being the Lord of
all rivers: yet shows himself more mighty in Jordan, than in 4. Reg. 5, 12.
Abana and Pharphar, rivers of Damascus. We have also a custom in the
Exorcismes of the Church, to charge the Devil to disclose by whom he may be
cast out: for no other cause doubtless, than because God according to his divine
Council and purpose gives a limited strength unto those infernal spirits,
which may so far prevail as he permits, and no farther. Of this we have
a proof in S. Hilarions life. Who being secretly gone into Sicily, was
disclosed by a possessed person in Rome whom the Saint delivered. But there is
a manifest example recorded by an Autenticall Paulus Diac. lib. 6. de gestis
longob c. 2.
writer. Of a great pestilence a thowsande years since in Constantinople and
other places. Of which one being warned be revelation, that it should not
cease until that in the Church of Saint Peter in Vinculis, at Rome, an AVLTAR
were erected to S. Sebastian: his Relickes being brought thither, and an AVLTAR
dedicated, the pestilence ceased. Which AVLTAR is as yet there remaining, and
with great devotion frequented, espeacially in time of pestilence. Theodoret In
Philotheo c. 26.
also witnesses of the general devotion of the Artificers of Rome, to S.
Simeon. Whose Image, he being yet alive, they used to set at the doors of
their shoppes, because of a general opinion that the Saint would protect
their shoppes and wares from robbing. Of which we may read a strange miracle
in that Saints life. The like custom may we read in S. Damascen. Who also
reports the severe judgment of God showed upon three persons one after
another miserably slain, Lib. 3. de Imag.
for attempting to violate the Saints Image, reverently erected at a devout
Christians shop.

A third reason may be alleged those things in which they sin are
ordinarily punished: so Almighty God does speacially bless the torments of
his Saints, and makes their pains occasion of their glory. What did not
(says Sermon. de S. Laurent.
Saint Leo to the tormentour of Saint Laurence) thy wit devise for the glory
of the conqueror: when the very instruments of his torments, were changed
into the honor of his triumph? And of Saint Paul's Chains what S.
Chrysostom says, Hom. 3. in epist. ad Romans and ser. 5. de Job.
all the world knows. How meet is it then that in things proportionable
to the MARTYRS torments, or glorious confession of CHRIST, although he were
not a Martyr, we should run to crave his aid and souccour? And so truly it
is found in Tho. Fazel. decad. 1. lib. 1. cap. 1.
S. Paul. Whereas the stones of the place where the Viper invaded his hands,
cure all the venomous bitings of Scorpions. And in our own Country, the Moss
of S. WENEFRIDS-Well a devout memory of her glorious Martyrdom (besides the
strange sweetness which always is in it) is found a singular remedy
against fire. The like of Saint Agathaes Veil in Sicily, which is known to
preserve the City of Catana from the furious flames of Aetna. How just is it
that the memories of so glorious Virgins, should have special virtue against
fire: whereas they ouercomming their weak sex did burn with the fire of the
Holy Ghost which many waters could not quench: the fire of carnal
concupiscence being utterly extinct in their sacred breasts. As therefore in
the relickes and instruments of the passions of Saints we see certain
particular and determinate things brought to pass: so also may we deuoutely
expecte the same particular effects when upon the sure grounds of the
practice of the Church and some similitude of that which they have suffered for
Christ we invoke them to our particular assistance in some speaciall causes.
And as in the most holy Trinity by the essential attributes of power,
wisdom, and goodness, appropriated more to one person than to another, See
page 313.
we do not deny as much to be in one as in another: so by special devotions
to Saints for particular matters: we do not attribute less to the one then
to the other, but rather stir up our own frailty and weakness to the more
speaciall remembrance of Gods graces in the^. The like is in the Angels Dan.
10, 13.21.
who are allotted unto their several Countries to protect: and Apoc. 8. and 9.
in punishments are ministers of several woes. Hence is that custom sprung,
that devout people pray to S. Apollonia for the tooth-ake because her teeth
were in her Martyrdom stroke out of her head: and therefore she is a fit
Patroness either to obtain delivery, or if it please God that we be not
delivered, a patient sufferance, according to her example. The like may we say
of praying to S. Agatha for sore breasts: because her breast was cut off. To
S. Roche against the plague, and to diverse Saints for diverse things wherein
their virtuous disposition did most show it self.

And to conclude all this with an invincible argument: let our Heretics yield
me a reason, wherefore to the Princes Pollyd. l. 8. histor.
of our country as an hereditary power from S. Edward has bin granted this
gift of curing one particular disease more than another. which if they cannot:
then let them not so curiously and blasphemously deal in the like manner with
Saints. If I have spoken (says our Savior) Io. 3, 12.
unto you earthly things, and you believe not: how if I shall speak to you
heavenly things, will you believe!

Thus much therefore be spoken in defense of the general practices of
Christian Countreies allowed by Pastors and confirmed by long continuance. not
to defend every particular practice of old and simple women. whom
not-withstanding we may for the most part excuse with that saying of S.
Hierome Lib. con. Vigil. See before page. 605.
where in the use of Candells otherwise tha^ by the general custom of the
Church he thought to be received: he favorably interprets such fervent
zeal, not excluding them from their reward according to their faith, but
permitting them to abound in their own sense.

Wherefore if ever it were generally received in our Country, Of praying for
Cattle.
or in any other Catholicke-Countreie, that for the necessities of Beasts and
Cattle devout people did pray to speacial Saints: then will I defend it
against al Heretics of the world. For certain I am, that it is a good and
godly thing to pray for Beasts to God, and consequently to Saints; who may by
their intercession obtain of God that which we ask even for such dumme
creatures. For Christ our Savior teaches us to ask of God our daily-Bread,
wherein is understood by the Fathers, all things necessary to man's uses. And
Solomon Pro. 30, 8.
prays for those things which are necessary for the sustenance of his body,
and amongst the temporal Benedictions of God, David reckons that their Psalm.
143, 13.
Sheep be with Lamb, and their Oxen fat. And God blessed the latter things
of Job, Job. 42, 12.
more than his beginning, even by giving him multitudes of Sheep, Camels,
Oxen, and Asses. And God purposing to bless Jacob with such worldly
substance, Genesis 31, 12.
taught him in his sleep how to increase his reward of Sheep. Well did the
Devil understand thus much, when he said to Almighty God. Job. 1, 10.
Have not thou defended Job and his house, and all his substance about him: and
blessed the works of his hands, and his possessions has increased upon the
earth? Wherefore God permitted the Devil to deprive him also of those outward
things which he possessed. As he did also suffer those Devils to enter into
the Mat. 8, 31.
Swine, and to carry them headlong into the Sea. S. Hilarion taught (as says
S. Hierome in his life) that the devils does enter also into Beasts for men's
sakes, and that he is incensed with so great hatred toward men, that he
desires the destruction not only of the^, but of al their things. Of which
thing he brought an example, that before he was permitted to tempte Job, he
destroyed all his substance. Neither ought this to move any man, that by Gods
commandment two thousand Hogs were killed. For why, those which saw it,
could not otherwise believe so great a multitude of Devils to have gone forth
of one man, unless a great multitude of Hogs, and as it were carried of very
many had perished. And may we not then pray that God will restrain the Devils
power, and increase his care of us, even in these things? We know that God
has not 1. Cor. 9, 9.
care of Oxen: neither has he of 4. Reg. 6, 5.
Hatchets, or 4. Reg. 4, 40.
Pottage, or 4. Reg. 2, 21.
Water, or such other things, for any necessity of his: yet for the use of man
did he show miracles, in making the Hatchet to swim, in seasoning the
Prophets Pottage, and sweetning the Waters. So does God spare Niniue, not only
for infinite Innocents which were within it; but also, as himself says:
Ionae. 4, 11.
for the very brute Beasts in which his hands had labored in a certain
manner when he created them. Neither must we think that man having received al
these things Ps. 8, 8.
of his liberal hands, must not as well look that his mighty power must
conserve also and maintain them.

Wherefore the holy Church, a most intelligent and grateful Spouse of Christ in
the very Sacrifice of the MASS, as for Rain and Faire-weather, so for health
of Cattle prays thus. Orat. pro peste animalium.
O God which even by brute Beasts have provided comfortes for the labors of
men: we humbly beseech thee, that without what things man's estate cannot be
nourished, those thou will make not to perish from our uses: through our Lord
Jesus CHIRIST. Most certain it is therefore that even for these we may pray to
God and his Saints. And if we pray to all the Saints: we may also pray unto
any one. Yet not so that we pray to any one as only able to help us (for that
were superstition) but as to one who amongst the rest can help us, and (if so
it please God to direct the general practice of the Chruch) as to one by whom
it pleases God to help us in this case rather than by another. Sure I am that
at Rome upon S. Anthonies-day there is not one Catholic person, who sends
not his horses to pass before that Saints Church, there to receive the
Benediction of the Priest by the sprinkeling of Holy Water. If a scoffing
Heretic, blasphemous against God and his Saints ask here a reason: I will
say that the practice of the Church guided and directed by the Holy Ghost, is
more to me than my own reason. And that all customs of the Church which are
not contrary to Faith, may by Saint Hieroms Ep. 28. ad Lucin.
warrant be safely observed. And that according to Origin, Hom. 5. in Number.
In Ecclesiastical observations many such things are found, which must be
done of all men, and yet the reason of them is not known to all. And he
brings examples of kneeling in prayer: of praying toward the East: of the
Ceremonies of MASS and Baptism: which are no more necessary to be understood
of al men: than were the Ceremonies of the Jews to them which notwithstanding
devoutly practiced them. And yet could I for my own comfort devise many
congruities in this matter of S. Antony: and amongst the rest, this thing
which S. Hierme In vita Pauli.
writes of him: that a Satyr meeting him, desired his Prayers for the whole
flock of them in the desert. And two Lions which had dug a grave for S.
Paul the Eremits body: Forthwith as it were requiring a reward for their
work, holding down their heads and moving their ears, went to Antony, and
licked his Hands and Feet. But he perceived that they did desire his
Benediction. And without delay, beginning highly to praise Christ, for that the
very brute Beasts had a feeling of God, he said: O Lord without whose will,
not so much as a leaf off the tree does fall, neither one Sparrowe does light
on the ground: grant unto them, even as thou know. And making them sign
with his hand he commanded them to depart. Go now, proud and blasphemous
Heresy; laugh, taunte and scoff, at the devotion of this Saint, and glorious
Doctor of the Church, who writes this, at the devout Piety of Antony, who
did this: and finally of all other Saints of God: but thou my dear Catholic
brother, for whom principally this is written, know and assure thy self,
that 1. Tim. 4, 8.
Piety is profitable to all things, having promise of the life that now is,
and of that to come.

OF INDVLGENCES, OR PARDONS.
1 What is the ground and foundation of Pardons?

FIrst we must here call to mind that which has bin showed above out of
Scriptures and Fathers: See page 209
that sins committed after Baptism although in respect of the fault, and
disgrace of God, and guilt of everlasting pain and damnation; they be fully
remitted through the merits only of Christ's Passion in the Sacrament of
Penance: do notwithstanding leave most ordinarily behind them (if the
contrition be not the greater a debt of Temporal punishment. And that by such
Temporal punishment, satisfaction is to be made unto Gods Justice, either in
this world by works of Penance enioined in the Sacrament, or voluntarily
undertaken: or in the other life in the fire of Purgatory. See page 218


Now therefore as Almighty God has left in his Church authority and
jurisdiction to bind such Penitentes as have recourse to the Sacrament for
help, unto a convenient satisfaction, aunswerable to his divine Justice and
decree: so likewise he being always more prone to Mercy than to Justice, and
his grace superabounding where sin abounds: Romans 5, 10.
It necessarily follows that he has given as great a power to his Pastors,
in the one, as in the other: and therefore as they may impose, so they may
release Penance: as they are executioners of his Justice to punish, so they
are also dispensours of his mercy to remitte and pardon: Finally, as the power
of his Mat. 16, 19.
Keys do extend to bind: so they do also extend to loose whatsoever is bound
or loosed in heaven: which shallbe more largely showed hereafter.

2 What is an Indulgence or Pardon?

Than may we hereby plainly see what is an Indulgence or Pardon: which being
well understood, and duly considered; we shall not need any long discourse for
the proof and defense of the same. An Indulgence therefore or Pardon: is the
remission of the Temporal punishemente due unto sin already forgeuen:
granted by the Pastors of the Church, for just and convenient cause, unto him
which is in Gods grace and favor. Hence it follows that whosoever will be
partaker of an Indulgence granted first he must be in grace: and then perform
that which is in the grant of the Indulgence required: as Fasting, or Prayer,
or Alms: And so he shall enjoy the fruit thereof.

3 How many things are necessary to obtain a Pardon?

But if we will consider all the wholle chain of things concurring and
necessarily required in this matter; we may the better conceive the malitiouse
slanders and cauills of our adversaries herein.

must be heartily sorry for his sins. Secondly, he that he which will obtain
an Indulgence, must besides all this, of necessity either have accepted of his
Ghostly-father, or purposed to take upon himself so great penance, as were in
it self sufficient to satisfy for that pain, which in the Indulgence is
remitted* or at the least that he must have a general purpose to satisfy Gods
Justice in this life, by Godly works and devout labors and sufferings:
otherwise, except the work exacted in the Indulgence be equivalent to the
pain remitted: he shall not enjoy the benefitte. Their reason is, for that he
which has not this mind, as much as in himself lies, to procure his own
succors for his negligence, coldenesse, and slackenesse, deserves not help
of others: and it seems (as they say) that Christ and his Saints intended
not to yield such unnecessary help, whereby negligence might be increased. But
this opinion is by others worthily rejected. Who say, that if the Penitent have
this full conditional resolution, to fulfill his enioined Penance in
Confession, if he cannot obtain by Indulgence the remission thereof: whether
his Penance were great or little* then shall he not being a lively member of
CHRIST be deprived of the participation of the common treasure of his wholle
body, A Purpose of satisfaction very profitable for him which will receive an
Indulgence.
and consequently of such Indulgence. Yet certai^ it i^ that such actual
purpose of satisfying Gods Justice by own penal works, does make a man more
apt ^o receive the wholl Indulgence, and increases the value of the cause,
and Gods acceptance of the recompense which is made unto him by such an
Indulgence: as we will show here^fter.

4 A comparison between the Catholics Pardons and the Protestants Pardons.

THis therefore being the course of all Catholics in obtaining Pardon of
sins: let us on the contrary side, examine a little how many of these things
are to be found in the Protestants Pardons. For that they have Pardons; yea and
plenary Indulgences also, none can doubt, who hears every day that they are
cleansed and purged from all sin, and sure to go to Heaven, so soon as they
shall die. For in very deed, this is not only a full remission of all pains
and punishments, but also a most certain assurance of that singular gift of
God, which is perseverance to the end. Which if the Catholic could persuade
himself so easelye to be gotten: he would with S. Paul 1. Cor. 15, 19.
account himself the most wretched of all men; whereas he should so toil and
labor in infidelity, for that which he ought to assure himself that already
he possesses. But whereas they do so maliciously and contemptuously object
unto us the Popes Pardons, giving the people to understand that the Pope
grants leave to sin beforehand and too easily remitteth that which he
should severely punish and that which is a horrible blasphemy, that he does
make by his Pardons any thing lawful unto us, be it in it self never so
repugnant to Gods holy commandementes: Let us compare our pardons with theirs,
our Iubeleis with theirs, our remissions with theirs.

And to begin first with Confession; it is very well known in their
judgment for the most part to be accounted a thing little agreeable with
nature it self, how many sinful thoughts do they harbor, how many
shameful blasphemous, and injurious words do they utter (always excepting
some few of more civil and natural disposition:) How many brutish acts do
they commit: which they would never fall into, or at the least they would
avoid in part: if besides the judgment of God before which all hidden
things of darkness shall be lightened, 1. Cor. 4, 5.
and all counsels of hearts shall be manifested, they knew they were to make
before a man, and a sinner perhaps as great as themselves, so strait and
particular account? I my self when I lived in my own Country, have had
sufficient experience of diverse: who^ neither love of the world, could
withold: nor custom of sin allure: nor fear of laws keep back: and yet
the only shame of Confession could, and as I think, does as yet detain from
the unity of the Catholic Church: and as our understanding is often blinded
by an infected will, makes the^ not to acknowledge in heart, that which is the
only truth.

Let us then go to another condition; And examine their austere kind of life,
and strict satisfaction to Almighty God. And as for Fasting: what better sign
of a good Protestant then to eat flesh on the Friday, without judging between
day and day? For Alms: if we might have the Voices of all those which are
poor and needy in our Country, in whom this gloriouse virtue does more
shine, whether in Catholics or in Protestants: it would soon appear what
incomparable difference there is. But for Prayer: I appeal to all great house
keepers, or those which are the general harbourers of all sorts of men: yea
and unto all other persons who converse indifferentlye abroad: whether if a
man be not otherwise known to be a Protestant, it be not a manfest probability
of a Papist, to say his prayers devoutly upon his knees at his bedd-sid, either
morning or evening. Sure I am that there be many honest matrons and diverse
simple persons amongst the Protestants, who after the example of CORNELIUS Act.
10, 2.
endeavor according to their knowledge, to serve Almighty God, and to attend
to works of Charity and Prayer: whom I hope GOD does now dispose by little
and little with his preuenting-grace, to receive one day a perfect knowledge
of his will, when they may by his cooperating-grace, with such good works
build unto everlasting salvation, which in their present estate Heb. 11, 6.
Romans 14, 23
they cannot. But even these do I call to witness, earnestly entreating them
for the honor of God, and without all vainglory (as they have little cause
thereof) to show how many examples they have seen of the like devotions.

Then let us examine whether at the least there be to be found some great cause
of Pardon and Indulgence, which we propounded in the sixth place, as necessary
in our remissions. And perhaps we shall find some building of Hospitals: some
erecting of Churches: some enterprise against the Turks, the enemies of
Christ, and of Christendom: some solemn and general prayer for the
necessities of the Church: which are the causes ordinarily pretended in our
Indulgences. But on our adversaries side how the matter does stand, the
miserable ruins of antiquities do show: their ravenous gaping after
Ecclesiastical goods do testify: their intolerable vexations of their poor
neighbors do cry Exodus 22, 23.
up to Heaven. But these be outward things, Confession, Penance, Works of
Devotion. It may be that the intenall things, as Sorrow, purpose of Amendment,
a severe examination of their Actions, Words, and Thoughts, do so much excel;
that there can be no need of those outward Ceremonies. Espeacially whereas
now the time is come when we must serve God in spirit and truth. And yet
there is nothing less. For how can they settle themselves to the particular
search of their sins, who neither purpose to Confess them particularly to
the Priest, God knowing them already more particularly than themselves: and
besides (if they stand to their Masters doctrine) maintain that al our works
are sins, if God straightly examine them? So that if this be credited, they need
not seek to sort ye good deeds from the badde. But for purpose of keeping Gods
Commandments: they should highly deceive themselves, if ever they should
make it. For they hold it an impossible thing, to observe the same. And as for
sorrow, that they think not necessary. For that METANOIA, which they cannot
deny, because it is so often commended unto us in the Scriptures: they will not
have to signify a sorrowefull repentance, Beza upon Mat. 3. and Luther. ser.
de poenit.
but a RESIPISCENCE, or waxing wise again (which God grant they may do)
without any sorrow, or affliction of mind for that which is past. And
although some of their Doctors do require such sorrow: yet, neither will
they have it the cause of remission of sins, nor necessary for such effect.
But only they require Faith as a necessary, and sufficient cause, after which
as they most absurdly say, by a necessary sequel follows this sorrow, even
whether we will or no. And yet here must I needs crave pardon, if I say yt
they are also void of Faith. For there can be but one Ephesians. 4, 5. Heretics
have no Faith.
Faith, and he which denies one point of Faith, although he give credit to
the rest; that is not a Divine Faith, but a humane persuasion; whereas if it
were that Supernatural Faith, and Theological Virtue, which is Conc. Araus. 2.
c. 5.
necessary for to believe a right: it would incline a man to believe all
things which God has spoken, as well as one. Wherefor it is an infallible
verity, Council. Trid. sess. 6. cap. 15. See page 479.
that eue^ as grace is lost by every mortal sin: so by infidelity in one
only point, the wholle substance of Faith does perish. Now where there is
not Divine Faith, how can there be a divine hope? Hope being grounded in
Faith, as S. PAVL Heb. 11, 4.
says, which, although they brag never so much of their Justification by
Faith, so long as in any one thing they dissent from the Church, they cannot
have. Wherefore although I might say that they require nothing at all for their
justification, because they cannot (being as they are) have so much as Faith,
the beginning and foundation of all disposition thereunto: yet supposing that
they were in the right Faith: consider good Reader, who forgiueth sins more
easily: The POPE, or Calvin? The POPE requiring those six things which I
spoke of before: and the Protestants allowing scant one of them.

5 How wickedly our pardons are slau^dred.

FOr whereas they do so wickedly slander the Pastors of ye Church, as if
they did grant Pardons to license men to sin, and to dispense thereby in Gods
commandments: it is a thing which never any CATHOLIC did yield, nor ever
any POPE did challenge to himself, but always acknowledged that every simple
Priest might to those which are his subjects, remit the mortal sins
themselves, although not the temporal punishements thereof, in as high and
ample manner as he himself, he having no authority to remitte out of
Sacraments any one mortal sin in the world. Much-lesse to permit it as
lawefull. Whereas God himself in such things cannot, according to the Doctrine
of Divines dispense, who being a Sovereign goodness, cannot be the author of
sin: and as the Apostle says 2. Tim. 2, 12. Heb. 6, 18.
cannot deny himself. Let them turn over al our Books, our Schoolmen, our
Canonistes, and Summistes, and if they find in any one Author of credit that
all the things above mentioned must not of necessity concur: and so has
always been understood in the practice of the Church after the manner by us
declared: they shall recover their creditte, of true and honest dealing. Let
them look upon our Extrauagants or Bulls, where Iubeleis or other Pardons are
granted and published, and if they do not there find that Particle or clause
expressed, that they which will obtain such Indulgence must be Vere
Poenitentes.
truly penitent, then let them freely without shame blaspheme the jurisdiction
of the Church. Yea they shall for the most part find, that actual
Confession is a thing expressly required, Actual Confession not always
necessary.
as one parcel of such things as are causes of the Indulgence: and then is it
impossible to obtain such indulgence without Confession: although at other
times when Confession is not expressly mentioned, it is not necessary but only
to those whose conscience is burdened with mortal sin, who cannot in the new
law obtain justification, but by Confession either actual, or in vow and
desire. For of such as are not in grace must that be understood which we have
said before, when we spoke of six things necessary in an Indulgence.
otherwise if one be already in grace: he has virtually those five first
things: and needs nothing but to do that which is the cause of the
Indulgence, whether it be Confession or Receiving, or Alms, or Fasting or any
other such devout action.

As for the Simony which they charge us withal in these Pardons: No Simony in
Pardons.
we neither buy nor sell Pardons: but sometimes the work required for which
they are granted is Alms, and yet few or none are now graunded for any Alms
to the POPES cofers: but only to be given at the parties discretion, thereby
to take away all cause of scandal.

6 Why Pardons are called remissions of sins, whereas they take away the
punishment only.

But it may peradventure somewhat move our adversaries, that we call these
Indulgences, remissions of sins, whereupon it seemteh we understand the very
faults themselves, not the punishments thereof. But this we can easily declare
unto the^ by an example of a Father, who although he have received into favor
his son whom he had disinherited, which is to remitte him his fault, and to
receive him into his grace: yet does he impose oftentimes some lighter
punishment for the same fault, both as a cautell for that which is to come,
and as a just revenge for the offense remitted, and then he may justly be said
not to have perfectly forgiven his sons fault. So also does the holy
Scriptures call the guilte of punishment by the name of sin. Genesis 43, 8.
Unless I shall (says IVDAS to JACOB) bring again the child: I will be
guilty of a sin unto thee all my life. And God is said to render the sin of
the fathers upon the children. Deuteronomy. 5, 9. 3. Reg. 1, 21. Pro. 16, 6.
I and my son SOLOMON shall be sinners. And by mercy and verity, iniquity is
redeemed. And although sometimes in Pardons it be said A CVLPA and POENA: What
these words A Culpa and Poena signify.
From the fault and the punishment: the true meaning of the Church therein is:
that the fault must be remitted, either before the seeking of the Indulgence:
or else in the very work which is the cause of the Indulgence: when Confession
is exacted for obtaining the same. Or ye otherwise by Contritio^ the work is
performed in grace: so that there is given both together: Whether all the
works for the Indulgence must be done in grace.
yet by diverse causes. The first, by Confession, or Contrition: the second, by
the Indulgence. For although it be not necessary, that for to obtain an
Indulgence all the works which are done for the same, be done in Gods grace: yet
is it very necessary that all those works be thoroughly done, and that the
last work of all in which the Pardon is to be received, be not only done with
a certain moral perferction, but also in the grace and favor of God. For
example: There is a Iubiley, in which it is granted that whosoever Fasteth
three days, and gives Alms, and such a day visits such a Church praying
for some particular necessities, shall have a plenary Indulgence. Although a
man do the other in state of mortal sin, yet if he for the same good
purposes do thoroughly perform them, and then having by the ordinary means
obtained Gods grace, visitte the Church: he shall receive the Indulgence: and
yet if the POPE should so grant it, that he must first Confess, and then
Fast, and give Alms, and visitte the Church: then would I think that his
intention were, to have all the things following performed in grace: and so if
he fall in the midst of ye week so yt he fast not in grace: he gets nothing.

7 Of diverse kinds of Indulgences.

FOr the better declaration of the custom of the Church in this matter of
Indulgences: it is to be understood, that we may divide Pardons two manner of
ways. First, in respect of the quality of the punishment released:
Secondly, in respect of the quantity of the same punishment taken away.

The punishment it self sometimes is enioined in Penance by the
Ghostly-Father: sometimes it is due either by the Canons of the Church,
allotting certain Penances for every fault; or in the stricte examination of
Gods just judgment, who only searches the heart, and knows the depth of our
deserts. From all these kinds may the Church absolve, for that sovereign
authority which it has recriued, as we have partly showed above, and shall more
exactly be showed hereafter.

Pardon of Penance enioined, and of other pains also.
And herein is founded the first division of Indulgence, into remission of
Penance enioined: and of penance which is in the sight of God due. Where we
must also note, that unless it be specified in the Bull, or grant of the
Indulgence, that it is only of Penance enioined: it is to be understood of al
manner of Penance. Pardons only of Penance enioined, is never understood, but
when it is so specified.
And when it is so specified: then does the Indulgence nothing profitte him wc
has no Penance enioined. Wherefore for the obtaining of such Pardons: it is
very good in this respect to demand of the Confessor so much extraordinary
Penance as may be taken away by the same: intending to fulfill the Penance in
deed, if the release thereof be not obtained. And the greater the Penance is,
either in continuance, or in sharpness: the more punishment is released by the
Pardon thereof. As if the Pardon be of seven years of enioined Penance: even
as more satisfaction is made by fasting thrice a week for that time, than by
once a week: so the Pardon of the first, is more available than of the
second. It is good always to perform Penance enioined, notwistanding an
Indulgence.
In like manner is it of the Pardon of a Penance of seven years, in respect
of the like Penance for five.

Yet this must we advertise every devout Catholic: that he be not for
respect of Indulgences, slack in performing his ordinary enioined penance: for
that ordinary Penance wc is enioined is not only in satisfaction of that which
is past: but also for a remedy for future harms. And being enioined as an
opposite thing unto those in which he sinned, teaches him how to overcome
himself, in his evil inclinations, and to lay foundations of great and
singular merits and virtues.

Secondly, Pardons are divided in respect of the quantity of the Punishments
deserved. For some are full remissions, others are not full remissions.

The full remissions are by some great Divines very probablely said to be of
three sorts. Full Pardons of diverse sorts by some Divines.
For they say that there is a Plenary, a more Large, and a most full
Indulgence. The first they will have to be a remission of the punishmente of
those sins only which are confessed: The second, of the punishment due to
those which are Confessed; and besides to all mortal sins by forgetfulness
not Confessed: The third, they will have to contain above these, the remission
of the punishment even of venial sins: so that then there is nothing
remaining to be paid.

Yet other great Divines also do under the name of a Plenary comprehend all
these: A Plenary but of one sort.
affirming that a Plenary Indulgence takes away all temporal punishment for
all sins remitted. And considering that this matter does depend of the
intention of the dispensour of the treasures of the Church: it seems that
this second opinion in our age, stands with truth: for that it seems that
such is now the general meaning of that word Plenary.

Yet howsoever it be: certain it is, Iubiley, the most large of all.
that those Indulgences which are called Iubileys, are the most Large. Both
because although the aforesaid distinction were true; yet the Iubiley is in
the highest degree; and for that, although we must reverently think of all
causes of Indulgences coming from our Superiors: yet there can be no iuster
cause of Pardon, than that which is the motive of the Iubiley: which therefore
is most safe and sure.

A just and proportionable cause always necessary.
For the better conceiving of this point, we will here advertise the Reader,
that in every Indulgence there is required a just and convenient cause. For the
governors of the Church are dispensers only of Gods mysteries, 1. Cor. 4, 2.
and therefore it is a point of their fidelity with just causes and
convenient means to execute their office. Wherefore although it be a general
Axiom of Divines, that Indulgences are of such value, as they sound: yet this
is to be understood, Indulgentiae tantum valent, quantu^ sonant.
if the cause be proportionable. Otherwise although they do somewhat profit,
yet so much only as the proportion of the cause requires. And so may it
happen, that although a cause be pretended as sufficient for a Plenary, or
other Indulgence which is in deed proportionable, A sufficient cause, to some
not sufficient.
if it be executed with great devotion and fervor: yet may it be so coldely
done of some particular persons, that it arriueth not to the full obtaining of
the Pardon, but only in some degree known to God alone.

Hereof may it appear why I said the Iubiley to be the safest. What is a
Iubiley.
For the Iubiley was first instituted in imitation of the Iubiley of the old
Law when a full release of many rigorous difficulties of that law was made
according to MOISES his prescript. And this our observation of certain times
wherein the people of God should more earnestly attend unto aspirituall
liberty, Leuit. 25.
and a speaciall uniting of the whole Church together in that lincke of charity
which Christ left unto his members, and most of all unto a continual
communication and concord with the successors of Saint PETER: how necessary
and profitable it has been: the experience of many years does evidently show.
This Iubiley had wont to be observed every hundredth yeaer, Year of Iubiley.
afterward for the shortness of man's life was reduced to every fiftith: and now
is observed after every five and twenty.

But besides this general Iubiley, Particular Iubileis.
sometimes there are particular Iubileys sent forth for some singular great
necessity of the Church: in which for that the necessity is urgent, and great
and solemn causes are enioined for the obteyning thereof, and the wholle
Church of Christ over all the world with one heart and one mind concurreth:
no doubt can be made at all, but the cause is sufficient, and Christ's
liberality is open unto the world: by which that cause which of it self is
great and sufficient, through the merits and prayers of his spouse, is also
made abundant to every one which with mean zeal and fervor fulfilleth the
same.

Now to return to our division of Indulgences. Indugences not Plenaries.
Those Indulgences which are not full remissions: are of diverse sorts. some
are indeterminate: others, certain and determinate. Of the first kind are
those, which remitte some proportionable part of sins: as the third part,
or such other like. In the second are those comprehended, The third part of
sins. Quarantenes.
which do speacifie a certain number of days; as 7. 10. a quarentene, that
is of 40. days: or of years; as of one, of 10 of 100. 1000. or as it shall
please the giver, according to the ancient custom of enioined Penances: Conc.
Ancyr. c. 8. Nicen. 1. c. 11. and 12. Elib. cap. 5. The meaning of so many
years in Pardons.
not that any man shall live so long, or as some Heretics will grossly after
their accustomed manner scoff and taunt, that a man having had such an
Indulgence may be sure that he may have no time limited to his iniquity: nor
that the Church will presume to define that Purgatory shall remain so long: it
being to expire at the day of Judgment: But that it may so be, that any
persons sins though remitted: have left behind them so much guilte of
temporal satisfaction or punishment. For if the severe estimation of the
Primitive Church has adjudged every notable mortal sin to 7. years
Penance: then how many years Penance should so many thoughts, so many words,
so many actions deserve as are in this cold age of ours so little regarded? It
is wisdom to seek many Pardons.
Wiselye therefore do they who never cease to procure these Christian helps
of our frailty, not contemning them as small, because they are not Plenaries:
For it may so happen that to one which owes 4: years only of satisfaction:
7. years may be as good as a Plenary. Moreover of Plenary Indulgences none
can be sure; no, nor of any Indulgence at all: whereas they cannot be sure of
their estate of grace in the seeking of them, and if they be in grace: yet of
any certain determination of their deserts of temporal pain: they cannot
have knowledge: neither of the full obtaining of so many years as are
granted of Pardon. The only way is therefore continually to embrace these
motherly favors of holy Church, and that so much the more: for that in the
race of our mortality, continually our burden increases: and whilst we seek
to cast off the old: uncertain of our discharge^, we do most certainly (at
the least with Venial sins) dog our selves with new.

The true meaning therefore of these years or days is this: The meaning of
years and days.
that look how much of the pains of Purgatory we could redeem with one years
Penance in this world, such as might by reason be inioined us, our devotion and
fervor and desire of satisfying Gods Justice See page 640.
considered: so much now by the benignity and mercy of the Church is in one
years Indulgence released: and so of other quantity of years and days. Which
unto him who considers that by one year of Voluntary satisfaction in this
life, much more then a year of necessary sufferance in Purgatory may be
recompensed: will seem no small benefitte. And it must not move us that we
cannot remain so many thousand years in Purgatory for neither Purgatory is
measured by our time and years and days: and God can by increase of the pain
even in the day next before the general Judgment, supply the wholle due of
many thousand years. After which manner they which are found alive at the day
of Judgment shall not want their Purgatory.

8 The right and authority of Gods Church in giving Pardons, is largely proved.

A Learned and famous Author, very well known unto our adversaries; not
unworthily, charge them with a common fault which he calls SCIOMACHIA,
fightinge with a shadow. This fault if in any other matter they commit; in
this of Indulgences, they surely are intolerable. I have sufficiently touched
their slanders above. And whenever they write or speak of this point, they
do nothing else, but either not understanding, or maliciously slaundering the
true intent of the Church, make themselves adversaries where they have none;
impugn certain absurdities which we more than they detest; reprehende abuses
which we root Con. Trid sess. 5. de reformat. cap. 2. and sess. 21. de reform.
cap. 9.
out; finally like mad, or dronken persons, fight with a shadow, and that
also of their own making. Wherefore least this poor labor of mine, taken
principally, and only for my dear Catholic Brethren, or those who being out
of the way, would be glad to have some direction unto the truth; might by any
missefortune fall into the hands of some SHADOVVE-KILLER: I thought it
expedient before I entered into any deep demonstration of this matter, first
to set them down the simple truth: which being done, even as it were by the
very same Candel which first was shadowed by themselves, now placed between
them and their shadow, the shadow vanishing, the quarrel might without any
blows at all be peacablely finished.

Yet now will I as well for the simple Catholics understanding, as for the
better breaking of such skittishe wits, from finding bugges where there is no
cause: make some farther consideration of the truth; showing and proving it
out of holy Scriptures, and continual practice of Gods Church.

But before we take this matter in hand: we must warn our adversaries, that
here we do not intend to dispute whether there be any Temporal punishment
after the remission of the sins themselves necessarily to be suffered of the
penitent person: For this we suppose as certain, See page 209
and before sufficiently proved. The like also do we advertise them of
authority to remitte sins leafte by Christ in his Church: which here we touch
not, See page 209
as already showed.

Now therefore thus we will briefly conclude our purpose. Mat. 16, 19.
Keys of the kingdom of Heaven, authority to Io. 20, 22
remitte sins, the 2. Cor. 5, 19.
word of reconcilement, dispensours 1 Cor. 4, 1.
of his mysteries, feeders Io. 21, 15.
of his sheep, stewardes Mat. 24, 45.
of his family to give every one meat in due season: But in every one of
these is without any limitation contained every thing belonging to those
several offices of gouernmente, feeding, and remitting: and consequently the
remission of temporal Chastisement and correction: most certainly therefore
has God left the same in his Church But such authority cannot be executed in
the Sacrament of Penance, which as we supposed is only ordained to remit the
offense of God, always in as much as it has in it self, leaving a Temporal
punishment: Therefore it is to be executed out of the Sacrament; which is the
very Indulgence which we defend.

Secondly S. PAVL in the The Heretics falsely translate in the sight of
Christ.
person of Christ, 2 2. Cor. 2, 10.
and at the request of the Corinthians, pardons the incestuous person,
remitting him (as THEODORET expounds, and the words do manifestly importe)
part of his deserved Penance: But what authority Christ gave unto S. PAVL: the
same has he left in his Church, until Ephesians. 4, 13.
we meet al into the unity of Faith, and knowledge of the Son of God, into a
perfect man: that is, even unto the worlds end: The very word of Pardon in
the Scriptures. Pardons are always given in the power of Christ. Io. 8, 11.
Therefore does there now remain in the Pastors the same authority. See
here the very word of Pardoning: if the Heretics have not left it out, or
altered it in their Bible. Where also is to be noted, that S. PAVL executed
this leuity in the Person of Christ: and so do our Pastors, always using
this Phrase: Mercifully in our Lord we release. Of which our Savior has left
us sundry examples in diverse offenders, particularly in the aduoutresse,
whose temporal punishment he released.

3 Can. 11.
Thirdly, the first Council of Nice unto some which had fallen in persecution,
and whom the Council calls unworthy of mercy: yet determines to show
humanity: and imposing them Penance: yet gives liberty to the Bishop, upon
the fruit of their repentance, and demonstration of a sorroweful mind, to
deal yet more gently. But what is this but a Pardon?

Can. 2.
The like authority is given to Bishops in the Anciran Council before the
Nicen Council concerning Deacons, which in persecution for fear did sacrifice
unto Idolles, and toward others also, that they may HVMANIVS AGERE: Can. 5.
Deal more favorably.

Can. 75, 76.77.79.
Diverse Canons we have also in the fourth Council of Carthage, where S.
AUGUSTINE was present, of the speedy, or slow reconciling of Penitentes.
Which is nothing else but to remitte them their temporal punishmente: which
they at that time fulfilled, as now also sometimes is done in the Church
before reconciliation by the Sacrament of Penance.

Fourthly S. CYPRIAN in diverse epistles complains of those which ouer-easely
did give peace unto Penitents: 4 Lib. 1 ep. 3. and lib 3 ep. 14. 18 and ser de
lapsis.
for so he calls that which we now call Pardons, and he writes unto the holy
Confessors of Christ then in Prisons, to request them not to exceed herein.
For those which for some faults were in the number of Penitents: ordinarily
had recourse unto those which for Christ's sake did suffer torments or
imprisonment, and by their letters commended to their Bishops, were for their
sakes released. Of which custom TERTVLLIAN also is a notable witness:
exhorting the Martyrs to peace amongst themselves, in lib. ad Mart. desig.
because they obtained peace for many; which otherwise had not peace in the
Church.

Fifthly the Penitential Canons of the Church were made and decreed by the
Church:

But if one should obiecte: that they did no more, then we are accustomed to
do, who when we enioine Penance less then the deserte, do not withal pardon
the wholle satisfaction: so does it not seem that these Fathers pardoned their
Penitents, but only were contented with a small Penance, leaving the rest to
Gods judgment and their devotion This cannot be any ways defended, for they
wholly pardoned them, and gave them Peace, and never charged them with any care
or study of farther satisfaction: wherefore they much differed from our manner
of Penance: who never enioine it as a sufficient remedy, but as a necessary
part of the sacrament, and a medicine for the time to come: having also regard
in some part to satisfy the Justice of God still leaving the parties
persuaded of their farther debte.

Penances now more easy, and Pardons more common then in times past.
Thus much be spoken of that fervent time of the Primitive Church, when devotion
abounding neither sins were so rise, nor Penances so easy as now a days And
therefore in those days, were the Penances so great and so long, that those
holy and learned Fathers thought them sufficient to make a full satisfaction
unto that which Gods judgment had decreed unto sins remitted. Since which
time the holy Church has tenderly provided for the delicatenes of her
children, least they should be 2. Cor. 2, 11.
circumuented by Satan, and so quite overthrown from their wholle course of
Religion. For which respect, as she is more mild in imposing of Penances, not
remitting but leaving the greatest part of the due correction to men's own
election: so is she also more liberal at convenient times, in imparting of the
Treasure of the Church to their release and pardon. not only remitting enioined
Penances, which would have been sufficient in the new spring of the Church
according to the course of those days: but also in a most large manner
absoluing from al manner of desert of Punishment.

Now therefore having showed most manifestly this practice of the Church both
in the Apostles time, and in the time of the Martyrs, What manner of adversaries
Pardons have had.
and after them when a general peace was given to the whole flock of Christ:
there cannot be any question of the times following, this verity never being
called into doubt before IHON WICLEFFE with his scholar IHON HVSSE and MARTIN
LVTHER three persons of eternal infamy, began to perturbe not only the
peaceable government of the Church, but also therewith, all true Christian
policy of civil common wealths. For one of WICLEFFS artickles is this. Conc.
Co^statien. sess. 8. art. 15.
There is no man either a temporal Lord or Prelate or Bishop, whilst he is
in mortal sin. And another. art. 29.
Universities, Studies, Collegies, Degrees, and mastershippes in the same, are
by vain heathenisme brought in, and as much profit the Church, as the devil.
And again. art. 6.
God must obey the devil. These articles were confirmed also by IHON HVSSE: who
more plainly utters there a good lesson of theirs, wc with the condemnation
in the Council of Constance we will also set down. Sess. 15.
Every Tyran may and ought lawfully and meritoriously to be slain by whatsoever
his vassal or subject, yea by secret deceites and subtle fawnings or
flatterings: notwithstanding any oath taken, or confederacy made with him,
without expectation of any sentence or commission from any Judge whatsoever.
This is the goodly doctrine of them, who as they began at the first to derogate
unto the high jurisdiction of Christ his Church: so they went forward to
abolish, as much as in the did lie, all civil roialty. so that worthily we may
say that they were such as S PETER and S. IVDE did speak of, 2. Pet. 2, 10.
Iudae. Ver. 8
who despise dominion, and blaspheme majesty, being bold, self pleasers, and
such as fear not to bring in sects. But that we may see how reverend account
the Catholic Church has always made of obedience due to temporal Princes 1.
Pet. 2, 18
not only modest but even to those which are waiwarde, in all just and lawful
actions, for otherwise we must obey Act. 5.29. The Catholics most exact
defenders of temporal obedience.
God rather than man. Let us here the Counsels grave sentence of this matter.
Against this error this holy SYNOD endeavoring to oppose it self, and
utterly to take it away: does declare and define that this doctrine is
erroneous in faith and manners: and condemns and reprooueth it as heretical,
scandalous, and opening a way to frauds, deceites, lies, treasons, periuries.
Moreover it declares and decrees, that whosoever do stubbornely affirm this
most perniciouse doctrine, are Heretics, and as such according to the
Canonical decrees are to be punished.

Thus much of the first breeders of this heresy IHON WICLEFFE and IHON HVSSE:
the first of the wc (that you may the better know him) therefore departed from
the Church in the which he had been a Priest: Tho. Wald. l. 2. doct. c. 60.
only because he had the repulse from a Bishopric. As for MARTIN LVTHER; it
is well known what gifts of the holy Ghost he had, who had not the gift to
observe that chastity which he had Vowed, and to keep himself from a
sacrilegiouse and incestuouse life. That we may think that in him as a first
ADAM of this new creation, all the ministerial posterity for the most part
has been infected.

But it will not be amiss and far from our purpose of Indulgences, Luthers
fall quarrel against Indulgence. This office is now taken away by the Counsel
of Trent. Io Coch. in ye acts of Luther an. 1517. In anno. 1519. In epist. ad
Argentin.
to let the Reader understand thus much: that forthwith after his strange
vocation to his new kind of licentiouse life, the first quarrel that he
pretended was against Indulgences: and that not upon zeal and conscience but
only for ambition and envy, that the office of preaching Pardons, and
publishing the POPES Bulls was from the order of S. AUGUSTINE, in which he
had many years lived a Moncke, translated to the order of Dominican Friars.
Whereupon in his first disputation at Lipsia, he gave a clear testimony of the
spirit by which he was called: when he cried out: This matter neither was
begone for God: neither shall be ended for God. And that you may the better
perceive his ghostly zeal: he says, that if the Scriptures had not been most
clear against him in the matter of the Blessed Sacrament: he would for to
have done the POPE a displeasure, long before have denied the Reall-Presence,
which notwithstanding he never durst That we may say nothing of his singular
profiting in his Masters schole, Lib de Missa angular.
when he said that he had been taught of the Devil that MASS was naught,
and therefore that he had abolished it.

Against this man and his predecessors if we should allege the Council of
Trent, The Council of Trent. sess 25.
wherein all the Learning and Holiness of the wholle world conspired together:
Undoubtedly unto him, who in respect of himself contemns a thousand
AUGUSTINES, and as many CYPRIANS, In his book against K. Hary.
and thought King HENRY the 8. one of the most famous Princes of the world,
with all his fellow Princes, not to be worthy to vnlatche his shoe: we may
well think what it would avail. Much a like would it prove if we should
bring him the general Council of Constance: The Council of Constance.
where being so many Schismatickes about the true POPE: wonder it is that
they should agree in this point, as in all other points of Religion, if the
truth had not prevailed.

But what will they say of other general Councelles, before ever Hell had
opened mouth against this most certain verity?

The general Council of Vienna, The Council of Vienna. Clem. de reliqu. and
vener SS. cap. vnico. de poenit. and remis. cap. 2.
did acknowledge the power of giving Indulgences. For in that Council by
CLEMENT the fifth, were granted Pardons in the Feast of CORPUS CHRISTI day.
And order taken against the abuses of some which unlawfully preached
Indulgences.

And in the general Council holden at Lions, The Council of Lions. cap. 1. de
poenit. and remis. in sexto.
under INNOCENTIVS the fourth: we have admonition given to Bishops, not to
exceed in granting Indulgences

And before that, the great Lateran Council The Latera^ Council. anno. 1198.
under INNOCENTIVS the third, limiteth the Cap. 2. de poenit. and remiss. ca.
cum ex eo.
Indulgences of Bishops. The same also takes away Cap. 60. and de exces.
Praelat. cap. Accedentib.
the abuse by which Abbates had woonte to grant Indulgences. We have also in
the same, Cap. 3. and de Haeret. c. excommun.
mention of Indulgences used to be granted to those which went to the recovery
of the Holy Land. As we have at the De paenit. and remis.
same time an answer in a question of Indulgence by HONORIVS the third: as
also of ALEXANDER the third, before all these. Where these Counsels and POPES
speak of them, not as of a new divise, but as of a thing generally used in
the Church.

BONIFACIVS C. Nostro. and C. quod aute^. Pardons were not newely practiced
five hundred years ago.
also the eight in his Extrauagant wherein he proclaims the Iubiley: says
that by faithful relation of ancients, there were many remissions and
Indulgences granted in the Apostles Churches at ROME. Neither was the Iubiley
first instituted by him, but See the gloss of Io. Monach. who lived in his
time.
as an usual thing every hundred year practiced. And Iacobus Cardinalis, in
libro. de centessimo.
a writer of that age, makes mention of an old man who that year came to
ROME, and reported that his Father was at ROME for the same cause the hundred
year before; An. 1300. The beginning of Iubiley is unknown.
and had commanded him if he lived so long, to go thither the next Iubiley So
that we know no certain beginning of the Iubiley. But that it was by this
POPE Anno. 1300.
ordained to be every 100. year. And by CLEMENT Anno. 1350.
the 6. every 50. Afterward by decree of SIXTVS ye 4. Anno. 1475.
brought unto every 25. year. Where it now remains.

To this we add the ancient practice of the stations in ROME, that is, the
visiting of certain particular Churches in the Lent, Aduent, and Imber days;
and other times also, in which stations from very ancient times used: as from
the time of Saint GREGORY at the least; as appears in his Sacramentary:
great Pardons have been granted to those wc visit with devotion the aforesaid
Churches.

Now if five general Counsels, and so many ancient Doctors, without any
contradiction, with such general consent, and ioifull approbation of all
Christendom, grounded upon the express authority of Gods own word and
jurisdiction granted to the Church, and practice of Antiquity, be not
sufficient to convince any understanding: there is nothing sufficient to
perform the same.

9 The same verity is proved by reason necessarily deduced out of Scriptures:
And the treasure of Indulgences is declared.

But we will moreover by necessary consequence deduce this wholle matter out of
holy Scriptures, whereby we shall give a farther light to our wh^ll discourse.
But first I suppose these things following as most true, yet briefly touching
also the grounds thereof.

1 We may being in grace satisfy for Temporal punishment.
First, that a man Justified by Gods grace, and having a Temporal debte of
punishmente remaining, may justly and equally Dan. 4.24 Pro. 16, 6. Luc. 3, 8.
2 Cor 7, 10. See page 209
satisfy unto Gods Justice for the same. The Divines distinguish a double
kind of justice between God and us, as well in Meritte, as in Satisfaction.
The one is a certain rigorous justice, the other a justice of condignitie. The
first requires a rigorous equality in the work; and that, that which is
offered unto God, be of the offerers goods, not received of the liberality of
him to whom it is offered. And such justice was in Christ's Meritte and
satisfaction unto his Father for us: but in us there can be nothing which we
have not liberally received of God: and therefore in this rigorous manner, we
can neither meritte the least grace in the world, nor satisfy for the least
idle word.

The second requires nothing else, but a certain proportion of the work
which is offered, and besides, the favor and acceptance of God, and promise
either of reward, or of release of punishment: which is always found in him
which is in grace. For he which remains in Christ, Io. 15, 5. 1. Io 3, 9.
Io. 3, 21. 1. Cor. 15, 10.
he brings much fruit. For he has the seed of God within him, and his
works are done in God: and the grace of God works with him. Now hence it
proceeds, that although we cannot bring any condign satisfaction for our
sins, or for the pains of Hell due unto them, so long as we be either
withered branches, or altogether out of the vine: we may notwithstanding
undoubtedly being quickened by the same lively vine, and having the holy ghost
within us, perfectly do the same for our temporal debt. Yet by that which is
Gods, and which we have received of God Wherefore we must say with DAVID unto
God: thine are all things, 1. Par. 29, 14
and what we have received of thy hand, we have given unto thee. After this
manner do we hold, that life everlasting which is indeed To. 1, 23.
grace: is also most certainly a Mat. 20, 8. 2. Tim. 4, 8. See page 481
Crown of justice: and the day penny, and a reward. And this in our present
case of satisfaction, is so much the more easy, for that this satisfaction
which is to be made, is but only for temporal punishmente, the everlasting
being by the Sacrament changed into temporal. An^ what marvel is it then
by our works to satisfy ^o this; if we may by our works deserve Heaven? So
that to satisfy for our temporal punishment is nothing else, but as if a
Traitor received into his Princes favor again, should by his go^d deserts,
helped als^ by the same Princes creditte, and grace, be admitted into the
felloweship of his Princely throne: and who may doubt, but that this man may
with more ease obtain the release of a small fine, or amercement, then he has
deserved so great a dignity? One may satisfy for another, if both be in grace.
Now therefore will we account a most clear truth: that he which is in Gods
grace, may satisfy for his temporal debte of Gods correction.

Secondly I make also this supposition, that such a necessary link Ephesians. 4,
4. To. 12, 4. Gal. 6, 2. 1. Cor. 12, 12 Ps 118, 63. Phil. 1, 5. 1 Io. 1, 3. Aug
tra. 32. in Io.
there is amongst all those which are lively members of Christ: that as they
receive life and vigor from the head, so they communicate also help and
comfort one to another: which is the communion of Saints. And that in virtue
of this communication and fellowship, one which is in grace, even as he may of
Justice and with equality, (as we have said) satisfy God for his own sins
remitted. So may he also of the like justice and equality satisfy for
another, being also in grace. This does S PAVL not once declare unto us: when
he says, that 2. Cor. 8, 14.
the abundance in spiritual things of those in Jerusalem, shall supply the
want of the Corinthians. The like has he of the To. 15, 72.
Romans. And he Col. 1, 24.
reioiced in suffering for the Collossians, and accomplishing in his flesh
those things which want of the Passions of Christ, for his body, which is the
Church: such being the disposition of Christ's heavenly wisdom: that
although ^h^re be no insufficiency in his own Passions, yet he will glorify
his wholle body, uniting his Passions with the Passions of his mystical
members to his own honor, and the succor and relief of his wholle Church.
And this second supposition must also be understood of those which are Dead
and in Purgatory, For with them yet remaineh the same Communion. And those
which are alive 1. Cor. 15, 29. 2. Match. 12, 43. We may satisfy for the Dead
may be Baptized for them, as Saint PAVL says: that is, may by their
afflictions and penance (which is a baptism of Cypr. sermon. de Caena Dom et in
proaem l de exhort. ad Martyr. Greg Naz. orat de Epiph. Mar. 10, 38. Luc. 12,
50. Three principal effects of our good works.
tears) make recompense for their sins. Which will be somewhat for our
purpose hereafter.

And for the better understanding of this point, thou shall understand good
Reader, that our good works way be in 3. sorts beneficial unto us from God.
They may be Meritorious, Satisfactorious, and Impetratorious, that is,
obtaining at Gods hands any good thing. They are Meritorious in yt they be
done in grace, for no good work shall pass unrewarded: and therefore every
particular good work done in Gods grace, deserves of Almighty God through
his liberality and by the Merits of Christ, (which to one being in Gods favor
are undoubtedly communicated) both increase of grace, and such degree of Gods
glory in heaven, as is correspondent to that grace. They are satisfactorious,
in that they be laborious and painful. For these are two distinct things in
every good work: to proceed of grace and Charity; and to be a painful
exercise. The one deserves a mutual love of God, unto which is annexed a
reward: the other makes just and equal payment for a deserved punishemente.
And although there be three special works of satisfaction, Prayer, Alms, and
Fasting, as has been said; unto which al other are reduced: yet whereas (as
the Philsophers do teacch) the obiecte of virtue is difficult for the
corruptnesse of our nature: there is no virtuous work either inward, or
outward, but besides that it is Meritorious, it is also Satisfactorious. They
are finally Impetratorious, or obtaining of God: in as much as they are either
Prayers, or any thing offered unto God by way of Petition, or demand. Which I
add for that any Satisfactorious work may not only be directed for the
behalf of another as it is Satisfactorious, but if it be deuoutely offered
for the obtaining of any good thing for our Neighbor, it is also
Impetratorious, and a kind of Prayer. As if one should Receive, or Fast, to
obtain for his brother health, or any virtue. And this effect of obtaining is
founded in the liberality of our Savior and promise, yt whatsoever we shall ask
in his name he will grant unto us.

Now of these three things certain it is that the first redoundeth only to
the good of him wc w rketh. Eccles. 16, 15 Romans 2, 6.
For all mercy shall make a place to every man according to the merit of his
works: no pure creature having this privilege to merit for any other: that
being the privilege of Christ alone who having no need of merit himself for
the glory of his own soul, it being endowed with all wisdom grace and glory
even from the first moment of his conception, deserved grace and glory for us
al. Who therefore is compared unto a Nurse. For every other person by his
ordinary nutriment receiving benefitte and substance for himself alone: the
nurse eats for her self, and for her child. But the other two may
effectually be done for others, for as a man may pray for another: so may he
also satisfy for another, if both be in grace: as we have proved, Exodus 32,
32 Romans 9, 3. Genesis 18, 33.
and may be understood also by MOISES and S. PAVL, who desired of God to
satisfy for their peoples fault: and by those just, which if they had been
found in SODOM, should have saved the wholle City. Yet there is here to be
observed, that although those which are in deadly sin be not wholly excluded
from the communication of the meritts of the Church: this is only in respect
of her prayers in which they are included, and of a certain kind of meritte
which the Divines call DE CONGRVO of conueniency, far inferior to that which
we spoke of, and of no certainty. But of this satisfaction by way of Justice:
they are no way partakers: because they be dead members.

Thirdly hereof does follow that necessarily we must admit some works of
Supererogation, 3 Works of Supererogation. See page 410
which may be understood of two sorts. First, those are called works of
Supererogation, which belong to the Evangelical Counsels: of which enough
has been said before. Secondly, those are called works of Supererogation,
which although in respect of Meritte, they be profitable to the person by
which they be wrought: yet in respect of their Satisfaction which they have in
them, were not necessary to the doers of them. They having not in Gods
judgment deserved so much penalty as they here suffered: their everlasting
punishment first being remitted; if ever they deserved it: which I add,
because of our Blessed LADY who was never subject to such deserte. Such a one
was first our Blessed LADY, the most abundant fountain next unto Christ of
al Meritte and Satisfaction. Col. 1, 24.
Such another was Saint PAVL who as he says himself suffered for the wholle
body of Christ. Such a one was also the holy Patriarche JOB by Gods own
judgment and testimony approved. Job 42.7. Job 6, 2.
who although he confessed that he had deserved wrath: yet he bouldly says
that the calamity which he suffered in respect of his deserts was heavier
than the sand of the sea: Such were the holy Christians of Jerusalem whom S.
PAVL says to have had abundance of spiritual treasures: 2. Cor. 8, 14.
Such also no doubt were the holy Apostles and infinite Martyrs and other
Saints of God. Genesis 16, 12.
And here no doubt an Heretic like a reprobate Ismaelite whose hands are
against al, and all hands against him, who always pitcheth his tenthes
opposite to his Brethren: will scoff and taunt, uttering the wholle stoare and
talent of his scurrill religion. But how shall we avoid him? for if we
exaggerate our sins, and humbly seek to confess them: then are we
superstitious, and butchers of our own consciences: if we with all humility
1. Cor. 1, 31.
glory in our Lord who has by his blessed Passion given such pretiouse 2.
Pet. 1, 4.
gifts unto us, that we 1. Io. 3, 1.
may be the sons of God, and receive 2. Cor. 1, 22.
the pledge of his spirit in our hearts, and have him Mat. 10, 20. 2. Cor. 13,
3.
speaking and Phil. 2, 13. 1. These. 2.13.
working within us, by whose instinct and influence To. 8, 3.
we may do works acceptable unto God: then do we depresse the merittes of
Christ's death: and are enemies unto his grace. If we be very severe in exacting
rigorous Penances as in the Primitive Church: than do we trust too much in our
own Satisfaction. If with the lenity and mildness of Christ and his Apostles,
we remitte due and necessary Satisfactions; then we usurp the office of
Christ to pardon sins.

Quo teneam nodo mutantem Protea vultus? Mat 11, 18.
So was Saint IHON Baptist by the Jews reprehended for too much austeritie, and
our Savior for his kind and liberal conversation.

But letting alone al large discourses of this points least we should make a
long volume: to a Catholic, whom I intend only here to instruct, this
which I will now add, shall be a sure demonstration. For if one be a Martyr,
An evident argument for works of Supererogation.
both according to the holy Scriptures and to the wholle consent of Fathers and
practice of the Church, his only death is a sufficient satisfaction for all his
temporal punishment. Now if he do not only die for justice, but be most
barbarously Whipped, Mocked, Racked, and Mangled, and that without any respect
of ordinary humanity, as we know to have been done in the Primitive Church:
O let Number. 23, 10.
my soul die with the death of the just: how Psa. 115, 15.
pretiouse in the sight of God is the death of his Saints? our Lord Psalm. 23,
31.
keeps all the bones of them, one of them shall not perish: what
superaboundance of Passions is here? Now these and such like works: in that
they were Meritorious, are rewarded in their own persons with glory: but in
that they are Satisfactorious: Col. 1, 24.
they accomplish that which wants in the Passions of Christ for his body.
They shall not want their correspondence of deserved remission applied unto
others their fellow members. No otherwise than when nature having served the
vital members with due nourishement, afterward deriueth her liberality unto
all other parts of the body. And thus much of works of Supererogation.

Fourthly hereof now is heaped an infinite mass, The Treasure of Indulgences.
or treasure of the Satisfactions of Christ and of his Saints, that is, of the
wholle mystical body of Christ. which is called the treasure of Indulgences.
For all the benefit of our satisfactions is first applied to our own
necessities (if we do not otherwise apply them to the good of our neighbor,
which we may do with very great Charity, although we need them our selves)
But if there be any thing in them superfluous unto any Saint for his own
paiments, not applied by himself in the very doing of them for some other:
than are they laid up in the Churches Treasure, to be applied as she shall
with her wisdom decree. Now therefore out of al these infallible
foundations, I gather my purpose in this manner.

An invincible reason for Indulgences.
There is a sufficient treasure in the Church for to recompense the wholle debte
of temporal punishment, which is in all the lively members of Christ: But
such treasure may be applied unto these members, by those which govern the
family of Christ: therefore may those which govern this family, pardon and
remitte unto them the temporal punishment for sins. Which reason is so
manifestly deduced out of that which went before, that we need not to make any
larger discourse.

10 Diverse Illations out of the Premises, concerning the nature of Pardons.

1 A Pardon is not only an absolution, but also a ^ compen^ation for sins.
TO conclude this wholle Treatise of Indulgences, we may gather out of that
which is said: First, that although a Pardon be principally and properly an
absolution from the debte of punishment; given by the virtue of the KEYS: Yet
is it also a kind of compensation withal. For the Prelate granting a Pardon,
does so absolve the Penitent, that he makes out of the treasure of the Chuch,
an equal paimenr unto Almighty God for the wholle debte: paying in the head,
and in other members, that which should without his sacred authority have been
paid by the party himself. Or thus more plainly, for the capacity of the
simpler sort: a Pardon is a merciful release in respect of the Penitente:
but in respect of Gods justice, an equal payment, made by the merits of
others, applied for a recompense of the Penitent his sins. And herein we may
see how this absolution differs from the Sacramental absolution in penance.
How Pardons differ from ye Sacrament of Penance.
For there, is applied only the Merits of Christ, and not of his Saints:
whereas their merits could not reach unto the taking away of the sins
themselves, nor of the everlasting pain due unto the same. But here the
merittes also of the Saints in as much as they are Satisfactorious, do take
place. God having so disposed, that according to ye sweet government of his
Church, his members do in the course of their justification and delivery from
all punishements, what they are able: they being able by the concourse of his
Spirit now dwelling within them to satisfy for temporal pain. Besides, in
Penance the wholle everlasting pain is taken away, but here not always the
wholle temporal correction, but so much only as it pleases the giver,
according to the proportion of the cause. Finally the Sacrament is an
instrument of Christ's eternal Priesthood, in which he himself remitteth
sins by the instrumentary ministry of his priest: But in Indulgences the
Prelate is properly the worker, by his authority received from Christ: neither
is it necessary that he be a Priest or Bishop, if he have jurisdiction: which
may be in a Bishop elected and yet not consecrated.

Secondly, 2 Only Bishops ca^ give Pard^^
we infer that only Bishops can give Pardons to those which are of their
Diocese: and that not only for the restrainte made by the Church: but also
for the very nature and condition of Pardons. For although unto all Priests be
said whose sins soever you forgive they shall be forgiven: yet is this
authority always understood according to the necessary regiment which Christ
has ordained in his Church. And therefore a Priest cannot by his Priesthood
alone absolve, except he have jurisdiction also. Likewise an ordinary Priest,
although he be a Parish Priest, and have cure of souls, cannot excommunicate:
and yet that authority belongs unto the Keys of the Church. These things
therefore do require such sovereign authority as is in the chief governors
and Prelates of the Church: and espeacialy in this present case: where the
common treasure of the family being dispensed, there must of necessity be had
the consent of the ruler of the same, which is every Bishop.

3 Bishops power in granting Pardons, is justly limited.
Thirdely we may gather, that the POPE in limiting the Indulgences of Bishops,
has not done them any injury at all. For the Bishop has not authority over
the works of any which are not his subjects. And those also being once dead
belong no more to his diocese, than to another: and consequently the
application of their Merittes is out of his jurisdiction. Wherefore his
particular treasure being so uncertain (for it may so fall out that in his
wholle Diocese there may be very few superfluous satisfactions) the POPE in
limiting him has provided for all inconveniences, least the Bishop deceive the
people, in promising more than he may perform: which in sacred matters is a
pernicious thing. And moreover, it is very probably to be thought, yt the POPE
has allowed those Indulgences which Bishops may give, as out of the common
Treasure of the wholle Church, and so there can be no doubt of the value of
them at al, nor any injury in restraining the Bishop, who is rather helped
thereby.

Fourthly hence appears the reason, 4 None ca^ receive Indulgence with b^ in
deadly sin.
why an Indulgence cannot be received by him which is out of Grace. For Grace
is necessary to participate ye benefit of other men's Satisfactions. And the
Indulgence gives me only so much as my own Satisfaction could do: but my
Satisfaction were nothing done out of Gods favor: therefore can the
Indulgence here avail me nothing.

Fifthly we may now understand what difference there is between the
Satisfaction of others applied by the Church: and by one man unto another. 5 He
wc satisfies for an other does not grant Indulgence
For he which applies his own Satisfaction to another, cannot surely know
whether himself be in Grace, and consequently whether his Satisfaction be
accepted of God: But these Satisfactions applied in Indulgences are most
certain. Besides: another man applying his Satisfaction for my relief, does
not absolve me from my debte of Satisfaction, but only pays for me. Wherefore
I am still bound to fulfill my Penance, that being a mere personal work to
be undertaken by my self: But the contrary is in Indulgences as has been
declared before. Last of al, after the work is past, we cannot apply the
Satisfaction of it unto our neighbor: but it either helps our selves, or if
it were not necessary for our selves, it goes into the common treasure: But
the Church applies the Satisfactions of works which are past to our relief
in Indulgence.

Sixthly, he which receives an Indulgence, 6 Public nance enioined, is not
always taken away by Pardon.
is bound notwithstanding to fulfill all Penances which are publickely enioined
him. For indulgences only take place in the court of Conscience, and between
God and us: unless it be otherwise expressed. And those Penances are to
Satisfy the world scandalized by our faults, and to be a warning for others
from committing the like.

7 No blasphemy in saying that by Pardon, recompense is made to God.
Seauenthly it is no blasphemy to say that in Pardons is made an equal
recompense for pains of sins unto Gods Justice. For it is Christ which
paieth, and makes this recompense out of the merits of his whole body, that
is, his own, and his Saints merits. For he has entered into so strait a
society with his members, that they accomplish that which wants of his
Passions in their flesh. But it is no blasphemy to say that Christ's merits
make an equal recompense for sins.

11 Of Pardons for the Dead.

FInally, we hence infer that Pardons may be granted unto the Dead, who
in the unity of CHRIST'S body, have departed this life: and that in as
infallible a manner (if the cause be sufficient) as unto those which are
alive: yet not by way of absolution, but by way of Suffrage, which we will
forthwith expound. For it is to be understood: See page 219 Three kind of
Suffrages for ye dead.
yt the souls departed out of this world, and in Purgatory suffering the
chastisement of God: may, as above has bin showed out of S. AUGUSTINE, be
helped by those which are alive, three ways. First, by ye holy Sacrifice of
the MASS: which is undoubtedly propitiatory for the quick and the dead.
Secondly, by the prayers of the Church, and of other devout Christians.
Thirdly by Alms, or any other Penal work done for them. And concerning the
first: because it is not our own work, but the very work of Christ himself:
we will not here speak thereof. The second is founded as we said before, in
the mere liberality of Christ, without any certain promise. For although God
infalliblely does hear and grant the Petition of one which is in grace, when
he prays for himself, D. Thom. 2.2. quaest. 83. artic. 15.
and for necessary things unto salvation, and with humility and perseverance:
yet when he prays for another, either alive or dead, there is no such
certainty and infallibility of obtaining. Because we know not, whether, or how
far God accepts our prayer, nor the disposition of the other. The like is
to be said of that imperfecte kind of Merit, which is called DE CONGRVO of
Congruity or Conueniency: For oftentimes one which is in grace meriteth for
another man either alive or dead, many good things: yet because herein is no
certain Law or promise of God, or reason of Justice betweeene him and us: as
there is in the other merit of condignity, which we spoke of before: there is
no certainty but all left to the secret disposition of God. But the third
thing, which is to offer for them which are dead in Christ either Alms, or
Fasting, or any other work of Satisfaction, yea, and Prayer, in as much as it
is Satisfactorious, because of the labor thereof: has an infallible effect,
even of justice for to satisfy for their pains. Yet so that the offerer be in
grace. The reason of this, is, that which we touched before, for that they be
of the Communion of Christ's mystical body: and in great need of help: and
therefore do receive the influence from the head, as other members do. And
as there is an equality of Justice in the satisfaction of one just man offered
for another being alive: so also is there the same kind of justice, in the
same satisfaction, offered for the dead. Prayer is two ways profitable unto
the Dead.
Wherefore it is very profitable for him which prays for the dead, not only
to offer his prayer to obtain mercy for him: but also to offer unto God that
very labor of praying for him. For in this respect it is satisfactorious, and
has an infallible effect for him: in the other respect it is impetratorious,
and has no certain promised measure of benefit, but only according to Gods
mere liberality, the devotion of the party which prays, and the estate of
the party deceassed considered. Yet do I not doubt but that always something
is also obtained, when the satisfaction is available. For it belongs to Gods
merciful liberality to bestow where we by, his gracious permission and promise
do bestow: so that it is very convenient to think that if in such prayer the
satisfaction be sufficiently derived to the dead by our application: God also
by hearing the same Prayer does liberally grant our request in part, and add
somewhat to the value of our small recompense which we make for our Brother.
Yet as the quantity is uncertain so may it be much more, the devotion of the
prayer being fervent, than that wc proceeds from the certain limited fruit
of the satisfaction.

These helps therefore which we may afforde unto ye souls departed: are called
the Suffrages of ye Dead.

Now eue^ as in those which are alive, by the Indulgences of the Church,
recompense is made for that te^porall punishment which they a^e deserved: so
also may the same Indulgences take away the debtes of those which are departed,
and that as infallibly, as they are profitable to those which are in this
world.

For this is the wholle course of an Indulgence in this life. PETER owes unto
Almighty God great Penance: and because men which are alive may apply their
satisfactions for PETER'S relief: therefore may the POPE out of the Treasure of
the wholle Church yield unto PETER convenient relief: of which infallibly
PETER shall be partaker if he be in grace: and a recompense of justice is made
unto God for PETER'S debte. Even so is it in the dead: who for that they may be
partakers of common Suffrages of the Church: may by Indulgences receive a
perfect supply of that which by the suffrages they may receive.

This do the Divines call, Per modu^ Suffragij.
and it is so also called in the ordinary Pardons, By way of Suffrage: that is,
not as some do miss understand it: as if the meaning of such a Pardon were,
if they can obtain it of God, they shall deliver a Soul out of Purgatory: for
then the Pardon could not be of certain force for the dead: But the sense is:
they shall deliver a Soul out of Purgatory: even as if they had done so much
of ordinary Suffrages for them, as were sufficient for the wholle effect of the
Indulgence. This shall be more clear if we consider, the cause of this manner
of speech, which was this. To those which live in this world: Indulgences are
not only recompenses made to God for our debte: but also a proper absolution:
The POPE absoluing us, and paying that which we owe out of the Treasure. Now
the POPE having no authority or jurisdiction over the dead, he cannot absolve
them: yet as he may and all other Christians may by common Suffrages yield
them convenient help: so may he supply such help by applying out of the
Treasure, that which may be available unto them.

And therefore although he does not absolve the^, as not being their judge: yet
he applies to their certain benefitte and relief the common satisfactions of
Christ and of his Saints, which he has in his custody. Wherefore when he
says: I grant this Indulgence by way of Suffrage, it is as much as if he
said: I do^ not absolve the^, Pardons for de^d ^equire a just cause.
but apply unto the^ so much of Ecclesiastical help, as may sufficiently
recompense for the^. But even in these Pardons also is required a just and
convenient cause, without the which they shall have either none, or not so
great force as the words do sound^ is we said before. The like also is to
be judged of the estate of grace of him which obtains the Indulgence for the
dead* Grace is not always required in him which ^^^teth an Indulgence for ye
dead.
yet with some difference, between these Indulgences, and those which are
granted to them which live in this world. For two manner of works may the
POPE require in Pardon for the Dead. The first, are works which have no other
goodness in them, than that which they have of s^e^d^e^, as if the Pardon
should run thus. Whososoeuer visits this Church, or says such a Prayer,
etc. shall deliver a soul out of Purgatory. And such things being done out of
Gods grace, because without his (...) the work has ^o goodness in it: there
cannot be a sufficient cause of Pardon: and therefore the Pardon avails
nothing Other works, may have some goodness in themselves, or in some
extrinsecal thing: although they have ^^ne by the doer. As if this should be
the form of the Indulgence. Who says MASS, or causes to be said MASS for
such a cause, or gives Alms for the maintenance of such a place; shall deliver
a soul out of Purgatory. For certain it is that MASS and ALMS do good unto
ye Church, although they wh ch said it, or made them to be given, be not in
Grace.

And in such works, Navarre, and Sotus.
if by some circumstance the mind of the POPE be not gathered to the contrary;
that is, that he require that they be devoutly and with grace performed: then
may the Pardon be obtained for the dead by one which is not in grace. For here
the POPE grants the Pardon, for a just cause, which is Gods glory and honor
by those charitable works, and the other does nothing concur unto it, but by
determining the person to whom the POPE may apply it. Even so is it in the
Dirige, of a naughty Priest, offered for one that is dead (as for the MASS, it
is certain that it has effect of it self, without any respect to him which
says it, even for those for who^ a naughty Priest does offer it) Who if he say
this Dirige of his own devotion, and privately: it is nothing available. But
if he do it to fulfill the bond of the Church, whose Minister he is, or in the
Quire: than does it very much profit the Dead: for in this he bears the
person of the wholle Church. So also is it, if my man being in sin, give out
of my Purse by my consent, or general leave. Alms to the poor. For in these
examples the works are more ^f (...) ^ersons, than of those which do execute
th^^ (...) it in the Suffrages and Indulgen^^ (...) when the POPE respects
the w^^ (...) the goodness thereof in the effect (...) recite from a naughty
root from w^^ (...) no goodness at al. For in such a case, a^^ (...)
^ar^^^cantable of Pardon himself: yet (...) a work a^ mothers appointment
whereunto is annexed a Pardons for the Dead: although perhaps the work does
nothing profit the Dead, but only in as much as it does determine the POPES
application of Pardon to this Particular party deceased. No condition necessary
in this life for Pardon in Purgatory, or for participation of the suffrages of
the Church.
Neither is that necessary which some do require: that a man for to be helped
by Indulgences after his death, have had whilst he here lived, a special
devotion to the authority of the Church, and a diligent care to help the souls
departed, or a particular resolution to satisfy unto God in this life:
(although this last be singularly profitable to make at the least in the hour
of death:) For it is sufficient that one be in Purgatory: for then he is also
in Grace. And the want of those affections in life time, in a higher degree
than every Christian is bound unto, under pain of Mortal sin, although
perhaps it has increased the debte in Purgatory: yet can it not hinder the
common influence of Christ's Passion, and the participation of the Churches
Suffrages, or of the Treasure of Indulgence.

12 The conclusion of this Treatise: and of the fruit of Indulgences.

THus much have we said according to the most sound opinions of Learned
Divines, of this (...) ^^dulgences. Which for that it was (...) ^^IONIS ET
PETRA SCAN^^ (...) offense, and a rock of scandal to (...) stumbling made
Israel to sin: (...) which follow his Doctrine, a com^^^ (...) blasphemy
against the CHVRCH: (...) it my part to handle more largely, than the purpose
of this BOOK did require. If nothing will suffice them, no reason content
them, no authority convince them: then let them know that they, being out of
the number of GODS Children, can never be troubled with Purgatory, nor with
Pardons, which have relation unto Purgatory. The one being a place of
correction for children, the other a merciful favor exhibited unto the same
children. But of them which despise this Rod of Discipline of our Almighty
Father, and contemn his Indulgence and Mildness: is said of the Apostle.
Heb. 12, 8.
If you be without Discipline, whereof all be made partakers: than are you
Bastards, and not children. And that of the Prophet. Esa. 11, 4
He shall strike the earth with the Rod of his mouth: and with the breath of
his lips he shall kill the wicked.

But we whom God of his infinite mercy has united unto his mystical body of
the holy Church; as we must of necessity, if we will remain in the same unity,
acknowledge and reverence the sacred authority and power of giving Indulgences:
so in seeking with diligence to obtain them, we shall reap three singular
benefittes. Three sing^lar profits o^ Indulgences.
First we shall receive increase of meritte, and consequently of grace in this
life and glory in the other: whilst we deuoutely perform those good works,
unto which always we are invited by Indulgences. Secondly we shall obtain the
release of the pains of Purgatory, by diminishing in our mortal life the
debte thereof: which by those which fear the corrections of God, and consider
how far, as S. AUGUSTINE says In Psalm. ^
those pains exceed whatsoever can be suffered in this life: will be judged a
great felicity. Thirdly we shall shorten the time of our absence from God
after our departure from hence, and hasten that happy vision wc God promised to
MOISES when he said: I will show thee all good. Ex. 33, 1.
Which acceleration of so great a good, how pretiouse it is, well understood S.
PAVL, Phil. 1, 23.
who so earnestly desired to be dissolved, and to be with Christ: And that
other devout soul which complaining of the length of her Pilgrimage and
dwelling amongst the inhabitants of dark and sorrowful CEDAR, Ps. 119, 5.
did wast and consume with the desire of entering into the heavenly Courts.
Ps. 83, 3.
In which, if according to the infallible verity of Gods word one day be far
better than thousands of worldly treasures: Ps. 83, 11.
then surely that which not only delivers from misery, but hasteneth and
anticipateth, so many years and days of so great a bliss, giving also such
help and occasion of a higher mansion in so rich a house: Io. 14, 2.
cannot be valued with the treasures of wholle Kingdoms. Psalm. 62, 2.
Come therefore, O you, who wander abroad in the deserte, desolate, and
withered land of Heresy and Schism: Come unto the waters: and you which have
not silver; make haste, and buy, Esa. 55, 1.
and eat: Come and buy without amy exchange, Wine and Milk. Why do your
spend your money and not in bread, why do you bestow your labor, and not in
satiety? Come unto these lively waters, which proceeding from the fountain of
life, will purge you from the mudde of your broken cisterns, and quicken you
with the spirit of God, Hier. 2, 12. ^o. 4, 14. ^o. 9, 2.
and spring up into life everlasting. Come drink of that wine, which the holy
wisdom of God has mingled unto you. And least you be terrified with the
expectation of your fathers severity, and discipline: behold your mother with
her naked breasts comes to meet you, ready to embrace you, and as newborn
Infants to nourish you with the milk of her clemency and kindness. ^^. 15, 22.
She brings with her your very first stole, wc you once received of her in
Baptism, and now again and again have defiled. And although that pure robe of
innocence with which then she adorned you, cannot be recovered: yet shall you
no doubt by her diligent care, and motherly piety, be clothed with an
unspotted garment of your recovered grace, and if you have hurt your
sovereign Lord and Father in any thing; or be in his debte: you being once
restored to his favor, she has wroten it with her own hand: she will repay
it. Whose voice if you will hear; Philem. verse. 18.
whose petition if you will grant; whose tears if you will respect: then
shall you in steed of wasting your substance riotously, by laboring unto
destruction, Mat. 13, 44.
and everlasting fire: convert most holsomely and profitablely your care and
labors to the buying of that hidden treasure, which shall fully recompense the
sale of all worldly riches.
