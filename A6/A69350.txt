Orders for thorow-Posts, and Curriers, riding in Post in Our Affairs.
THe lords of the Privy Council endeavoring heretofore the like furtherance
of the Service of the State, as well in horsing such as ride on their Princes
Affairs, as the speedy dispatch of Packets in all places, where Posts were
erected and ordained, considering, that for the service of the one, a daily Fee
is allowed, and for the other no certain wages at all, but the hire of the
Horses let out, and that often ill paid, whereby they stand not so bound to
the one, as to attend the other: And that the Towns and Countries besides
became many ways vexed and perplexed, by the over great liberty of riders in
Post, especially by such as pretend public Service by special Commission,
contrary to the Kings meaning, or their Lordships Orders: Who minding nothing
more, then the particular good of his Servants and subjects; for the benefit
of the one, relief of the other, and more regard to the good usage of all
Owners of Horses, and the beasts themselves, did think it expedient, to
digest and set down sundry necessary Orders indifferent for all parties to
observe and follow, Which Orders being by us reuiewed and considered, are now
according to the necessity of the times, thought meet to be estsoones allowed
and published. The execution whereof, we seriously recommending to the Master
and Comptroller of all Our Posts, for the better warranting and directing of
Posts, so far as this Service may concern them, We do hereby straightly
charge and command, all and every Lieutenants of Shires, deputy Lieutenants,
Justices of al Assizes and Peace, Sheriffs, Mayors, Bailiffes, Constables,
Headboroughs, and all other his Officers, Ministers, and loving subjects, to be
aiding and assisting to the same, with their utmost help, authority and
countenance where need shall require, as they tender the furtherance of the
service of the State, and our displeasure.

1. FIrst it is ordered, That in all places where Posts are laid for the
Packet, they also as persons most fit, shall have the benefit and pre-eminence
of letting, furnishing and appointing of Horses to all riding in Post, (that
is to say) with Horn and guide by Commission or other wise, And to that end
shall keep, and entertain of their own, or have in a readiness under their
direction, such and so many able and sufficient Posthorses, with convenient
furniture, as their own abilities will bear, or that the contributorie
provision of the Towns and Countries shall enable them unto, or afford. And if
it fall out that Curriers or Thorow-Posts, riding in our Affairs by special
Commission, come so thick, or in such numbers, that their ordinary provision
will not suffice, then the Constables of the places where they dwell, with the
assistance of the chief Magistrates there, and of the countries adjoining,
(being required in our name) shall take vy, bring in, and supply the Posts with
horses where they may be had or hired.

2 ANd like as in the Orders for the carrying of the Packets, the furtherance of
our service and the State is only aimed at, so in this it is intended, that
none be holden to ride on public affairs, but with special Commission, and
the same signed either by one of our principal Secretaries of State, or six
at the least of our Privy Council, or the Master and Comptroller general of
the Posts, for all iourneys outward, and from the Court only. And to the
Court, the Lords of the Privy Council of Scotland, any Lieutenant, Deputy of
Governors in Ireland, the Presidents of Councels, or Vicepresidents established
in the North, or in the Marches of Walls, the Governor of Barwiche, Any
Ambassador, Governors of Towns, or Agents beyond the Seas, The Warden of the
Cinque Ports, or his Lieutenant of Dover, specially sending to the Court, to
the body of the Council, or Secretaries of State, or any Pachet so directed,
that it may appear, the party dispatched there with, rides in our special
Affairs, (the Ambassadors of foreign Princes within this our Realm, and the
ordinary Posts for France and Flanders allowed, and by their badges
sufficiently commissionated, excepted) and of all such so riding in public
Affairs, it shall be lawful for the Posts, or the owners of the Horses to
demand for the hire of each Horse after the rate of two pence halfepeny the
mile, (besides the Guides groats.) But of all others riding Post with Horn
and Guide, about their private businesses, the hire and prices are lest to the
parties discretions to agree and compound within themselves.

3. IT shall not be lawful for any person whatsoever riding in Post by
Commission or other wise, to take and ride away the Horse or Horses of any man,
Post or other, not having first or aforehand fully paid and satisfied for the
price and hire unto the Owners or the Post for them, nor ride them further then
the next immediate Stage without changing, without the knowledge and consent of
the Post of the Stage, by whom he rides in Post, nor charge any Horse so
taken to ride in Post with any Male, or burden, (besides his Rider) that
exceeds the weight of thirty pounds: Neither shall any man so riding in Post,
offer to ride any man's Horse above seven miles the hour in Summer, viz. From
the first of April, till the last of September; nor above six in Winter,
which shall be accounted the rest of the year: And if any shall wilfully
disobey herein, or in any point hereof to the manifest hurt or hinderance of
the Horse his Owner, The Officers and Magistrates of the place upon complaint
made, shall stay the parties offending until they have given present
satisfaction, or sufficient security to repay the damage.

FInally, as it is only intended that our service in this kind, be at all
hands furthered, and the Posts to that end, in all their wants and wrongs to
right themselves by the help and authority of the Magistrates, Towns and
Countries as abouesaid: So if the service shall seem unto any Post a burden
ouergreat for his private state to bear and undertake, and the Towns and
Countries (notwithstanding the ease and quiet they reap thereby) no way
willing to countenance, encourage or enable him thereto: or otherwise in regard
of years or indisposition, shall not see reason to vnderlie the charge and
trouble of the service, as being a hinderance to his special duty in the
service of the Packet: The Post in such case attending his peculiar charge,
the Constables and Magistrates of the places shall take order from time to
time, that Horses be provided for all riding in Post by Commission, or
specially sent in our Affairs as beforesaid, in such fort as they were subject
to do before there were any Posts there, and as in places where are yet no
standing Posts at all. Unto whom also our pleasure is, that these Orders shall
be in force, and available (being delivered them from the Master and
Comptroller of the Posts) so far as they, and any branch of them may concern
the furtherance of public service, or their own relief.

Signed by his Majesty, and subscribed by Charles Stanhop Knight of the Bath,
Lord Stanhop of Harington, Master and Comptroller general of his Highness
Posts.
