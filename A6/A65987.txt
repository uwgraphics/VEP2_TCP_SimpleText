Unto those PEOPLE Who are called BAPTISTS.
FRiends,
in tender love to your souls is my soul drawn forth, for I see there is a zeal
among you, but is your zeal according to knowledge, whilst many of you are
professing, preaching, praying and worshipping, and yet stumbling at, and
contending against that in which alone all Worship, Prayers and Sacrifices is
accepted in the sighr of God? therefore this is the word of truth which I
testify unto you, that except your Worship, Prayers and sacrifices do proceed
and come from a measure of him in you who is the light of the world, in whom
alone the Father is well pleased, you are but warming your selves at your own
sparks which you have kindled, for which you must receive of the Lord a lying
down in sorrow: Therefore ye who are crying out of deceit and delusion; I say,
be not deceived, for God will not be worshipped or served but with his own seed
only; therefore weary him not with that which is yours, and take heed of
rejecting or slightting that measure of his own seed which he has given you to
serve him with, even that in you which moves contrary to the world, and
breathes after the Fountain from whence it came, that which searches the
heart, yea, the secrets therein, and makes manifest the deceit and hypocrysie
thereof, this is the seed of the kingdom in you, which is like a grain of
mustard seed, and this is the grace of God which brings salvation, and has
appeared unto all men for this end, to lead out of the dark paths of sin and
death and this is the light which shines in the dark heart of man, but the
darkness comprehends it not; but men loves the darkness rather then the light,
because it makes their cruel deeds manifest: and are not many of you strangers
to this light, having your hearts veiled over with thick darkness, whilst you
are professing and reading the Scriptures, and yet are questioning where they
declare of, or direct to a light within? Oh how has the God of this world
blind^d the eyes of many, who are stumbling at that which is given them to lead
out of darkness, even that sure word of Prophecy, unto which you might do well
to take heed, as unto a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawn,
and the day star arise in your hearts; but how can ye profess that ye know
God, whilst you are denying the light of his son within, in which the Father is
revealed, and by which that that may be known of God is made manifest in man;
or is there another way to come to the knowledge of God, then by his light
which shines in the heart, and gives the light of the knowledge of the glory of
God in the face of Jesus: Was not this the Apostles Doctrine, and the end of
their Ministry, to turn people from darkness to this light, that so they might
come to know him in them who is the light of the world, for they who know him
only outwardly after the flesh, they murdered him in whom the fullness of
Light, Life and power dwelt: because they knew him not that was from the
beginning, the word of life, the rock of ages, the bread that came down from
heaven, the flesh that was meat indeed, and the blood that was drink indeed,
they knew not, neither had they heard the voice of God, or seen his shape, at
any time, for they were erred and gone forth from that which would have made
him manifest, even the seed of that kingdom within them, which they were
seeking in observations without, and in the Scripture without they did think to
have eternal life; but unto him that was the life, of whom the Scripture
testified they would not come, but stumbled at the stumbling stone: now ye that
deny that Christ has enlightened all men with a light sufficient to lead to
salvation, whose faith is, that God has appointed a certain number before the
world was unto salvation, and unto them he affords grace sufficient to bring
them to the end appointed them, and that all others are reprobated to
destruction, and yet say, that God gives so much of his grace to them, as may
leave them without excuse, and that may be sufficient to condemn but not to
save them; notwithstanding, God declares, That he wills not the death of him
that dies, but rather that he would turn from his wickedness and live, and
that he has given his Son a light into the world, that it through him might be
saved, and that he would all men should be saved, and come to the knowledge of
the truth, and that he is no respecter of persons; but though your faith does
stand in respect of persons, will you therefore make God to be like your
selves, surely if you will but come down and own the wisdom of God, ye might
in it see your Principles to be such that even strikes at the root of the
Justice of God, limits his mercy, and makes him a respecter of persons, and
rherefore do I bear witness against it, and do affirm that Election and
Reprobation is not in respect or relation to persons, but in the two seeds,
between which God has put enmity, there has God past Election and
Reprobation, and all men as they are in the fall in sin and transgression are
under the curse and in the state of Reprobation, being joined unto that seed
where the curse and Reprobation is: therefore has God in his love given his
Son to redeem man out of that state, from under the power of the Serpent, again
unto himself, and into his power and Dominion, who is the seed unto which the
blessing is, and in whom the Election stands sure, unto as many as are in him,
who is the light, and of whose fullness all have a measure, even of the grace,
that brings salvation, which unto all has appeared, and the grace of God is
one, and is not divided, though some in their dark imagination^ distinguish
between grace sufficient, and grace not sufficient, or saving grace, and
preventing or restraining grace; but I say the grace of God is perfect, and the
least measure thereof is sufficient to save to the uttermost all those that
give up themselves to be led and guided by it; but the sloathfull servant hides
his Lords Talent, and then complains of his Lord, but he receives his portion
in utter darkness, whilst he that had improved his two talents, received his
portion with him that had ten; and this I testify that it is only by grace
that salvation is wrought, and not by any thing of man's own, for where grace is
truly owned, there self is as truly denied in all its willing and working; for
when that is owned and joined to, which is Gods power, then all man's work which
he has wrought, and all his fair buildings which he has framed in self, in
his own power and wisdom, though glorious in appearance, yet all must be
pulled down and an utter desolation must be known and witnessed of whatsoever
has been done out of the grace, out of the light, out of the life and power of
God: And therefore I say to you again, Be not deceived whilst you are saying
others are deceived and deluded; ye who are joined in that you call
Church Fellowship, by the outward form of washing, try your selves by the
witness of God in your consciences, whether you are yet truly come to the
fellowship of the Church that is in God, which is the pillar and ground of
truth; and whether you have known the baptism which is by fire; and have you
felt the flaming sword of the Lord killing the first nature in you, that which
has eaten the forbidden fruit, and has had its life in the pride, pleasures
lust, and vanities of the world? And have you known and felt the quickening
power of the Lord God raising up a seed, and bringing forth a birth in you
which is not of the world, but contrary thereunto? And are ye by it led forth
of the world, out of the evil and vanities thereof, bearing the daily cross?
Are you yet become as strange signs, wonders and gazing-stocks in the Earth?
Or are you not still in the world, and joined with them in their vvayes of
pride, pleasure and vanity, coveting to be rich in the things of this World,
which can give no satisfaction to the soul? And are you yet come out of the
customs and fashions of this world, such as are vain and idle, without any show
of purity or godliness, but manifest the heart unsavory, and the tongue
unbridled, yet are they covered with the name of civil things? And are you not
in the customs of the world, in respecting of persons, and in bowing and
bending to them, or rather to a spirit of pride in them, which seek the honor
of man; and thereby is that nourished and strengthened which must be brought
down, and laid low, even the lofty looks of man; for there is nothing
honorable in man but the image of God, and such as bears his image are humble,
meek and lowly, and seeks not the honor of man, neither can such bow to that
spirit of pride in any that seeks to be honored; and this custom is covered
with the Name of civil respect, or civil courtesy or carriage, and the like;
but the eye that is pure sees the root to be corrupt, and it no better then a
custom of the Heathen, and their fashions and customs are vain; and where the
pure life of God is witnessed, there the heathenish nature is slain, and the
vanity is trodden under foot: Therefore I say, Come all to the Witness of God,
the light in every one of your consciences, where all may know and read their
own conditions, and that none may take up a rest, and sit down at ease in a
profession without the life; but that such as profess the Name of the Lord
might know his power who makes the sinners in Zion afraid, and brings terror
upon the hypocrites, and might know God to be a devouring fire, and everlasting
burnings, in whose pure presence the workers of iniquity cannot stand nor abide
to dwell, but such as have innocent hands and a pure heart: Therefore let every
one that names the name of the Lord, depart from iniquity.

Some Queries as follows.
WHat command or commission have ye or any man to baptize with water from
Christ, declared of in any Scripture, which command did not as well extend unto
Paul, (who was an Apostle) as to any of you?

Whether the outward washing with water, (which is but the shadow) and John's
baptism; or the inward washing and cleansing by the spirit, (which is the
baptism of Christ) which of these (I say) is that one baptism which Paul wrote
of? Or why writes he but of one there If both must be continued? Whether such
do truly discern the Lords body, eat his flesh, and drink his blood, who do
imagine of the flesh, blood and bones of Christ as the Jews did? And whether
that flesh which is meat indeed, and that blood whlch is drink indeed, be not
spirittual, and that which quickens and nourishes up to eternal life all
those that feed thereon? And what then is the flesh that profits nothing? And
what is that flesh after which Christ was once known, yet henceforth know we
him so no more.

Now those whose minds are not carnal, nor their eyes outward, which look not
at things that are seen without, such only see and know the things that are
spiritual, the mystery that has been hid from ages, even the great mystery
of godliness, which is, God manifested in flesh, justified in spirit, seen of
Angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, and received into
glory.
