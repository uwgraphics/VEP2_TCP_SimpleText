THE PREFACE.
I Would not have the Reader think that I approve of every thing related in
this Historical Account. That which I think my self concerned to make good is
this,

1. That what I do relate as History, is Historically true, or that it is
delivered without fraud, or wilful perversion of the Authors cited.

2. That what I lay as the Foundation of my Inferences is sufficiently
confirmed by what I have delivered in this History.

That may, perhaps, be useful for many other ends relating to our Late happy
Change, but they are obvious in themselves, and were not chiefly designed by
me, and therefore are not mentioned here.

Farewell.
THE CONTETNS.
SECTION I. THAT from the Norman Conquest, to this present time, there was an
Original Compact or Establishment of Laws, by which the Kings of England were
to Govern, and the People to be governed. Page 1 Sect. II. That they thought it
absolutely necessary, that whosoever would be their King, should make this
Compact with them, and be as much obliged by Oath to grant these Privileges to
them, as they were to swear Allegiance to him. p. 6 Sect. III. That when the
ancient Laws of their Country were wholly violated, they constantly complained
of the Injustice of the Action, required the observation of them; and when they
could not prevail by fair means, they sought to recover their Right by Arms.
Where an account is given of the Barons Wars for the preserving of the Magna
Charta, and the Charta de Forestis. p. 14 Sect. IV. That we find throughout the
History of our Kings, that their Election, or else their Compact with the
People, has generally been conceived a thing proper to strenghen their Title
to the Crown, or at the least to satisfy their People, p. 35 Sect. V. That we
find mention in History of diverse Acts of Parliament, or of the Nobles of the
Kingdom, continuing the Name and Honor of a King to him, who, by their own
confession, had not the immediate Title to the Kingdom, and only proclaiming
him, who had the Right by Proximity of Blood, Heir Apparent to the Crown, p. 40
Sect. VI. The Inferences from the Resolutions of the best Casuists, to prove
that the Oath of Allegiance, and of the Coronation, are reciprocal; and
consequently that the obligation of the Oath of Allegiance does cease, when the
Original Compact is Fundamentally violated, p. 43
AN HISTORICAL ACCOUNT OF THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT.
SECTION I. That from the Norman Conquest, to this present time, there was an
Original Compact or Establishment of Laws, by which the Kings of England were
to Govern, and the People to be governed.
I Am apt to think it may be want of due consideration of the History, and
Constitution of our Government, which makes some worthy Persons of the Clergy
so stiff in their refusal of the Oath of Allegiance to King William, and Queen
Mary. Now the great mischief which this unhappy Division may bring upon the
Protestant Religion, both at home and abroad, and the vile Imputations which
are cast on that great Body of the Clergy which has taken this Oath, will
justify our Endeavors to set this matter before them in the clearest light,
and to let others know what has been done by our Forefathers to secure their
Laws and Liberties; what Compacts they made with their Kings; how uneasy they
were under the Violation of them, and what Conceptions they had touching the
Nature and Constitution of the English Government, and touching the Allegiance
due to their Prince. Now in order to these things, let it be observed,

First, Ubi Aldredus Archiepiscopus, Wulfunus Wigorniensis Episcopus, Clito,
Eadgerus Comites, Eadwinus and Morcarus and de Lundonia quique Nobiliores, cum
multis aliis ad eum venerant, and datis obsidibus illi deditionem fecerunt,
fidelitatemque juraverunt, cum quibus and ipse foedus pepigit. Dunelm p. 195.
Flor. Wig p. 635. R. Hov. F. 258.
That Florence of Worcester, Simeon of Durham, and R. Hoveden expressly say,
That William, called the Conqueror, made a League, or Compact with the
Archbishops, Bishops, Earls, and Nobles of the Land, who met him at Beorcham.

Secondly, That the aforesaid Authors, with John Brompton, Daniel p. 36.
declare, That as the Bishops and Barons of the Realm swore Fealty to him, Ipso
Nativitatis die ab Aldredo Eboracensium Archiepiscopo in Westmonasterio
consecratus est, honorifice prius, ut idem Archipraesul ab eo exigebat, ante
Altar Sancti Petri-Apostoli, coram Clero and populo, jurejurando promittens se
velle Dei Sanctas Ecclesias, and earum Rectores defendere, necnon and cunctum
populum sibi subjectum just, and Regali providentia vere regere, rectam legem
statuere, and tenere, etc. Flor. Wigorn. p. 634, 635. Dunelm. p. 195. Hoved. F.
258. Chron. Joh. Brompt. p. 962.
so he reciprocally, being required so to do by the Archbishop of York, made
his Personal Oath before the Altar of St. Peter to defend the Holy Church of
God, and the Rectors of the same, to govern all the People subject to him
justly, to establish equal Laws, and to see-them duly executed.

And when new Commotions were made by the Nobility, and Clergy, upon their
Submission, and Oath of Allegiance re-taken, he himself takes his Personal Oath
again before Archbishop Lanfranc, Daniel p. 37.
and the Lords, for the good of Peace, to observe the Ancient Laws of the
Realm, Occurrerunt igitur Angli memorati, ubi post multas disceprationes,
praesente Archiepiscopo Lanfranco, Rex, pro bono pacis, juravit, tactis
Sacro-sanctis Evangeliis, bonas and approbatas antiquas Regni leges, quas
Sancti and Pii Angliae Reges ejus Antecessores, and maxim Edvardus statuit,
inviolabiliter observare, and sic pacificati ad propria laeti recesserunt. M.
Paris in vita 23. Monach. p. 30.
established by his Predecessors the Kings of England; and especially of Edward
the Confessor; and this so pacified the English, that they went joyfully to
their own homes.

Thirdly, Matthew of Westminster says, Et sic revocatis multis Anglorum
Nobilibus, foedere cautius cum omnibus confirmato, Eboracum, ubi fuit Danorum
receptaculum, potenter cum ibi inventis, expugnavit. A. D. 1069.
That when the two Sons of Swain came into England to fight against it, the
Conqueror recalling many of the English Nobles, made a League with them, and by
their Aid he overcame the Danes. And that this League contained the Grant of
their Rights and Liberties, or the Laws of their Country, is evident from what
follows in the same Historian, viz. That the Conqueror being thus secured, in
many things violated his promises, taking from the Churches, and Monasteries in
which they lay the Charters, in which the Nobles of England. confided, Jam
factus securior, in multis promissa violavit, Monasteria totius Angliae
perscrutari fecit, and pecuniam simul cum Chartis, in quarum libertatibus
Nobiles Angliae-confidebant, and quas Rex, in arcto positus, observaturum se
juraverat, ab Ecclesiis, ubi in securo positae erant, auferri praecepit
violenter. Ibid. p. 226.
and to which he had sworn when he was in straits.

Fourthly, R. Hagulstadensis, S. Dunelmensis, R. Hoveden, M. Paris, Henry of
Knyghton, and W. of Malmsbury inform us, That Henry the first granted to all
the People the Laws of Edward, with the emendations which his Father had made
of them, strengthening them with his own Oath, Legem R. Edvardi vobis reddo cum
aliis emendationibus, quibus pater meus eas emendavit consilio Baronum suorum.
R. Hagulst. p. 311. Dunelm. p. 225, 226. Hoved. par. 1. p. 268. M. Paris p. 38.
Henr. de Knight. p. 2374. Malms. l. 5. F. 88. Hoc quoque praecipimus, ut omnes
habeant, and teneant legem Edvardi Regis in omnibus rebus, adauctis iis quas
constituimus ad utilitatem Anglorum. Apud Seld. Annot. ad Eadm. p. 192.
and the Oath of all his Nobles, that they might not be eluded; And W. Lambard
cites this as one of the Laws of W. the Conqueror. This also we command, That
all Men have, and keep the Law of King Edward, with the additions we have made
to them for the benefit of the English Men.

Fifthly, Postea ad preces communitatis Anglorum Rex adquievit, qui deprecati
sunt quatenus permitteret sibi leges proprias, and consuetudines antiquas
habere in quibus vixerant patres eorum, and ipsi in iis nati and nutriti sunt;
sc. leges Sancti Edvardi, and ex illo die magna Authoritate veneratae, and per
universum Regnum corroboratae, and conservatae sunt prae caeteris Regni
legibus, leges R. Edvardi. Chron. Eccl. Lichfield apud Seld. ibid. p. 171.
The Chronicle of Lichfield does inform us, That the whole Community of England
sued to the Conqueror that he would permit them to have the proper Laws, and
ancient Customs, in which their Fathers had lived, and under which they were
born, and educated, viz. The Laws of St. Edward; And that the King consented to
their Petition.

Sixthly, Attuli mecum de Londoniis leges aequissimi R. Edvardi quas dominus
meus Rex W. Authenticas esse, and perpetuas per totum Regnum Angliae
inviolabiliter observandas, sub poenis gravissimis, proclamarat, and suis
justitiariis commendarat, p. 88.
Ingulphus his Secretary, says, That he, under the severest penalties,
proclaimed, that the Laws of King Edward should be perpetual, authentical, and
be observed inviolably through the whole Kingdom of England, and as such he
commended them to his Justices.

Seventhly, R. Hoveden informs us, That he commanded the Laws of King Edward to
be observed in all things: and that in the fourth year of his Reign, by the
Counsel of his Barons, W. Rex, quarto Anno Regni sui, consilio Baronum suorum,
fecit summoneri per universos consulatus Angliae, Anglos Nobiles, and
Sapientes, and sua lege eruditos, ut eorum and jura and consuetudines ab ipsis
audiret. Electi igitur de singulis totius patriae comitatibus viri duodecim
jurejurando confirmarunt primo ut, quoad possent, recto tramite, neque ad
dextram neque ad sinistram partem divertentes, legum suarum consuerudinem and
Sancita patefacerent. Hoved. par. post. F. 343.
he made the Noble and Wise Men of England to be summoned throughout all the
Provinces of England, that he might hear from them, who were skilled in their
Law, their Rights and Customs; and that twelve Men were chosen out of every
County, who swore, to their power, to tread in a right Path, neither turning to
the right hand or to the left, and to make known to him the custom, and the
establishments of their Laws. And then he adds the very words contained in the
Chronicle of Lichfield.

Now all these things put together seem plainly to conclude an Original Compact
or Establishment of Laws, by which the Kings of England were to govern, and the
Kingdom to be governed; and the continuance, and renewal of that Establishment
by our succeeding Kings, Hist. Nov. F. 186. A. 25 H. 8. c. 21.
such as Malmsbury styles our Patriae Leges, and the Statute of Henry the
Eighth, the accustomed and ancient Laws of this Realm originally established.

Add to this then that Rule of Grotius, Successio non est titulus Imperii, qui
Imperio formam assignat, sed veteris continuatio, jus enim ab electione
coeptum, familiae succedendo continuatur, quare quantum prima electio tribuit,
tantum defert successio. De jure Bell and Pac. l. 1. c. 3. Sect. 10.
That Succession is not a Title of Empire which gives the form to it, but is
only a continuation of the old Title. The Right begun by the Election of the
Family, being continued by Succession. And thence, with him, we may reasonably
infer, that Succession only brings down to Kings what the first Election gave,
and makes them only Kings according to the Compact, and with the Conditions
agreed on at the first admission of their Progenitors to the exercise of the
Royal Authority.

SECT. II. That they thought it absolutely necessary, that whosoever would be
their King, should make this Compact with them, and be as much obliged by Oath
to grant these Privileges to them, as they were to swear Allegiance to him.
2dly. OUR Kings well knowing what a Reverence the Community had for their
Laws, found no better means to gain, or to secure to themselves the Crown, and
to pacify the discontented Parties, than by fair Promises, and Engagements to
maintain, or grant to them their Laws. Cum Regni fastigia fratri suo Roberto
praeriperet, coepit tam per se, quam per omnes quos poterat, fide,
sacramentoque Lanfranco promittere justitiam, aequitatem and misericordiam se
per totum Regnum, si Rex foret, observaturum, pacem, libertatem, securitatem
Ecclesiarum contra omnes defensurum. p. 13.
Eadmerus informs us concerning W. Rufus, that desiring to forestall his elder
Brother Robert in getting the Kingdom, he pawned his Faith and Oath, that if
they would make him King, he would in all things observe Justice, Equity, and
Mercy throughout his Kingdom, and defend the Peace, Liberty, and Security of
the Church against all Men.

When his Brother Robert was come into England to claim his right, and he had
many of the Nobility who favored him, and sided with him, W. Rufus calls the
Normans, and English Nobility to London, and leges statuens, Page 642.
and there stablishing the Laws, he marched with them against his Brother,
says Florence of Worcester. He bound them to him, says M. Paris, faciles
leges promittendo, Page 10.
by promising them easy Laws; as those of King Edward were by them styled, and
accounted. He sweetened them, says John Brompton, Page 984.
by promising that he would establish meliores leges quas sibi vellent eligere,
those more acceptable Laws which they would choose. Now those we know, by their
request in his Fathers days, were the Laws of Edward, and they with the
emendations of his Father, were the Laws then established. These Promises he
very little regarded after his agreement made with his Brother Robert; but
falling sick, at the suggestion of his Barons, he again promised to God, says
Radulphus de Diceto, Page 490, 491.
Rectas leges statuere, to stablish right Laws.

Henry the first, his Successor, in the beginning of his Reign, says Ipfe in
principio Regni sui leges justas and libertates populo dedit, charta
consirmavit, sigillo corroboravit. p. 310.
R. Hagulstadensis, gave to the People their just Laws and Liberties,
confirming them with his Charter, and his Seal. Dunelmensis, R. Hoveden,
Florence of Worcester, W. of Malmesbury, M. Paris, and Henry of Knyghton say,
that on the very day of his Qui consecrationis suae: die -- legem Regis Edvardi
omnibus in commune reddidit cum illis emendationibus quibus pater suus illam
emendavit. Dunelm. p. 225, 226. Hoveden p: 1. F. 268. B. Flor. Wigorn. p. 650.
W. Malmsbur. F. 88. M. Paris p. 38. H. de Knyghton p. 2374.
Consecration he granted to all his People the Laws of Edward, with the
emendations which his Father had made of them. Page 216. B. Chron. p. 997.
Henry of Huntington, and John Brompton say, that having promised a desirable
melioration of the Laws and Customs, he was consecrated by Maurice Bishop of
London. M. Paris says most expressly, that Henricus -- congregato Londoniis
clero Angliae, and populo universo, promisit emendationem legum quibus oppressa
fuerat Anglia tempore patris sui, and fratris nuper defuncti, ut animos omnium
in sui promotionem accenderet, and amorem, and ut illum susciperent in Regem
and Patronum. Ad haec clero respondente, and Magnatibus cunctis, quod si animo
volente ipsis vellet concedere, and charta sua communire illas libertates and
consuetudines antiquas quae floruerunt in Regno tempore Sancti Regis Edwardi,
in ipsum consentirent, and in Regem unanimiter consecrarent. Henrico autem hoc
libenter annuente, and se id facturum cum juramento affirmante, consecratus est
in Regem apud Westmonasterium. p. 38.
Henry, having assembled the Clergy, and all the People of England, that he
might dispose their minds to the love and the promotion of him, and the taking
him for their King, and Patron, promised them the emendation of the Laws by
which England had been oppressed in the time of his Brother, and that all the
Clergy and Nobility answered, That if he would freely grant to them, and
confirm by his Charter those Liberties, and ancient Customs which flourished in
the time of King Edward, they would unanimously consent to receive him for
their King; and that upon his Consent, and Oath to do so, he was created King
at Westminster. And when his Brother Robert came to challenge the Crown as his
by right of Succession, and the Concord made betwixt him and his Brother Rufus,
to animate his Subjects to stand by him, he speaks thus to them, Ego vero Rex
humilis and pacificus vos in pace in antiquis vestris libertatibus prout
crebrius jurejurando promisi gestio confovere -- omnia videlicet quae sanctus
Rex Edvardus, Deo inspirante, provide sancivit, inviolabiliter jubeo observari.
Ibid. p. 42.
I your mild King am desirous to preserve you in your Ancient Liberties, as I
have often promised upon Oath, -- And command all things to be inviolably
observed which holy King Edward, by the Inspiration of God, advisedly
established.

Steven succeeded him, and he, to get the Kingdom, Meliorationem legum promisit
juxta voluntatem and arbitrium singulorum M. Paris p. 51. R. Hagulstad. p. 314,
315. Chron. Jo. Brompt. p. 1024.

Bonas leges, and antiquas and justas consuetudines in Hundris and Placitis and
aliis Causis observabo. Rich. Hagulstad. p. 314.

Confirmavit Pacta quae Deo and populo atque Ecclesiae Sanctae in die
Coronationis suae concesserat Matthew. Paris p. 51.


promises a Melioration of their Laws according to their minds. Our Historians
tell us, That on the day of his Coronation he made a Compact with his Church
and People, which afterward at Oxford he swore to observe. And one of the
terms of this Compact was, That he would observe good Laws, and ancient and
just Customs in Hundreds, and Pleas, and other Causes.

Henry the Second follows him, at the beginning of his Reign, establishing
Peace in his Kingdom, and commanding the Laws of Henry the First, Ipse pacem
stabilivit in Regno, and leges Henr. Avi sui praecepit per totum Regnum suum
inviolabiliter teneri. Hoved. par. 2. F. 281. B.
his Grandfather, to be inviolably observed throughout his Kingdom.

Richard the first, succeeds him, and promises upon Oath at his Coronation
these three things, viz. 1. That he would give Peace, Honor, Juravit quod ipse
omnibus diebus vitae suae pacem, and honorem, and Reverentiam Deo, and Sanctae
Ecclesiae, and ejus ordinatis portaret. 2o. Quod rectam justitiam, and
aequitatem exerceret in populo sibi commisso. 3o. Quod malas leges and
consuetudines perversas, si quae in Regno suo inductae sunt, deleret, and bonas
leges conderet, and sine fraud and malo ingenio, eas custodiret. Hoveden. F.
374. A. M. Paris p. 108. Rad. de Diceto Imag. Hist. p. 647. Chron. Joh. Brompt.
p. 1157.
and Reverence to God, and the Church, and her Clergy all the days of his life.
2ly, That he would exercise true Justice and Equity to the People committed to
his Government. 3ly, That he would put away all evil Laws, and perverse
Customs, which were introduced into his Kingdom, and would make good Laws, and
maintain them without fraud and evil inclination. Conjuratus est ab
Archiepiscopo ex part Dei, and prohibitus ne hunc honorem acciperet, nisi in
mente habeat Sacramenta tenere quae fecit; and ipse respondit se, per auxilium
Dei, bona fide observaturum omnia supra dicta. Ibid.
Then the Archbishop of Canterbury conjures him by God not to take upon him
this Honor, unless he uprightly intended to perform what he had sworn; and
when he answered, That by the help of God he intended so to do, the Archbishop
puts the Crown upon his Head.

King John, at his entrance on the Government, took the same Oaths for
substance which his predecessor Richard had done, swearing to preserve the
Church and her Dignities from harm; to abolish unjust Laws, and to establish
Good, and to exercise right Justice; and he was also by the Archbishop conjured
not to take upon him the Kingly Honor, In coronatione sua R. Johannes triplici
involutus est Sacramento, viz. quod Sanctam Ecclesiam, and ejus ordinatos
diligeret quod perversis legibus destructis, bonas constituerer, and rectam
justitiam in Regno Angliae exerceret, deinde adjuratus est ab Archiepiscopo ex
part Dei, and districte prohibitus ne honorem hunc accipere praesumeret nisi
in mente habuit opere quod juraverat adimplere. Chron. Burton p. 256. R.
Hoveden F. 450. M. Paris p. 138.

Audistis quomodo ipse apud Wintoniam Regem absolvi, and ipsum jurare
compulerim quod leges iniquas destrueret, and leges bonas, viz. leges Edvardi;
revocaret, and in Regno faceret ab omnibus observari. M. Paris p. 166, 167.


unless he really intended to perform his Oath. When he was absolved from his
Excommunication by the Archbishop at Winchester, he was by him compelled to
swear, That he would destroy all unjust Laws, and would restore good Laws, viz.
The Laws of King Edward, and cause them to be observed of all throughout his
Kingdom.

King Henry the Third was but nine years old when he succeeded King John,
Annals Mon. Burton p. 271, 276.
and in the ninth year of his Reign he granted to all his Clergy, his Nobles,
and his People, his Magna Charta, and his Charter of the Liberties of the
Forest; and by these Charters he confirms to them libertates and liberas
consuetudines quas prius habuerant, the Liberties and free Customs which they
had before. M. Paris says, Page 274.
That he exacted the fifteenth part of the Movables, both of the Clergy, and
of the Laity, and that they promised to grant them, si illi diu petitas
Libertates concedere voluisset, Page 223.
provided he would give them the Liberties they had so long desired; And that
accordingly he gave them these two Charters, which were the same that had been
granted by King John. A. D. 1223. Speed p. 581.
The Barons requiring a confirmation of these Liberties from the King, William
Briwere, one of the King's Council, answered, That the Liberties which they
demanded were not to be observed, because they were violently extorted; the
King replied, All of us have sworn to these Liberties, and that which we have
sworn, all of us are bound to observe; and the truth is, at the conclusion of
the Peace with Lewis the King, Speed p. 578.
the Legate, and Earl Marshal swear that the King should restore to the Barons,
and others, all their Rights and Inheritances, with all the Liberties formerly
demanded of his Father. Speed p. 583
And in the year 1225. the King again drawn with the desire of Money, grants
those his Charters under his Seal, and Oaths were taken by Royal commandment to
tie all Men to the observation of the said grants.

Edward the first was declared King, and Successor of his Father when absent in
Palestine, and returning into England, is Crowned in the Second year of his
Reign, and in the Third calls a Parliament at Westminster, where he hears the
complaints of the ill Government of the Realm, and the Church, and makes that
wholesome Statute to relieve them which is called the first Statute of
Westminster.

At the Coronation of Edward the Second, the Earls and Barons of the Kingdom of
England treated of the State of the Kingdom, requesting the Banishment of Peter
of Gaveston from the Kingdom, and that Baronum suorum vellet consiliis tractare
Regni negotia, Hypadygm. Neustr p. 500.
he would transact the business of the Kingdom by the Councils of his Barons;
which the King denying to grant, Rex noluit consentire, idcirco proposuerunt
comites Coronationem Regiam impedire, quod Rex intelligens promisit bona fide
se facturum illis in proximo Parliamento quicquid peterent, tantum ne Coronatio
differatur. Walfingh. Hist. Angl. p. 96.
the Nobles endeavored to hinder his Coronation; which the King understanding,
promised faithfully, in the next Parliament, to do that which they desired.

At the Coronation of Richard the Second, one of the Bishops makes an Oration
to the People concerning the Constitution of the King and Kingdom, Tunc
Episcopus Sermonem fecit de materia Regis, and Regni ad populum, qualiter Rex
se haberet in populo, and in quibus populus sibi debuit obedire, quo completo
juravit Rex, coram Archiepiscopo and proceribus, quod Ecclesiam suis
permitteret gaudere libertatibus, and eam, and Ministros ejus honoratret. 2o.
Ut leges terrae bonas ubique observari faceret, and praecipue leges Sancti
Edvardi. 3o. Ut non esset personarum acceptor, etc. quibus expletis
Archiepiscopus convertit se ad omnes plagas Ecclesiae, indicans populo Regium
juramentum, and quaerens si se tali principi, and Rectori subjicere, and ejus
jussionibus obtemperare vellent; and responsum est a plebe -- quod libenter
sibi parere vellent. Walls. Hist. Angl. p. 195.
how the King should behave himself to them, and in what things they were to
obey him: this being done, the King swears before the Archbishop and Nobles,
that he would permit the Church to enjoy her Liberties, and would honor her
and her Ministers. 2dly, That he would cause the good Laws of the Land to be
observed every where, especially those of St. Edward. 3dly, That he would be no
acceptor of Persons, but would exercise right Judgment between man and man, and
especially would show Mercy. This being done, the Archbishop, the Marshal being
present, turns himself to all the quarters of the Church, declaring to the
People the Kings Oath, and asking them, if they could subject themselves to
such a Prince and Governor, and would obey his commands; to which they all
answered, That they would willingly do it.

Here then you see that William Rufus, Henry the First, and Steven, get the
consent of the People by virtue of this promise to grant them their usual Laws,
and ancient Customs, that Henry the First, Richard the First, and King John,
and Richard the Second at their Coronation oblige themselves by Oath to grant
them; And upon these Obligations the People, Nobles, Bishops, and Commons
consent to own them as their King, that the Archbishops conjure R. the First,
and K. John, not to take upon them the Crown, unless they uprightly intended to
perform these Oaths; that all of them at the beginning of their Reigns by
Oaths, or Promises oblige themselves to grant these Laws and Customs to the
People, and that if any scrupled so to do, the Nobles thought it their concern
to hinder his Coronation, till he had either made, or promised this engagement

They therefore thought it absolutely necessary, that whosoever would be their
King, should make this Compact with them, and be as much engaged by Oath to
grant these Privileges to them, as they were to swear Allegiance to him, and
commonly that this should be first done by their Kings before they would engage
to be their Subjects. And then it must be as necessary that he who does
continue to be their King should continue to perform his Oaths, and grant these
Privileges to his People.

SECT. III. That when the ancient Laws of their Country were wholly violated,
they constantly complained of the Injustice of the Action, required the
observation of them; and when they could not prevail by fair means, they sought
to recover their Right by Arms. Where an account is given of the Barons Wars
for the preserving of the Magna Charta, and the Charta de Forestis.
FOR farther evidence of this matter, let it be considered,

3dly, That when these Patriae Leges, these Ancicient Laws of their Country
were violated, they constantly complained of the Injustice of the Action,
required the observation of them; and when they could not prevail by fair
means, they revolted from their Subjection, and sought to recover their Right
by Arms. This they require of W. Rufus, when he was sick: And it was probably
for neglect of these good Laws, that most of the Nobility, says M. Paris, Page
10.
did una Rabie conspirare, conspire against him with one fury. For the same
reason was it, that when Robert came against King Henry the First, a great part
of the Navy went over to Robert, for this they did, says M. Paris, quia Rex
jam Tyrannizaverat, because the King was become a Tyrant, Page 40.
i. e. he governed not according to Law.

When Steven Archbishop of Canterbury in the year 1213, Per quam, si
volueritis, libertates diu amissas poteritis ad statum pristinum revocare. M.
Paris p. 167.
had found the Charter of Henry the First, by which he granted to them the Law
of King Edward, with those emendations which his Father, by the Counsel of the
Barons, did ratify, he told the Nobles this was the Charter, by which, if they
pleased, they might reduce their long lost Liberties into their former state;
The Charter being read, they much rejoiced, A rchiepiscopus vero promisit eis
fidelissimum auxilium suum pro posse suo, and sic confoederatione facta inter
eos, colloquium solutum est. M. Paris ibid.
and swore, in the presence of the Archbishop, that when they could spy out a
fit time, for those Liberties, if need required, they would spend their blood;
the Archbishop, on the other side, promised to help them to the uttermost of
his power, and so, having made a League among themselves, they dissolved the
Assembly.

When King John still neglected to observe these Laws, the Nobles come unto
him, requiring him to confirm the Liberties and Laws of King Edward, and other
Liberties granted to him, the Kingdom, Petierunt quasdam libertates, and leges
R. Edvardi, cum aliis libertatibus sibi, and Regno. Angliae, and Ecclesiae
Anglicanae concessis, confirmari. M. Paris p. 176.

Capitula libertatum and legum quae ibi magnates confirmari quaerebant partim
in Charta R. Henrici superius scripta sunt, partimque ex legibus R. Edvardi
antiquitus excerpta -- affirmantes quod, nisi Rex illas incontinenti
concederet, and sigilli munimine confirmaret, ipsi per captionem castrorum
suorum, terrarum, and possessionum, ipsum Regem compellerent, donec super
praemissis satisfaceret competenter. M. Paris p. 176.


and the Church of England, they being leges Antiquae, and Regni consuetudines;
the Ancient Laws and Customs of the Kingdom, contained partly in the Charter of
Henry the First, and partly gathered out of the old Laws of King Edward,
threatening that if he would not instantly grant them, and confirm them under
his Seal, they would compel him so to do, by seizing on his Castles, Lands, and
Possessions, till he gave them competent satisfaction in that matter. Then the
Archbishop showed the King the Contents of that Charter; Quod nunquam tales
libertates concederet unde ipse efficeretur servus, and quare cum istis iniquis
exactionibus Barons non postulant Regnum. ibid.
and upon the Kings answer, that he would never grant such Liberties by which
he himself was made a servant; and that the Barons might as well ask the
Kingdom, they betake themselves to War, and the Barons having got the City of
London on their side, they write Letters to all the Earls, Barons, and Knights
who adhered to the King, exhorting them, with threats, that as they loved the
Indemnity of all their Goods, Possessions, deserting the perjured King, they
would adhere to them faithfully, and stand immoveably with them, fighting for
the Liberties, Miserunt literas ad comites, Barons, and milites illos qui
adhuc per Angliam Regi, licet fide, adhaerere videbantur, exhortantes eos, cum
comminatione, ut, sicut omnium Rerum suarum and possessionum indemnitatem
diligebant, Regem perjurum deserentes, and sibi fideliter adhaerentes, simul
cum eis pro libertatibus, and pace Regni immobiles starent, and efficaciter
decertarent. M. Paris p. 177.
and stand immoveably with them, fighting for the Liberties, and Peace of the
Kingdom.

Whereupon the King, finding that he was not able to resist the strength of the
Barons, In ejus tempore fuerunt provisi Articuli M. Chartae ad communem
profectum Regni. p. 2424.
without difficulty grants the Laws and Liberties they demanded, and confirmed
them by his Charter. And thus it was, as Henry of Knyghton says, that in his
time were procured the Articles of Magna Charta to the common good of the
Realm. And when the King, by the instigation of some Sons of Belial, was again
persuaded to fly from his Oath and Promise, Quid faciemus de isto Rege iniquo,
si sic dimiserimus illum, delebit nos, and populum nostrum, expedit igitur ut
deleatur a solio Regni sui, nolumus enim de caetero eum regnare super nos.
Henr. de Knight. de Event. Angl. p. 2423.
the Barons spoke thus to another, What shall we do with this wicked King? if
we let him thus alone, he will destroy us, and our People; it is expedient
therefore, that he should be expelled from the Throne, we will not have him any
longer to Reign over us. And thereupon they send presently to Lewis the Son of
the French King to come to their assistance, promising him the City of London,
and their Allegiance to him. And though the Pope sent his Bull, by which he
made void this Charter of the Liberties of the Kingdom of England, and writ a
threatening Letter to the Barons of England upon that affair. Notwithstanding
all his threats, noluerunt desistere ab incaeptis, M. Paris p. 186.
the Barons would not desist from their Undertakings, but rising up still
against him, they vehemently annoyed him, saying; concerning the Pope, that of
the Prophet, Woe to him that justifies the wicked. And when the Pope proceeded
to Excommunicate the Barons by name, and in particular, neither would the
Barons observe, Page 192. Insurrexerunt in eum Magnates duplici necessitate
coacti, eo quod noluit permittere leges Sancti Edwardi teneri, sed omnia fecit
in suo velle, nec voluit legis formam obserware. Henr. de Knyghton p. 2418.
nor the Prelates publish the Excommunication. And what the judgment of the
generality of this Nation was of the whole War, we may learn not only from the
general engagement both of the Laity and Clergy in it, but also from our own
Historians; for they inform us, That our Nobles were forced to make this War
out of a double necessity, because he would not permit the Laws of St. Edward
to be kept, as formerly they were wont to be, but did all things by his own
will, nor would observe the form of the Law; but disinherited his Nobles
without the judgment of their Peers.

To this effect I find, according to the custom of those times, a long Rhyme in
the Chronicle of Mailros, deploring the infelicity of this Affair, That the
Body should attempt to rule the Head, and the People to be above their King;
but adding, that there was a great and manifold necessity that it should be so,
seeing the King perverted all the good Customs of the Kingdom, neither rightly
managing Laws, Rights, or Subjects, but making that to be Justice which was
agreeable to his own will, which moved them to swear they would not suffer this
Tyranny of the King, and to require the Deposition of him, if he would not
consent to the Reformation of the Law, and to resign the Homage they had made,
till he would give them caution to preserve the Peace. And the same Annals say,
the Barons only fought pro legibus pristinis restaurandis, for Restoration of
their ancient Laws. And when the Earl of Pembroke made his Oration to the
Assembled States in behalf of Henry the Third his Son, he begins it thus, Speed
p. 575.
Albeit the Father of this Prince, for his evil Demeaners, has worthily
undergone our Persecution -- we ought of Duty and Conscience, to obey his Son.

Ordinem praeposterum Anglia sancivit,
Mirum dictu dicitur, tale quis audivit?
Nam praesse capiti corpus concupivit;
Regem suum regere populus quaesivit:
Causa tamen multiplex illud exigebat,
Nam Rex mores optimos Regni pervertebat,
Jura, leges, subditos recte non regebat,
Quicquid erat placitum summum jus credebat,
Proprios Indigenas nimis deprimebat,
Barbaros Rutarios illis praeponebat,
Haeredes legitimos obsides perdebat,
Quorum Adventitius terras possidebat,
Regis ad colloquium Milites citati
Caute sibi praecavent, veniunt armati,
Jurant unanimiter jam se nolle pati,
Amplius Tyrannidem Regis tam ingrati.
Die primo veniunt juri parituri:
Rex venire distulit nolens stare juri,
Diem ponit alterum temporis futuri:
Nec venit, sed veniunt ipsi coacturi.
Regis ergo postulant depositionem,
Legis nisi faciat emendationem,
Plenam and exhibeat certam cautionem
Pacis ad perpetuam conservationem.
Humagium quod fecerant reconsignaverunt,
Et Barons Militum causam susceperunt;
Leges tandem pristinas Regni sitientes,
Sed in Regem mittere manus non volentes.
Vide Reliqua p. 188.
When Henry the Third made void the Charters of Liberties, and of the Forest,
pretending they were granted whilst he was in duress, and had not the power of
his Body, or of his Seal; the People presently begin to murmur, and the Barons
siding with Richard Earl of Cornwall, the Kings Brother, with threats request
him to do right to his Brother, sharply denouncing to him, that he should
without delay restore the Charters to him sealed which he had cancelled at
Oxford; In eodem Concilio fecit Rex cancellare, and cassare omnes Chartas in
provinciis omnibus Angliae de libertatibus Forestae, hanc occasionem
praetendens quod Chartae illae concessae fuerant, and libertates scriptae, and
signatae, dum ipse erat in custodia, nec sui corporis, aut sigilli aliquam
habuit potestatem. M. Paris p. 232.

Sin autem, ipsi illum gladiis discurrentibus compellerent ut sibi super his
satisfaceret competenter. M. Paris p. 233.


and if he did not, they would compel him by the Sword to make him competent
satisfaction in these matters.

A. D. 1233. the King invites over the Poictovins, and other Strangers, who,
with the Bishop of Winton oppress the Nobles with all their power, and cause
great discord and complaints; For judgments were committed, says M. Paris,
Judicia committuntur injustis, leges exlegibus, pax discordantibus, justitia
injuriosis. p. 263.
to the unjust, the Laws to them who were Outlawed, Peace to those who were
given to Discord, and Justice to the Injurious. These things so exasperate the
Nobility, that they Combine for Defense of the public; and by Richard his
Brother, and the Earl Marshal, humbly request of the King, that he would
speedily correct these excesses which tended to the subversion of his Crown and
Kingdom, Regem humiliter rogabat, ut tales excessus corrigere festinet, per
quos Coronae suae, and Regni subversio imminebat, affirmabat insuper quod si
hoc emendare diffugeret, ipse, and caeteri de Regno Magnates, tamdiu se ab
ipsius consilio subtraherent, quamdiu alienigenarum consortio frueretur. M.
Paris p. 264.
to the oppression of his natural People, and of their Laws and Liberties, and
that if he would not reform them, they would withdraw themselves from his
Counsel.

Whereunto the Bishop of Winchester replys, That it was lawful for the King to
call what strangers he listed about him for Defense of his Crown and Kingdom,
thereby to compel his proud and rebellious Subjects to their Obedience; with
which Answer they were so incensed, that they promised each other in this
cause, Firmiter promiserunt ad invicem quod pro hac causa, quae omnes tangebat,
usque ad divisionem corporis and animae viriliter decertarent. Matthew. Paris
ibid.
which concerned them all, they would spend their lives.

Then the King Summons them to a Parliament at Oxford, to which they would not
come, and after this to another at Westminster; they sending him this Message,
That he should suddenly remove Peter Bishop of Winton, and his Poictovins; and
that if he would not do this, they all, by the Common Counsel of the whole
Kingdom, would expel him with his evil Counselors out of the Kingdom, Sin
autem nollet, ipsi omnes de communi consilio totius Regni ipsum, cum iniquis
consiliariis suis, a Regno depellerent, and de novo Rege creando contrectarent.
M. Paris. p. 265.
and consult about the creation of a new King.

A. D. 1234. A Parliament is Assembled at Westminster, in which indeed the
Bishop of Chester Excommunicates all them who were designing alium Regem
creare, to create another King; M. Paris p. 271.
yet does the Archbishop Elect, and his Suffragans roundly declare against the
cruel and dangerous Practices of Peter Bishop of Winton, and Peter de Rivalis.
First, Because they suggested, Vocantes eos proditores, and facientes omnes sic
vocari -- qui melior est homo terrae vestrae. p. 271.
that the English were Traitors, and alienated the Kings heart from the
Marshal, who was the best Man in the Land. So that, in their judgment, they
that fought, and were then in Arms for their Laws and Liberties, were so far
from being Traitors, that they were the best Men of the Nation. Secondly, That
there was cause to fear the Ruin both of King and Kingdom, since they had got
such an Ascendent over him, Timendum est tam de vobis, quam de Regno, cum
videamini magis esse in eorum potestate, quam ipsi in vestra. Ibid.
that he seemed rather to be under their power, than they under his. Which also
seems to have been the case betwixt King James and his Jesuits. Thirdly, That
they confounded, and perverted the Law of the Land sworn to, and confirmed, and
strenghned by Excommunication, and with that all Justice; by reason of which,
and many other grievances, they humbly besought him to govern his People,
according to the example of other Nations, by the sworn Natives of his Kingdom,
declaring that if he did not correct these miscarriages in a little time, Item
legem terrae juratam, and confirmatam atque per excommunicationem roboratam,
pariter and justi^iam confundunt, and pervertunt. Ibid.

Nisi, infra breve tempus, ista correxeritis, in vos, and in omnes alios
contradictores, per censuram Ecclesiasticam procedemus. p. 272.


they would proceed by Ecclesiastical Censure both against his Counselors and
himself.

Edmund Archbishop Elect of Canterbury, being soon after consecrated, comes to
the King with his Bishops and Prelates, relates again the same grievances,
declaring to him, That if he would not correct, and pacifically compose these
things with his Liege People, he, with his Prelates, would denounce the
Sentence of Excommunication against him and all the Enemies of this Concord.
Upon which the King is, at last, prevailed with to remand the Bishop of Winton
to his Cure, Denuntiavit etiam ipsi express quod, nisi Clericus errorem
demitteret, and cum fidelibus Regni sui pacifice componeret, ipse -- cum
omnibus Praelatis qui aderant, in ipsum Regem sententiam ferret
excommunicationis, and in omnes alios hujus pacis contradictores. Ibid.
to banish Peter de Rivalis from the Court, and the Poictovins from the Kingdom.

One thing more is observable in this matter, that as the War of the Marshal
was generally thought just, so the Marshal justifies himself to have been no
Traitor, as being always ready to stand to the judgment of his Peers, and being
exiled, and deprived of his Offices and Lands against Law, for which cause,
says he, I ceased to be the Kings Liege Man, Unde homo suus non fui, sed ab
ipsius Homagio non per me, sed per seipsum licenter absolvebar. p. 273.
and was absolved from my Homage not by my self, but by the King.

A. D. 1237. A Parliament is held at London, in which the King requests, in
regard of the great expense for his Sisters Marriage, the thirtieth part of all
Movables both of the Clergy and the Laity. After great opposition made to this
demand, and the recital of many supposed miscarriages, the King disavowing, and
protesting against his former Revocation, and freely granting the inviolable
observation of the Liberties, under pain of Excommunication, has yielded to
him the thirtieth part of all movables. Spontanea promisit voluntate
libertates M. Chartae suis fidelibus Regni sui ex tunc inviolabiliter
observare, etc. Matthew. Paris p. 298.


In the year 1240. the Archbishops, Bishops, and many of the Nobles, assembled
at London, grievously complain of diverse Injuries, Oppressions, and Desolations
which befell the Church by the evil Counsel of the King, violating his
Charters, and his Oaths, after he had so often sworn that he would preserve the
Ecclesiastical Rights inviolated, Reponentes querimoniam gravissimam coram
Rege, in curia sua, super variis injuriis, and oppressionibus, and quotidianis
desolationibus illatis Ecclesiae per iniquum Regis consilium, contra Chartas
suas, and juramenta temere veniendo, -- cum ipse Rex toties juraverat se jura
Ecclesiastica illibata conservare, ipsomet audiente, and Candelam tenonte, quod
omnes Episcopi in violatores libertatum Ecclesiasticarum simul sententiam
fulminabant, in cujus sententiae consummatione, Rex, ut alii, suam Candelam
extinxit inclinando. M. Paris p. 354.
and himself held a Candle when the Bishops in his hearing pronounced the
Sentence of Excommunication against all the Violaters of the Ecclesiastical
Liberty, he then extinguishing his Candle with the rest.

In the year 1242. the King requests farther Supplies of his Parliament held at
Westminster for his intended expedition into France. Et praeterea concessit eis
tunc quod omnes libertates contentae in M. Charta ex tunc in antea before
tenerentur per totum Regnum suum, and inde fecit eis quandam parvam Chartam
quam adhuc habent, in qua eaedem continentur -- and quia dominus Rex nunquam
post tricesimam datam Chartam suam de libertatibus tenuit. Ibid. p. 394.
But they resolutely deny to give him any, for that, in order to the obtaining
former grants of Money, he had promised and granted to them that all the
Liberties contained in Magna Charta, should from thence be fully observed
through the Kingdom, and had given them a little Charter in which they were
contained; and yet, after all, he never was true to his word, but oppressed
them still more.

In the year 1244. he desires new Supplies, which for a time they refuse,
pleading that the Charter of Liberties which the King had granted, Et quia
Charta libertatum quas dominus Rex olim concesserat, and pro cujus
conservatione Archiepiscopus Cant Edmundus juraverat, and fide-jusicrat, and
certissime pro Rege promiserat, nondum existit observata. Matthew. Paris p. 432.
and the Archbishop had upan Oath in the King's name promised to them, was not
observed. Though at last, upon the King's faithful Promise to keep and observe
the Liberties unto which he had sworn at his Coronation, and whereof he had
granted his Charter, and upon the appointment of four Noble Men to be of the
King's Council, who should be conservatores libertatum, Keepers of their
Liberties, they grant him new Supplies; the King then promising himself to
observe them, and requesting that for the defense of their Liberties, all the
Bishops in their Diocesses should pronounce Sentence against him, and all who
violated the said Liberties in any Article of them. Rex tam in propria persona,
tum per internuntios solennes, promisit se libertates quas juraverat in
Coronatione sua, super quibus Chartam fecerat, integerrime servaturum, ad
quarum etiam tuitionem rogavit ut singuli Episcopi, in Dicecesibus suis
sententiam ferrent in ipsum, and omnes qui contra memoratas libertates venirent
in aliquo Articulo. M. Paris p. 435.
And thus they agreed to grant him a Supply.

In the year 1252. he holds a Parliament at London, and requires more Money;
and they, after some consultation answer, that though the King had much
oppressed both Church and Kingdom, they would do their utmost to satisfy his
desires, provided that, as he had often promised, he would now at last
inviolably observe the Charter of their Liberties, so often covenanted and
sworn to. Other things they demanded then, which the King would by no means
agree to, swearing horribly, that whilst he lived quantumcunque Ecclesiam
Anglicanam, and Regnum suum Angliae oppreserit; and afflixerit quod postulat a
nobis adhuc impendemus, and desiderio suo, pro posse, obsecundabimur, si,
quodmultoties promisit, vellt Chartam toties pactam, totiesque debitam,
Libertatum nobis juratarum inviolabiliter posthac observare. p. 568. Nunquam in
talem mergeretur Servitutem. Ibid. p. 570.
he never would be reduced into such slavery: And so the Assembly breaks up,
producing nothing but the King's Wrath.

In the Year 1253. was assembled a very great Parliament, in which the
Archbishop, and some Bishops, are sent to induce the King to permit H. Church
to enjoy her Liberties, as he had often promised upon Oath, and declaring, that
if he would correct this, and other of his miscarriages, according to the Tenor
of M. Charta, they would incline to his Petition, Quod si hunc, and alios
errores, secundum M. Chartae de Libertatibus confectae tenorem emendaret, ipsi,
usque ad gravamen magnum, Petitionibus suis inclinarent, etc. p. 579.
how burdensome soever it might be to them: This the King promises to do,
and desires them to assist him in it; so the Clergy grant him a Tenth, and the
Knights Scutage, viz, three Marks of every Knights Fee for that year, Rex bona
fide, and sine aliqua cavilatione, promisit, se Chartam Magnam, and omnes ejus
Articulos fideliter observaturum, quam Rex Johannes tenere juravit, and
similiter qui praesens est, in susceptione Coronae, and poste^ multoties. Ibid.
and the King promises faithfully, and without cavil to ratify Magna Charta,
and faithfully to observe all the Articles of it, which King John, and he, at
his Coronation, and often since, had sworn to observe. And this is done in the
most solemn and ceremonial manner that could be devised; for the King, with all
the great Nobility of England, all the Bishops and chief Prelates in their
Ornaments, with burning Candles in their hands, assemble to hear the terrible
sentence of Excommunication upon all the Infringers of the same; and at the
lighting of those Candles, the King, having one in his hand, gives it to one of
the Prelates, saying, It becomes not me, Nondecet meCandelam talem tenere, sum
non enim Sacerdos; Cor autemmajus perhibet Testimonium; and ex tunc tenuit
manum expansam ad Pectus, donec tota sententia finiretur. p. 580.
who am no Priest, to hold this Candle; my Heart shall be a greater testimony;
and withal laid his hand on his Breast the whole time the sentence was read,
which was thus pronounced: In the name of the Omnipotent God, etc. Which done,
he caused the Charter of King John his Father to be read: In the end, having
thrown away their Candles, they cried out, So let them who incurr this sentence
be extinct, and stink in Hell: And the King with a loud voice said, Dixit ipse
Rex, Sic me Deus adjuvet, haec ommia illibata observabo fideliter, sicut sum
homo, sicut sum Christianus, sicut sum miles, and sicut sum Rex Coronatus and
Inunctus, etc. M. Paris. p. 580. Idem Rex, consiliis malignorum praeventus,
easdem infringendo contra venire non formidavit, credens promunere absolvi a
trangressione. p. 597.
As God help me, I will, as a Man, a Christian, a Knight, a King Crowned and
Anointed, inviolably observe all these things. But notwithstanding all this,
in the very next year the King, by the counsels of some wicked men, is wrought
upon to infringe again this Charter, hoping for a gift to obtain an absolution
from his Oath.

In the next year a Parliament is called, which yields nothing but grievous
Complaints for breach of M. Charta, Page 608.
and Promises of supply provided it may be again confirmed, and the electing
the Justiciar, the Chancellor, and Treasurer put into their hands; to which the
King would not yield: But though the King would not observe it, M. Paris says,
It was cried in all Countries, Diebus autem istis acclamatum est in
comitatibus, and annunciatum est in Synodis, in Ecclesiis, and ubicunque
locorum homines convenerant, ut M. Charta inviolabiliter teneretur, quam R.
Johannes concesserat, and iste Rex praesens multoties concessit; and lata est
sententia solenniter in omnes ejusdem violatores. Ibid. p. 609.
and denounced in all Synods, Churches, and public resort, that M. Charta
should be inviolably observed, and the sentence of Excommunication is denounced
against all the violaters of it.

In the Year 1256. Provision is again made sub paena horribilis Anathematis,
Page 619.
under the penalty of an horrible Anathema, that the M. Charta of King John
should be observed.

In the Year 1257. The King requests an Aid for his Son Edmund, for the
acquiring the Kingdom of Sicily, and after many excuses, upon condition that
the King would observe M. Charta so often promised, and bought, they tender
52000. Marks, with which the King was not satisfied. Ee tamen condition
addita, ut M. Chartam, toties promissam, emptam, and redemptam, ex tunc
inviolabiliter observaret, etc. p. 637.


In the Year 1258. was held the Parliament at Oxford where the Nobles enter
into an unchangeable League to require that the King should faithfully observe
the Charter of King John, Parliamento incipiente, solidabatur Magnatum
propositum and consilium immutabile, exigendo constantissime ut Dominus Rex
Chartam Libertatum Angliae, quam Johannes Rex Anglis concessit -- fideliter
teneat, and conservet -- exigebant insuper sibi fieri Justiciarum, etc. -- Quod
Rex recognoscens, graviter juravit consiliis eorum obsecundare, and Edvardus
filius ejus eodem est juramento adstrictus. p. 653.

Rex coactus est corporale praestare Sacramentum, cum omnibus fere post
jurantibus illud idem. Hyp. Neustr. p. 467.


which he had so often swore to perform, they require also the chief Justiciar,
Chancellor, and Treasurer to be ordained by public choice, and the twenty four
Conservators of the Kingdom to be confirmed, twelve by the Election of the
Lords, and twelve by the King, who swears to the confirmation of these things,
and causes the Prince to take the same Oath. Walsingham adds, that all after
him did swear almost the same thing.

But notwithstanding this, the King gets an absolution from his Oath of the
Pope. Rogabant humiliter ut communiter praestitum juramentum inviolabiliter
observare vellet. Contin. M. par. p. 567.
Of this the Barons hearing, humbly beseech him to perform the Oath publicly
sworn; but the King answering them with threats, the business is deferred till
the coming of Prince Edward; who coming, sides with the Barons, according to
his Oath, and a League is made betwixt them to apprehend the King's Evil
Counselors, Ibid.
and their Abettors, and to endeavor to remove them from the King.

In the Year 1263. The contest betwixt the King, and the Barons is referred to
the mediation of the French King, who annuls the provisions of Oxford, but with
this exception, That the Ancient Charter of King John, Hoc excepto, quod
Antiquae Chartae R. Johannis Angliae Universitati concessae, per illam
sententiam in nullo intendebat penitus derogare. p. 668.
granted to the Community, should in nothing be thereby impaired.

Then began the Barons Wars under Simon of Monfort, who succeeded so far in
them, as to take the King and his Son Prisoners. But afterward the Prince
escaping out of Prison, fights with Simon, and overthrows him at Evesham, where
he was slain.

And here it is to be observed, that none of the Historians of those times will
permit this Simon to be called a Rebel, or a Traitor, but they still represent
him as a most devout servant of God and the Church, Sciendum, quod nemo sani
capitis debet censere, neque appellare Simonem nomine Proditoris; non enim fuit
Proditor, sed Dei Ecclesiae in Anglia devotissimus Cultor, and fidelissimus
Protector, Regni Anglorum Scutum and Defensor. Chron. de Mailr. p. 228.
and a most faithful Protector, Shield, and Defender of the Kingdom of
England, and even a Martyr for the Liberties of Church, and State.

After the end of these Wars, in the Year 1269. M. Par. Cont. p. 677.
the King calls a Parliament to be held at Marlborough, where the Statutes
called the Statutes of Marlborough were Enacted, Magna Charta in singulis suis
Articulis teneatur, tam in his quae ad Regem pertinent, quam quae ad alios:
Similiter Charta de Foresta.
in the Fifth Chapter of which it is decreed, That the Great Charter, and the
Charter de Foresta shall be observed in all their Articles, both concerning the
the King, and his Subjects. And here, Inst. l. 2. p. 102.
says the Lord Coke, it is to be observed, that after this Parliament neither
M. Charta, nor Charta de Foresta was ever attempted to be impugned, or
questioned, whereupon Peace and Tranquillity have ever since ensued.

Edward the First, in the twenty fifth year of his Reign, confirms the said
Charters of the Liberties of England, and of the Forest, and declares they are
to he holden for Common Law, Confirm. Chart. c. 1.
requires that they should be held in every point, that they should be sent
under the Great Seal, to all his Justices, as well of the Forest as others,
proclaimed by the Sheriff of the County; and that all Justices, Sheriffs,
Mayors, and other Ministers, which under the King had the Laws to guide them,
should allow the said Charters in all their points, which in any Plea shall
come before them in Judgment, and that the said Charters should be sent to all
the Cathedrals within the Realm: and should be read twice a year before the
People, Chap. 3.
and that the Arch Bishops, and Bishops, Chap. 4.
should denounce the Sentence of Excommunication against all them who, in Word,
or Deed, did act against the said Charters, and these Sentences shall be
pronounced, and published twice in the year by the said Prelates.

And because, in the sixth Chapter of the said Act, there was added this
clause, Saves les ancient aides and prises, dues and accustomes, which gave
some color for the King's Officers to make an Evasion, the Lords of
Parliament, met in the twenty eighth year of his Reign, do importune the King
again to confirm the said Charters, which he promised to do; but when it came
to be set down in form of an Act, the King would have added, A saving of the
Right of his Crown, which the Lords did mainly inveigh against, and pressed the
King with his promise to confirm them as absolutely as his Father Henry 3. had
done; which, in the end, he yielded to, as appears by the Act, called Articuli
super Chartas, Chap. 1.
where these Charters are again confirmed; and it is provided that they shall be
read four times every year before the People in every County after the Feast of
St. Michael, and after the Feast of the Nativity of our Savior, after Easter,
and after the Nativity of St. John the Baptist.

When the King had ended his Wars in Scotland, he refused to stand to the
confirmation which he had made to his Barons, of such Laws and Liberties as he
before had granted, pretending that they had forced his consent, Obtinuit Rex a
Domino Papa absolutionem a juramento, quod invitus praestiterat super
observantia Libertatum alias a Comitibus and Baronibus exactarum. Walsingh. p.
92.
and he obtained of the Pope an absolution from the Oath which he unwillingly
had taken to observe them. But when great murmuring, and discontent followed
hereupon, and for his levying Taxes without consent of Parliament, in his
thirty fourth year he makes the Statute de Tallagio non concedendo, for the
quieting of the Commons, and for a perpetual Law for ever after; declaring,
That no Aid or Taxes shall from thenceforth be levied without their consent,
and making a general restitution to the Subjects of all their Laws, Liberties,
and free Customs, as freely, and wholly, as at any time before in the better
and fuller manner they used to have the fame; and and so ended all the disputes
touching these Charters.

Walsingham says, Page 71, 72.
that the Grievances which the Archbishops, Bishops, Abbats, Priors, Earls,
and Barons, with the whole Commonalty, remonstrated to the King were these, viz.

First, That they were not dealt with according to the Laws and Customs of the
Land, according to which their Ancestors used to be governed.

Secondly, That the Articles of M. Charta were neglected, to the great damage
of the whole Community.

Thirdly, That the Assize, and Charter of the Forest was not observed; and then
he adds, that the Nobles would consent to no other form of Peace with the King,
than that which he established in the Statute, de Tallagio non concedendo, and
which I have now set down.

There is one thing more very observable in the Reign of that King, that when
the Pope had summoned him before him to answer touching his Right to the
Kingdom of Scotland, a Parliament then held at Lincoln, Papa R. Edvardum primum
in judicium vocante, respondet Parliamentum Lincolniae habitum, quod praefatus
Dominus noster Rex, super juribus Regni Scotiae, aut aliis suis temporalibus,
nullatenus respondeat judicialiter coram vobis, nec judicium subeat quoquomodo
-- cum praemissa caderent manifest in exhaeredationem juris
answer the Pope thus, That their King should not answer judicially before the
Pope, nor undergo his Judgment for his Rights of the Kingdom of Scotland, or
any other Temporal Rights, because this manifestly tended to the disinherison
of the said Crown, Coronae Regni Angliae, and R. Dignitatis, ac subversionem
Status ejusdem Regui notoriam, necnon in praejudicium Libertatis,
Consuetudinum, and Legum paternarum, ad quarum observationem, and defensionem,
ex debito praestiti juramenti, adstringimur, and quae manu tenebimus toto
posse, and totis viribus, cum Dei auxilio, defendemus; nec etiam permittimus,
aut aliqualiter permittemus, sicut nec possumus nec debemus, praemissa tam
insollta, indebita, praejudicialia, and alias inaudita, praelibatum Dominum.
Nostrum Regem, etiamsi vellet, facere, seu modo quolibet attemptare. Walsingh.
Hist. p. 85. Hypod. Neustr. p. 496. Speed p. 731.
and the R. Dignity, and the subversion of the said Kingdom, and of the
Liberties, Customs, and Paternal Laws, to the defense of which they were by
their Oath obliged, and with their whole power would defend; and were the King
never so willing, they, as they ought not, so they would not permit the King to
attempt the Premises. When King Richard the Second asked of Sir Robert
Trisilian, and his other Lawyers, whether he might not Disannul the Decrees of
the last Parliament, and they had answered that he might, BECAUSE HE WAS ABOVE
THE LAWS, as one of them confessed, he deserved death for that Answer, so all
them, that could be caught, soon after found it.

Farthermore, Let it be observed, that the Nobility of England, as the Lord
Coke observes, have ever had the Laws of England in great Estimation and
Reverence, Instit. l. 2. p. 97.
and would never suffer them to be changed. This made King Henry the First,
says he, to write to Pope Paschal thus: Let your Holiness know, that, by the
help of God, whilst I live, Notum habeat Sanctitas vestra, quod, me vivente,
auxiliante Deo, Dignitates and Usus Regni nostri Angliae non imminuentur; and
si ego, quod absit, in tanta dejectione me ponerem, Optimates mei, and totus
Angliae populus, id nullo modo pateretur. Charta Henr. primi.
the Dignities, and Customs of our Kingdom of England shall not be diminished;
and if I, which God forbid, should so far deject my self, my Nobles, and all
the people of England would never suffer them to be altered.

When the Bishops, in the twentieth year of Henry the Third, would have those
Children who were born before Matrimony Legitimate, as to Hereditary
Succession, as well as those who were born after Matrimony, all the Earls and
Barons answer with one voice, Et omnes Comites and Barons una voce
responderunt, quod nolunt Leges Angliae mutare quae hucsque usitatae and
approbatae sunt. Stat. Mert. c. 9. Bracton. l. 5. c. 19. F. 417.
We will not have the Laws of England, which have hitherto been used and
approved, to be changed.

In the Letters which all the Nobility of England, by Ascent of the whole
Commonalty, assembled in Parliament at Lincoln, wrote to Pope Boniface, we find
these words. Ad Observationem and Defensionem Libertatum, Consuetudinum, and
Legum paternarum, ex debito praestiti Sacramenti adstringimur, quae manu
tenebimus toto posse, totisque viribus, cum Dei auxilio defendemus, nec etiam
permittimus, nec aliquatenus permittemus, sicut nec possumus, nec debemus,
praemissa tam insolita, indebita, praejudicialia, and alias inaudita, Dominum
nostrum Regem, etiamsi vellet, facere, seu quomodolibet attemptare. Ret. Parl.
28. Ed. 1. apud Lincoln.
By virtue of our Oath we are bound to the Observation and Defense of the
Liberties, Customs, and Paternal Laws, which by the help of God we will defend
with our whole Power; non do we, nor will we permit our Lord the King, though
he were willing, to attempt things so unusual, undue, and prejudicial to the
Royal Dignity: and this was Sealed by 104 Earls, and Barons in the name of all
the Commonalty of England.

What they affirm touching their Oaths to defend their Laws, is an
unquestionable truth; for besides what has been noted of this kind already,
in the twenty fifth year of this King, it was established by Act of Parliament,
25. Ed. 1. c. 3. 42. Ed. 3. c. 1.
that if any Statute were made contrary to Magna Charta, or Charta de Forestis,
it should be holden for none; and the Nobles, and the great Officers were sworn
to the Observation of them: Yea, Speed p. 583.
by the Royal Command of Henry the Third, Oaths were taken to tie all men to
the strict Observation of them.

SECT. IV. That we find throughout the History of our Kings, that their
Election, or else their Compact with the People, has generally been conceived
a thing proper to strengthen their Title to the Crown, or at the least to
satisfy their People.
4ly, IT may be farther worthy of our consideration, that we find throughout
the History of our Kings that their Election, or else their Compact with the
people, has generally been looked on, as a thing proper to strengthen their
Title to the Crown, or at the least to satisfy the People. For instance,

First, Dunelm. p. 195. Hoved. E. 258. Ab omnibus tam Normannorum, quam
Anglorum Proceribus Rex est electus. Gemit. de Ducibus Norm. l. 6. c. 37.
Walsing. Hypod. Neust. p. 436.
Of the Conqueror S. Dunelmensis, and Hoveden inform us, that Foedus pepigit,
he made a Covenant with the people: Gulielmus Gemiticensis, and Walsingham,
say, that he was chosen King by all the Nobles of England and Normandy.

Secondly, Daniel p. 52. Polyd. Virg. Hist. l. 10. p. 164.
William the Second held the possession of the Crown of England by the Will of
the Kingdom, the Succession in Right of Primogeniture being none of his.
Volentibus omnium provincialium animis in Regem acceptus. M. Par. p. 10. Chron.
Joh. Brompt. p. 983, 984.
The Historians say, that the Nobles met in Council at Westminster, and after
long Consultation made him King; that by the willing minds of all he was
accepted for their King, and the King himself declares, quod ipsum in Regem
creaverant, that they had created him King.

Thirdly, Henry the First was invested in the Crown by the Act of the Kingdom.
The Historians tell us that a Council of the whole Community rejected Robert,
Unanimi ascensu suo ipsum refutaverunt, and pro Rege omnino recusaverunt, and
Henricum fratrem in Regem ere erunt. Knight. de Event. Angl. p. 2374. In Regem
electus est frater ejus Henricus, and consecratus est Rex Angl. M. Westminster. Hist.
p. 235. In Regem electus est, aliquantis tamen controversiis inter Proceres
excitatis, and Sopitis. W. Malmsb. l. 5. F. 88. J. Brompt. Chron. p. 997.
Walsing. Hypod. Neust. p. 446. Rich. Hagulst. p. 310.
the eldest Son of the Conqueror, and would not have him for their King; but
with unanimous consent, they advanced his Brother Henry to the Kingdom, who was
by all Elected, and Consecrated King at Westminster, after the death of William
Rufus, as being the first born of the Conqueror, after he was King of England.
William of Malmsbury says, he was Consecrated within four days after his
Brother's death, lest the Rumor of Robert's coming to England, should move the
Nobles to repent of their Election: Sciatis me Dei misericordia, and communi
consilio Baronum Regni Angliae, ejusdem Regni Regem esse coronatum. M. Paris,
page 38.
And in his Charters, the King himself writes thus; Know you that I was Crowned
King of England by the Common Council of the Barons of the Kingdom: And it is
observable, that his Elder Brother Robert being absent at the Holy Wars, they
chose Henry King, because they were afraid to be long without Government.

Fourthly, Florence of Worcester, William of Malmsbury, R. Hoveden, and R.
Hagulstadensis, do expressly say, that Stephen was chosen King by the Primates
of the Kingdom, A Primoribus Regni, cum favore Cleri and Populi, electus. R.
Hagulst. p. 312. Flor. Wigorn. p. 665. Hoved. F. 215. Malm sb. F. 101. B.
with the favor of the Clergy, and Laity; and that he took upon him the
Kingdom with their General consent; A scensu Populi and Cleri in Regem electus.
Malmsb Hist. Nov. l. 1. F. 101. B. R. Hagulst. p. 314.
and his own Charters say the same thing, as they had reason to do, he having
no Title at all, but as one of the Blood, by mere Election advanced to the
Crown. Daniel, p. 69.


Fifthly, Radulphus de Diceto, Ab omnibus electus, p. 529.
Says of Henry the Second, That he was Elected by all, and anointed by
Theobald, Archbishop of Canterbury.

Sixthly, And of Richard the First he says, Post tum Cleri and Populi Solennem
and debitam Electionem. p. 647.
That being to be promoted to be King by right of Succession, after the solemn
and due Election, both of the Clergy, and Laity, he took a Threefold Oath.
Hoveden adds, that he was Consecrated, and Crowned King of England, F. 374.
consilio and assensu, by the Council and assent of the Archbishops, Bishops,
Counts, and Barons.

Seventhly, P. 127. Archiepiscopus dixit, quod nullus praevia ratione alij
succedere habet Regnum, nisi ab universitate Regni unanimiter, Spiritus Sancti
invocata gratia, electus, and secundum morum eminentiam praeelectus, omnes hoc
acceptabant, ipsumque Comitem in Regem eligentes, and assumentes, exclamant,
dicentes, Vivat Rex. Matthew. Paris, p. 138.
King John received the Crown by way of Election; as being chosen by the
States, says Daniel. Matthew Paris says, That all consented to the Speech of
the Archbishop, that none ought to Succeed another in the Kingdom, unless he
were elected by the Community, and thereupon they elected the Count, and took
him for their King.

Eighthly, In Regem eligitur. p. 474.
The History of Croyland says, That after the death of King John, Henry, his
first born, was elected King.

Ninthly, Non tam jure haereditario quam unanimi assensu Procerum, and
Magnatum. Edward Franc. An. 1602. p. 95.
The Succession of Edward the Second, says Walsingam, Was not so much by right
of Inheritance, as by the unanimous consent of the Peers, and great Men.

Tenthly, Edward the Third was elected with the Universal consent of the People
upon his Father's Resignation: Walsing. Hist. Angl. p. 126. Hypod. Neust. p.
508.509. H. de Knyghton, p. 2550.
The Parliament then met at London, declared by common consent, That Edward the
Second was unworthy of the Crown, and for many Causes to be deposed, and that
his first born Son Edward should unanimously be chosen King; then the Election
is publicly declared in Westminster Hall, some of both Houses are sent to
Edward the Second, qui nunciarent Electionem filij sui, who should acquaint him
with the Election of his Son, and require him to resign the Crown; Electioni
consensit populus universus, all the people consented to the Election; so did
all the Prelates, and the Archbishop, who made an Oration on those words, Vox
populi vox Dei, and exhorted all to pray for the King Elect.

Eleventhly, Richard the Second succeeded Edward by right of Succession, H. de
Knight. p. 2630.
ac etiam voto communi singulorum, and by the Common suffrage of all.

Twelfthly, Henry the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth were only Kings by Act of
Parliament.

Thirteenthly, Edward the Fourth, at his entrance on the Government, makes a
solemn Declaration of his Right to the Crown of England, challenging it to
belong unto him by a double Right, the first as Son and Heir to Richard Duke of
York, Trussel. 179.
the Rightful Heir of the same; the second as elected by the Authority of the
Parliament, upon King Henry's forfeit of it.

Fourteenthly, The Parliament Roll published in Speed's Chronicle often says,
p. 913, 914.
That they had chosen Richard the Third for their King, and that the Crown
belonged to him as well by Election as Succession.

Fifthteenthly, And Henry the Seventh, Bacon. Hist. of Hen. VII. p. 12.
to all his other Titles by Marriage, Conquest, and from the House of
Lancaster, adds that of the Authority of Parliament.

SECT. V. That we find mention in History of diverse Acts of Parliament, or of
the Nobles of the Kingdom, continuing the Name and Honor of a King to him,
who, by their own confession, had not the immediate Title to the Kingdom, and
only Proclaiming him, who had the Right by Proximity of Blood, Heir Apparent to
the Crown.
5ly, MOreover we read of diverse Acts of Parliament, or of the Nobles of the
Kingdom, continuing the Name and Honor of a King to him, who, by their own
Confession, had not the just Title, and only Proclaiming him, who had the Right
by proximity of Blood, Heir apparent to the Crown: For instance.

The Contest betwixt Robert the Eldest Son of the Conqueror, Ad haec etiam
inter se constituerunt, ut si comes absque filio legali in Matrimonio genito
moreretur, haeres ejus esset Rex; modoque per omnia simili, si Regi contigisset
mori, haeres illius fieret Comes, hanc conventionem. 12 ex part Regis, and 12
ex part Comitis Barons Juramento firmaverunt. Flor Wigorn. p. 644.
and William Rufus his younger Brother, ended thus, That f Robert dyed without
a Lawful Son, King William should be his Heir, and if King William dyed
without issue, Robert should be his Heir; and this was Sworn to by twelve
Barons of each side.

In the contest betwixt the same Robert, and his younger Brother Henry,
Principes, M. Paris, p. 40. Hen. Hunting. F. 216. B. Joh. Bromp. p. 998.
the Princes, say some of our Historians, the wise men of our Kingdom, say
others, Sapientiores utriusque partis, Dunelm. p. 226. Flor. Wigorn. p. 650. R.
Hoveden, F. 268. B. Daniel p. 61.
made a Mutual, and general League of Concord, by their Pious, and Wise
Council; That Henry the First, Amiciutriusque foedus inter eos statuerunt sic,
quod Rex propter manifestum jus quod habuit ad Regnum possidendum, Roberto
singulis Annis tria millia Marcarum Argenti daret ab Anglia, and quis eorum
diutius viveret, Haeres esset alterius, si absque filio moreretur. M. Westminster. p.
236. Henr. Huntingd. Hist. l. 7. F. 216. B. M. Par. p. 40.
being invested with the Crown by Act of the Kingdom, should enjoy the same
during life, and that by reason of the manifest Right which Robert had to the
Kingdom; Henry should pay him 3000 Marks yearly, and that the longest liver
should be Heir to the other, if he died without a Son; by which Acts, if
William Rufus, or Henry had Sons, they were to Reign, though the manifest Right
was in Robert, and his Heirs.

And here it is observable, Maxima pars Nobiliorum Normannorum favebat Roberto,
cupiens hunc sibi asciscere in Regem, fratremque aut fratri tradere vivum, aut
Regno privare peremptum; hujus execrandae rei principes extitere Odo, etc. hoc
execrabile factum clam tractaverunt in quadragesima. Florent p. 642. Dunelm. A.
D. 1088. Hoved. par. 1. F. 264, Radulph. de Diceto p. 489. Proditores vocat H.
Huntingd. Hist. l. 7. F. 213. Perfides, W. Malmsb. Hist. l. 4. F. 68.
Conjurationis and perfidiae Socios. Florent. p. 643. Perjurij Reos, Matthew.
Paris, p. 10.
that though the greatest part of the Nobles did upon some dislike to Rufus, to
whom they had sworn Allegiance, favor his Brother Robert, desiring to advance
him to the Kingdom, and to destroy William, or deliver him alive to his
Brother; yet do all our Historians declare, that they who sided with William,
were faithful to their Earthly Lord, and the other party were Traitorous,
Perfidious and Perjured Persons, and that the thing it self was an excrable
fact.

And in like manner they who stood for Henry against the same Robert, L. 5. de
Henr. primo. F. 88.
who had manifest right, are said by W. of Malmsbury, justas parts fovere, to
be of the right side, and they who fought against him, to be fidei Regi juratoe
transfugoe, violaters of their Oath, and yet this Henry was advanced to the
Throne, not because he had Right during the life of his Elder Brother; but
because Robert being gone to the Wars at Jerusalem, Quia ignorabant quid actum
esset de Roberto fratre primogenito, and timuerunt diu sine Regimine vacillare.
Matthew. Paris p. 38.
they knew not what was become of him, and were afraid to be long without
Government.

But to proceed to other instances of this Nature from History. In the contest
between King Stephen, and Henry Duke of Normandy, the Son of the Empress Maud,
and the Right Heir of the Crown, Theobald Archbishop of Canterbury, and Henry.
Bishop of Winton, Rich. Hagulst. p. 330. H. Huntind. l. 8. F. 228. Joh. Brompt.
Chron. p. 1037. Gervas. Chron. p. 1375. Chron. de Mailros. p. 167.
made peace betwixt them upon these conditions; That King Stephen from that
time, should entirely enjoy the Kingdom, as lawful Prince, with the Glory and
Honor of it, and Henry should succeed him in the Kingdom as lawful Heir. This
peace was thus made, by the Counsel of the Wise Men, and the intervention of
the Nobles, and Friends of both parties, and was declared to be honest and
profitable, R. Stephanus Ducem Hen. cognovit in conventu Episcoporum, and
aliorum. Regni Optimatum, quod jus Hereditarium in Regnum Angliae habebat, and
Dux benign concessit, ut R. Stephanus tota vita sua, si velle, Regnum pacifice
possideret M. Paris p. 61, M. Westminster. p. 246.
and says M. Paris, it was concluded in a public Convention of the Bishops,
and Nobles of the Kingdom.

Fourthly, Thus was it also in the Case of Richard Duke of York, and Henry the
Sixth, for though Richard was the Right Heir to the Kingdom; Quod Dux and filij
sui, Edvardus Comes Marchiae, and Edmundus Comes Rutlandiae, qui ambo
discretionis annos attigerant, jurarent ipsi Regi fidelitatem, quodque ipsum
recognoscerent eorum Regem quamdiu ageret in humanis, id enim Parliamentum
ipsum decreverat, addendo, de ipsius Regis consensu, quod quamprimum Rex ipse
in fata decesserit, licebit dicto Duci suisque Haeredibus coronam Angliae
vendicare, and possidere. Hist. Coryl. Ed. Oxon. p. 550.
yet the Parliament, held A. D. 1460. decreed that Henry the Sixth should
reign, and be King during his Life, and that the remainder should rest in
Richard Duke of York, and the lawful Heirs of his Body, in general tail.

SECT. VI. The Inferences from the Resolutions of the best Casuists, to prove
that the Oath of Allegiance, and of the Coronation, are reciprocal; and
consequently that the obligation of the Oath of Allegiance does cease, when the
Original Compact is Fundamentally violated.
NOw the Inferences which naturally flow from this Historical Account of the
Kings of England, and their Government, are these:

First, That the Kings of England were Kings by virtue of an Original Compact,
made between them and the People: this is apparent by the Contract made by the
Conqueror with the Barons, and the Nobility, and Commonalty of England; and
the so frequent repetition of that, or a like Contract by the following Princes
of this Realm, by the Oaths they took at their Coronation, to preserve to the
People their Ancient Rights, and Liberties, their Original Customs and Laws;
and by the continual claim the people made to the Laws of their Country, the
Laws of King Edward, and the Magna Charta as their Right.

Accordingly the Lord Chancellor Fortescue, Chap. 9.13.
having declared that our Kings are Political Kings, who received their Power
from the People; he adds, That, Chap. 14. p. 34.
non alio pacto, by no other Contract did ever any Nation willingly incorporate
it self into a Kingdom; but that they by that means might more safely than
before enjoy Themselves, and their Goods, of which intent that Nation would be
defrauded; if having thus submitted to the Government of a King, he might spoil
them of their Goods, which before it was not Lawful for any man to do.

Secondly, That this Compact was, That the King should govern them according to
the Tenor of such Ancient Laws, and Original Customs as were received among
them, according to the Good, Approved, and Ancient Laws of the Kingdom, says
M. Paris, the Liberties in which the Nobles confided, says M. of Westminster;
the Laws of their Country, says W. of Malmsbury; the Laws of King Edward, say
the forementioned Authors; the Proper Laws, and Ancient Customs in which their
Fathers lived, say Hoveden, Stat. Merton. c. 9.25. H. 8. c. 21.
and the Chronicle of Lichfield; the Laws of England, the Ancient Laws of this
Realm originally established, say our Statutes; the Laws of the Land, the good
Laws of the Land, says the Oath of Richard the Second; the Charters of the
Liberties of England, the Common Liberty, say the contenders for them with King
John and Henry the Third; the fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, says King
James: Let it be observed,

First, Out of Fortescue, That our Kings rule not by Royal only, Chapter 9. p. 25,
26. Chapter 13. p. 32.
that is, Absolute, but by Political Power; and that therefore a King of
England cannot change the Laws of the Body, nor invade their Properties, but as
they do consent, Chapter 13. p. 32. c. 14. p. 34.
that he is advanced to the Throne for the safety of the Law, and his Subjects
in their Goods, and Bodies, and derives even this Power from the People; and
therefore cannot Lawfully Rule over them otherwise.

Secondly, That this is the difference betwixt a King Governing Absolutely, and
by Political Power, that the first can change the Laws of his Kingdom, F. 25.
B. 26. A.
impose Taxes, and other burdens without consent of his Subjects; whereas a
King who Rules Politically over his People can neither change the Laws, without
consent of his Subjects, nor charge them with strange impositions against their
Wills; That a King ruling only by Power Royal may easily become a Tyrant, but
whilst the Kingly Power is restrained by the Political Law, F. 26. B.
he cannot govern his People Tyrannically: That the Contract made with a King
governing Absolutely, F. 35. A.
is, that his Will shall be the Law; whereas a Political King cannot govern his
People by any other Power than that of the Laws.

And from these Principles it clearly follows, That a King Ruling Arbitrarily,
and Fundamentally, overturning the Laws, is no such King as our Constitution
knows, or ever did admit of; That therefore no Obedience, or Allegiance can be
due to him by Law, nor be intended in any Legal Oath, unless we can suppose men
at the same time intended to preserve their Constitution, and yet designed to
engage themselves, and others to be assistant to subvert it.

Thirdly, Let us consider the Rules laid down by the exactest Casuists,
touching the Cases in which the obligation of an Oath cease, and apply them
to the present Case. Thus then they say:

First, That when the Matter of an Oath cease, the Obligation of it cease
also, and that the Matter of it must then be judged to cease, Tunc enim
cessasse materiam censendum est, cum rerum status inter tempus jurandi, and
tempus adimplendi, ita immutatus est, ut si quo tempore jurabatur, praevideri
potuisset is qui postea insecutus est rerum status, non omnino juratum fuisset.
San. de Juramento Prael. 7. 7.
when the state of things betwixt the time of Swearing, and of fulfilling the
Oath, is so changed, that if it could have been foreseen by him who took the
Oath, at the time of his Swearing, he would not have taken the Oath. When the
Root of the Obligation is taken away, Quia Radice obligation is sublata,
tollitur una pullulans inde obligatio; fuit autem materia, quae causam dedit
jurationi, Radix ejus obligationis, quae ex illa juratione insecuta est. Ibid.
the Obligation thence arising must be taken away with it; now that which gave
the ground for taking the Oath, is the Root of the Obligation, which followed
upon the Oath.

Among the conditions which are de jure communi to be understood in all Oaths,
though they be not expressed; this, says the Reverend Bishop Sanderson,
Subingtelligendum quarto, rebus scstantibus, i. e. si res in eodem statu
permanserint quo nunc sunt, unde qui juravit reddere gladium, non tenetur
reddere furioso, and qui juravit ducere aliquam uxorem, non tenetur ducere, si
deprehendat eam esse ex alio viro gravidam: has, and istiusmodi conditiones in
omni juramento subintelligi fas est, etsi non exprimantur; and rigidus nimis
esset juramenti Interpres qui istarum aliquam exclusum iret. Prael. 2.. 10.
and many of the Schoolmen, is one, viz. That things continue, and remain in
the same state they were at the time of swearing; whence he that swore to
restore a Sword, is not bound to do it to a madman; and he that swore to marry
such a Woman, is not bound to do it, if he finds her afterward with Child by
another: these, and such like conditions, though they be not expressed, are to
be understood in all Oaths; and he that should exclude any of them, would too
rigidly interpret his Oath.

Secondly, Amesius adds, In Juramento subintelligi debent conditiones illae,
quae ex more and consuetudine recepra concipi praesumuntur ab iis ad quos
juramentum spectar. De Cas. Consc. l. 4. c. 22.
that in an Oath all those conditions are to be understood, which by the
received Customs and Manners of a Nation, are presumed to be conceived as
conditions belonging to it.

And that when the formal reason of an Oath is taken away, the Oath cease,
Quum aufertur ratio formalis juramenti, juramentum cessat ratione eventus, qui
casus est eorum qui jurarunt se obedituros domino aut principi alicui qui
postea cessat esse talis. Ibid. 36. Nec tenebitur, si cesset qualitas sub qua
alicui juravit, ut si Magistratus desinat esse Magistratus. Crot. de Jure Bell,
and Pac. l. 2. c. 13.. 18.
and that this is the Case of them who swear to a Prince, or to a Master, who
after cease so to be.

Thirdly, The Casuists farther tells us, that a promissory Oath, made purely on
such a Motive, and Foundation, supposes the continuance of that Foundation, as
the condition of its Obligation; and therefore cease to oblige, when he to
whom, and for whose sake it was made, tollit fundamentum illud quo nitebatur,
removes the Motive and Foundation of it. Saunders. de juramento praelect. 4. p.
99. Tombs lect. 18. p. 23.
For instance, Chremes the Master swears he will give to Sosia ten Crowns per
annum, and Sosia the Servant swears to serve him eight years, if Sosia will not
serve him the third year, Cremes is not obliged to pay him ten Crowns at the
years end; or if Cremes will not pay Sosia at the years end, Sosia is not bound
to serve him eight years; because this payment was the Sole foundation of Sosia
's service, this service the Sole motive of Chremes 's Oath.

Fourthly, They add, That without which it cannot in equity, and reason be
supposed that any reasonable man would, or any honest man should take an Oath,
must be supposed as a tacit condition in the taking of it; so that no person is
to be supposed to swear to do any thing, but with this proviso, as far as it
is consistent with equity and justice: Thus though Solomon promised to his
Mother not to say nay to her request, yet when she asked Abishag the Shunamite,
to be given to Wife to Adonijah, because the Marriage would have been
incestuous, or would have given him a pretense for disturbing of the Kingdom,
Solomon breaks his promise, and thereby shows that it was made with this
proviso; if I may safely and equitably do it. Hence they inser that the Laws of
Nature, and Self-Preservation must give tacit limitations to our promissory
Oaths, where they are general, and not expressive of Life and Death; because we
have an Obligation to them antecedent to all Oaths; nor can it rationally be
supposed that a man would promise to ruin and destroy himself, where the
public good did not make it necessary so to do.

If then the Kings of England be Kings by virtue of a Compact, originally made
betwixt them, and the people; if the Tenor of that Compact be on the King's
part, that he would govern them according to the Tenor of their Ancient Laws,
Liberties, Charters, and Customs; or as the Coronation Oath now runs, that he
will confirm to the people of England the Laws and Customs to them granted by
the Kings of England; that he will grant to hold, and keep the Laws, and
rightful Customs which the Commonalty of his Kingdom have, and to defend, and
uphold them as much as in him lies; that he will preserve, and maintain to the
Bishops, and the Churches committed to their Charge all Canonical Privileges,
and due Law and Justice, and will be their Protector and Defender to his Power,
and this Oath, and Compact be on the part of the Subject the very ground for
his entering into a Promise, and Oath of Allegiance, the very formal Reason of
it, the Motive, and Foundation upon which it is built: When any King of England
afterward makes void his Oath by an entire virtual dissolution of those Laws he
had by Oath engaged himself to keep and confirm, and plainly sets himself to
destroy that Church he swore to protect and defend, and to deny them all due
Law and Justice; he seems by just consequence to have made void the Motive,
and Foundation of that Allegiance they swore to him.

Grotius informs us, that the promise of a King to his Subjects gives them a
right to the thing promised, that being the Nature of all Promises and
Contracts: And this it does more certainly when it is only a promise of what
was originally their Right confirmed by his Oath, Dicimus ergo ex promiso and
contractu Regis, quem cum subditis iniit, nasci veram and propriam obligationem
quae jus dat ipsis subditis, ea enim est and promissorum, and contractuum
natura. De jure Bell. and pacis, l. 2. c. 14.. 8.
and the very condition upon which they accepted of him or his Progenitors as
their Kings, for as he rationally adds, if a People make a King by such Laws,
Plane si populus Regem fecerit non pleno jure, sed additis legibus, poterunt
per eas leges contrarij actus irriti fieri aut omnino, aut ex part, quia
eatenus populus jus sibi servavit. Ibid.. 2.
they make void what he does contrary to Law, because as to such things they
have reserved the Right unto themselves, or at the least they have limited his
Right; but to what end is all this, if by their Oath of Allegiance afterward
they virtually disannull that Right they had reserved to themselves, take off
all limitations of the King's Right, and put it in his power to break all his
promises without control, by binding themselves to the same Allegiance to him
when he does so, as when he rules them by Law, and observes his promises and
contracts? If therefore that must be supposed as a tacit condition of an Oath
without which it cannot in equity and reason be supposed that any reasonable
man would, or any honest man should take an Oath; if it cannot rationally be
supposed that any rational body would promise, or swear to ruin and destroy
themselves, their lives and fortunes, it cannot be supposed that they would
consent to such an Oath of Allegiance, as does entirely oblige them to suffer
themselves and their Constitution to be ruined; and to be assistant to it, and
therefore the tacit condition of that Oath must be, provided that the Commands
of their Superior be according to Law, and he does govern them by Law.

Again, if according to Fortescue our Kings Rule not by Absolute, but by
Political Power, and therefore cannot change their Laws, or invade the
properties of the Subject but by their consent; if he be advanced to the Throne
for the safety of his Subjects in their goods and bodies; if this be the
difference betwixt an absolute, and a political King, or King of England, that
the Will of the first is his Law, but the Law is the Rule of the Will of the
Second; the first can change the Laws of his Kingdom without the peoples
consent, the second cannot; the first may easily be a Tyrant, the second cannot
govern his people Tyrannically; and if from hence it follows, that a King
ruling Arbitrarily, and Fundamentally overturning the Laws, is no such King as
our Constitution owns, or ever did admit of; and therefore that no Allegiance
can be due to him by Law whom the Law knows not, nor ever did suppose, but
rather always did exclude: Then he who, being a Political King, makes himself
absolute, requiring in one of his Kingdoms to be obeyed without reserve, in
another setting up Governors and Viceroys disabled by Law to be so, in a third
part of his Dominions virtually dissolving all the Laws against Popery, by
admitting a Pope's Nuncio, dispensing with the Laws, forbidding them the
exercise of their Religion, and the taking upon them Offices Civil and
Military, and by just consequence, all the Laws of the Kingdom, by claiming an
unlimitted Power of Dispensing with them: He who was entered into a League with
a Potent Monarch, to set up Popery and Arbitrary Power in England; he who was
bound by the Principles of his Religion to destroy the Church of England, and
to give up Protestants to suffer the punishment decreed against Heretics by
the Romish Church, and had begun to dissolve her Colleges, and silence her
Bishops by an Illegal Arbitrary Commission, and was so wholly given up to the
will of the Jesuits, that nothing else could be expected from him he certainly
must be none of the Kings to which we swore Allegiance; and by refusing to be a
political King, the only King our Laws will own, he must have absolved his
Subjects from that Allegiance which is due only to such a King: If Rebus sic
stantibus be, as the Reverend Bishop Sanderson says, a condition of all Oaths;
if the matter of the Oath must be then judged to cease when things so change,
that if the change could have been foreseen, the Oath would not have been
taken; then much more must the Obligation of it cease, when so great a change
is made as from a political to an absolute King, from a King ruling by Law, and
protecting, the Church to a King ruling against Law, and subverting the Church
against both his Oath, and Law.

The same learned Bishop says, That if a Soldier swears obedience to a
General, or Commander of an Army, when he cease to be General, his Oath
cease to oblige; Si quis ergo miles juret Obsequium belli Imperatori, finito
demum bello, cum ipse desierit effe Imperator, non ultra tenetur ex juramento
Obsequium ei praestare; and si Pater aliquis juraret se Testamentum in quo
filium instituisset Haeredem nunquam mutaturum comperto tamen postea filium
Haeredem institutum Patri venenum miscuisse, Pater non ultra tenetur juramento.
Prael. 7.. 7.
and if a Father swear never to change his Will in which he has made such a
Son his Heir, he is absolved from that Oath, if his Son afterward endeavor to
poison him, that an Oath to deliver a Sword binds not to deliver it to a mad
man, who may destroy himself or me with it: And an Oath to marry a Woman binds
not to do it, if she prove with Child by another; why therefore should an Oath
of Allegiance made to a politic King, ruling by Law, bind us to pay that
Allegiance to a King thus ruling Arbitrarily; he ceasing as much to be that
King we swore to, as a General plainly going about to destroy his Army cease
to be their General, and being as much different from his former self, as a
Woman pregnant from a Virgin; and as like to be pernicious to the Government,
as a Son attempting to poison his Father would be to him, or a Madman to them
who should give him a Sword; and all this seems plainly to be contained in
those excellent words of King James, Fourth Speech at Witehall A D. 1609. p.
530, 531.
that the King was lex loquens, after a sort, binding himself by a double Oath
to the Observation of the Fundamental Laws of his Kingdom, tacitly AS BY BEING
A KING, and so bound to protect as well the People, as the Laws of his Kingdom,
and expressly by his Oath at his Coronation, so as every just King in a settled
Kingdom IS BOUND TO OBSERVE THAT PACTION MADE TO HIS PEOPLE BY HIS LAWS, in
framing his Government agreeably thereunto; and therefore a King Governing in a
settled Kingdom LEAVES TO BE KING, AND DEGENERATES INTO A TYRANT, as soon as he
leaves off to rule according to his Laws: -- Therefore all Kings that are not
Tyrants, or purjured, will be glad to bound themselves within the Limits of
their Laws, and they that persuade them to the contrary are VIPERS and PESTS,
both against them, and the Commonwealth. Where it is granted,

1. That there be Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom. And

2ly. That our Kings, even by being Kings, do tacitly bind themselves to
protect the People, and the Laws of their Kingdoms.

3ly. That the King makes a Paction with his People by his Laws, which Paction
he is bound to observe. And,

4ly. That as soon as he leaves off to rule according to his Laws, HE LAVES TO
BE A KING, and then certainly we must leave to be of right his Subjects, or to
owe him Allegience. And though, even in this case I cannot yet approve of
Subjects taking up Offensive Arms against a King on this account, because I
know not what power of Avenging themselves they have, or how the Sword is put
into their hands to do it, nor who has made them Judges in their own cause,
yet if Providence is pleased to send a (...), another Prince to free us from a
King who has thus violated his Compact, and not only thus leaves to be King,
but does it also by deserting us, and so far abdicating the Government, which
is our present case; then I am apt to think we may honestly accept of this
deliverance as being formerly absolved de jure from our Allegiance to such a
King.

And lastly, let it be Observed that all our Kings if they were capable, were
Crowned soon after their coming to the Throne, or the decease of their
Predecessors, the Ceremony till of late being only omitted in the case of Henry
the Sixth, a Child of nine months old; that at their Coronation they generally
took their Oaths to preserve their Peoples Rights and Liberties, and govern
them by their Old and good Laws and Customs; and that they received Homage of
their Subjects at the same time. That the usual custom was, and still is,
first, That they take their Coronation Oath, and then the Archbishop ask the
People whether they be willing to subject themselves, and pay their due
Allegiance to a King so sworn; That if any of them at their Coronation refused
to promise these things, they endeavored to hinder their Coronation till they
had satisfaction in that point; that sometimes the Bishops, before their
Coronation, acquaint the People with the Constitution of the King and Kingdom,
how the King should behave himself to them, and in what things they were to
obey him, on which the practice of the Bishops in the case of Magna Charta, and
Charta de Forestis, gives us a sufficient Comment, sometimes the Archbishop at
their Coronation adjures them by God not to take the Crown upon them, unless
they uprightly intended to Observe their Oaths. Sometimes they promised Homage
and Allegiance only conditionally, provided that their Laws might be granted,
Of Hen. 1 M. Paris p. 38. Sub. rali igitur conventione supradisti Comites and
Barons juraverunt ^channi Duci Normanniae (...) and fideli servitium contra
omnes homines. Annal. Mon. Burton. p. 257. M. Paris p. 1^7.
and that the King would be true to his engagements, as in the case of Henry
the first, and of King John. Sometimes upon the attempts of their King's wholly
to violate their Rights, Liberties, and Properties, they give themback their
Homage, and resign it to them, and declare themselves no longer obliged to it,
nor guilty if they do not pay it: So that if there were no such evidence of a
contract as we have given, if the nature of a Political Government did not
require, and suppose it, If Liguntia est vinculum arctius inter subditum and
Regem utrosque invicem connectens, hunc ad protectionem and Justum Regimen,
illum adtribute and Justum Subjectionem. Glossar.
Sir H. Spelman had not so expressly said, that the Oath of Allegiance is
reciprocal betwixt King and Subject, yet these things plainly seen to prove the
Oath of Allegiance is, or was at least by our Fore fathers thought to be
reciprocal and if so; then have the generallity of Casuists plainly determined,
that it must cease on the one part, when the very substance of it is plainly
and perseveringly violated on the other: For both Cum aliquid promi^^um est ob
causam quae subesse putubatur, and non subest, ut si juraveris te facturum
aliquid eo quod beneficium aliquod te in petraturum sperabas, quod tamen non
impetras, tunc ad implendum promisum non teneris, quia conditio illa tacit in
Juramento fuit inclusa, si beneficium impetravero, condition autem non
impleta, promissio ipsa, licet jurata, obliga^e (...) B^ldwin de Cas. Consc. l.
2. c. 9. Cas 17. Rivet explic. Decal. p. 131, Mr. Tombs le^^ 18. p. 123, 124.
Bp. Sanderson de juram. praelect. 4. 8. p. 99.
Papists and Protestants unanimously agree in this, that when an Oath is
reciprocal, or conditional, if one part break the Covenant, and violate the
condition, the other is free from the Obligation of the Oath: For as a
conditional Proposition, say Logicians, puts nothing in being, but when the
condition is put, it becomes absolute; so a conditional Obligation becomes then
only absolute, when, and whilst the condition is put, and therefore cease
when it is removed. Besides, the Engagement on the one side would not have
been, without the engagement on the other; and therefore the performance of it
must depend on the performance of the other. And 3ly, Otherwise these Oaths
would serve only for a snare to honest men, as v. g. Put the case the Governors
of two Armies mutually swear not to fight in so many days, if one party
breaking his Oath, and fighting, the other be obliged by his Oath not to fight,
it would be all one as if he had sworn to deliver up himself, and his Army to
be butchered; which is contrary to the law of Nature: So in like manner, if a
King has so far violated his Oath, as to set himself directly to overthrow
those Laws, and to destroy that Church he bound himself by Oath to defend; If
he has not only engaged himself in a Religion, which binds him upon pain of
damnation to overthrow all the Laws made to keep it out, and to give up all his
Subjects to suffer all the punishments decreed by the Roman Church against
Heretics, that is, the loss of Goods and Life; If he has entered into a League
with another potent Monarch to set up Popery, and Arbitary Government in
England, and yet his Subjects must be obliged to bear Allegiance to him by
virtue of their Oaths; then must they be ensnared so far by them, as to deliver
up their Laws and Church to be destroyed, if not to assist their Prince in
doing of it.

I am not ignorant that Bishop Sanderson puts the case thus, Rex aliquis
simpliciter, and citra respectum ad fidelitatem subditorum, jurat se Regnum
administraturum just, and secundum Leges, subdui alio tempore simpliciter, and
citra respectum ad Principis Officium, jurant se ei debitam fidelitatem, and
obedientiam praestituros, utrique obligantur quod sui est Officii fideliter
facere, etsi defecerit altera pars a suo Officio, ita ut neque Rex solutus sit
suo juramento, si subditi debitum Obsequium non praestiterent, nec subditi suo,
si Rex a justitiae tramite deflexerit. De juramento prael. 4.. 8. p. 100.
A King one time swears simply, and without respect to the fidelity of his
Subjects, to govern the Kingdom justly, and according to the Laws; the Subjects
at another time simply, AND WITHOUT RESPECT TO THE PRINCE'S DVTY, swear to
yield him due Fidelity, and Obedience, they are both obliged faithfully to do
what is their duty, though the other party fail of his; so that neither is the
King absolved from his Oath, if the Subjects do not yield him their due
obedience, nor are the Subjects absolved from their duty, though the King
deviate from the way of Justice. By this decision I was a long time diverted
from ever thinking that the Oath of Allegiance was Reciprocal, or made by the
Subject with respect to the Duty, or the Oath of the King, or the nature of our
Kingly Government, though upon perusal of our Histories I find that all our
Ancestors thought otherwise, or at least acted as if they really believed the
Oath was reciprocal, and made with respect to the Obligation which was upon
their Sovereign, tacitly as by being a King, and expressly by his Oath at his
Coronation, to protect as well as the People as the Laws of the Kingdom. Nor is
there any thing in these words, besides the Authority of that great man, to
show the contrary. For,

1. When the King swears to protect his People, this sure does not oblige him
to protect an Outlaw, or a Rebel; it is therefore plain, that this part of the
Oath respects the fidelity of his People.

2. Whereas he says, the King simply, and without respect to the fidelity of
his Subjects, swears to govern the Kingdom justly, and according to the Laws,
it is very reasonable he should do so; because he is a King only by, and
according to the Laws, and because the Laws have provided him a remedy against
the undultifulness of any of his Subjects: If any particular Subject offend
against his Government, he can punish him by Law; if any number of them prove
Rebels, he can cut them off by Law; if all of them prove so, when he has power
sufficient he has them all at his mercy by Law, and they have forfeited both
Lives and Fortunes to him, and what could he desire more? Whereas, if the
Subject be bound to yield Allegiance to the King, though he deviate never so
much from the way of Justice, though he usurps as much upon their Lives and
Fortunes, without their violation of the Law, as if they were the worst of
Rebels, they are left in a very deplorable condition, nor is it any advantage
to them that they have fundamental Laws by which they ought to be governed, or
that the Government is Political and tied to the observance of the Laws, and
not absolute, or that the Governor is sworn to rule according to Law, seeing
upon his Sup osition, they are as much enslaved by their Oath of Allegiance, as
they could be, were their King absolute, tied to no Oaths or Laws, but free to
deal with them at his pleasure.

Nor does it alter the case at all, that the King swears to govern by Law at
one time, and many of them swear Allegiance at another: For besides what I have
showed, that the custom anciently was, and still is, at the very time of his
taking his Coronation Oath, for the Subjects to declare their acceptance of
him, thereupon as their King, and for some of all Orders to do him immediate
Homage in the name of the Rest, which seem to be evident marks of Stipulation,
and Mutual Engagement: I say, besides this it seems not at all material to the
business, when the Oath is taken, provided that the Ground, Reason, and
Foundation, or chief Motive of it, whenever it be taken, is the aforesaid
contract of the King to govern them by Law, either already made, or at his
Coronation to be made.

FINIS.
