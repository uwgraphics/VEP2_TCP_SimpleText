TEntasti, fateor, sine vulnere soepius, and me
Consultu^ voluit Vox, sine voce, frequens;
Ambivit placido divinior aur a meatu,
Et frustra sancto murmr praemonuit
Sur dus eram, mutusque Silex: Tu, (quanta tuorum
Cura tibi est!) alia das renovare via,
Permutas Curam: Iamque irritatus Amorem
Posse negas, and vim, Vi, superare paras,
Accedis propior, molemque, and Saxea rumpis
Pectora, fitque Caro, quod fuit ante Lapis
En lacerum! Coelosque tuos ardentia tandem
Fragmenta, and liquidas ex Adamante genas.
Sic olim undantes Petras, Scopulosque vomentes
Curasti, O populi providus usque tui!
Quam Miranda tibi manus est! Moriendo, revixi;
Et fractas jam sum ditior inter opes.


Silex Scintillans: or SACRED POEMS and Private Eiaculations By Henry Vaughan
Silurist

LONDON, Printed by. T: W. for H. Blunden at ye Castle in Cornehill. 1650

The Dedication.
MY God, thou that did dye for me,
These thy deaths fruits I offer thee.
Death that to me was life, and light
But dark, and deep pangs to thy sight.
Some drops of thy all-quickning blood
Fell on my heart, these made it bud
And put forth thus, though, Lord, before
The ground was cursed, and void of store.
Indeed, I had some here to hire
Which long resisted thy desire,
That stoned thy Servants, and did move
To have thee murdered for thy Love,
But, Lord, I have expelled them, and so bent
Beg thou would take thy Tenants Rent.
Silex Scintillans, etc.
Regeneration.
A Ward, and still in bonds, one day
I stole abroad,
It was high-spring, and all the way
Primros'd, and hung with shade;
Yet, was it frost within,
And surly winds
Blasted my infant buds, and sin
Like Clouds eclipsed my mind.
2.
Stormed thus; I straight perceived my spring
Mere stage, and show,
My walk a monstrous, mountain'd thing
Rough-cast with Rocks, and snow;
And as a Pilgrims Eye
Far from relief,
Measures the melancholy sky
Then drops, and rains for grief,
3.
So sighed I upwards still, at last
'Twixt steps, and falls
I reached the pinnacle, where placed
I found a pair of scales,
I took them up and laid
In the one late pains,
The other smoke, and pleasures weighed
But proved the heavier grains;
4.
With that, some cried, Away: straight I
Obeyed, and led
Full East, a fair, fresh field could spy
Some called it, Jacobs Bed;
A Virgin-soile, which no
Rude feet ere trod,
Where (since he stepped there,) only go
Prophets, and friends of God.
5.
Here, I reposed; but scarce well set,
A grove descryed
Of stately height, whose branches met
And mixed on every side;
I entered and once in
(Amazed to see it,)
Found all was changed, and a new spring
Did all my senses greet;
6.
The unthrift Sun shot vital gold
A thousand pieces,
And heaven its azure did unfold
Checqur'd with snowie fleeces,
The air was all in spice
And every bush
A garland wore; Thus fed my Eyes
But all the Ear lay hush.
7.
Only a little Fountain lent
Some use for Ears,
And on the dumb shades language spent
The Music of her tears;
I drew her near, and found
The Cisterne full
Of diverse stones, some bright, and round
Others ill-shap'd, and dull.
8.
The first (pray mark,) as quick as light
Danced through the flood,
But, th'last more heavy then the night
Nailed to the Center stood;
I wondered much, but tired
At last with thought,
My restless Eye that still desired
As strange an object brought;
9.
It was a bank of flowers, where I descried
(Though 'twas midday,)
Some fast asleep, others broad-eyed
And taking in the Ray,
Here musing long, I heard
A rushing wind
Which still increased, but whence it stirred
No where I could not find;
10.
I turned me round, and to each shade
Dispatched an Eye,
To see, if any leaf had made
Least motion, or Reply,
But while I listening sought
My mind to ease
By knowing, where 'twas, or where not,
It whispered; where I please.
Lord, then said I, On me one breath,
And let me dye before my death!
Cant. Cap. 5. ver. 17. Arise O North, and come thou South Wind, and blow upon
my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out.


Death. A Dialogue.
Soul. It Is a sad Land, that in one day
Has dulled thee thus, when death shall freeze
Thy blood to Ice, and thou must stay
Tenant for Years, and Centuries,
How will thou brook't? --

Body. I cannot tell, --
But if all sense wings not with thee,
And something still be left the dead,
I Will wish my Curtains off to free
Me from so dark, and sad a bed;
A neast of nights, a gloomie sphere,
Where shadows thicken, and the Cloud
Sits on the Suns brow all the year,
And nothing moves without a shroud;

Soul. It Is so: But as thou saw that night
We traveled in, our first attempts
Were dull, and blind, but Custom straight
Our fears, and falls brought to contempt,
Then, when the ghastly twelve was past
We breathed still for a blushing East,
And bad the lazy Sun make have,
And on sure hopes, though long, did feast;
But when we saw the Clouds to crack
And in those Cranies light appeared,
We thought the day then was not slack,
And pleased our selves with what we feared;
Just so it is in death. But thou
Shall in thy mothers bosom sleep
Whilst I each minute groan to know
How near Redemption creepes.
Then shall we meet to mix again, and met,
It Is last goodnight, our Sun shall never set.

Job. Cap: 10. ver. 21.22. Before I go whence I shall not return, even to the
land of darkness, and the shadow of death;

A Land of darkness, as darkness it self, and of the shadow of death,
without any order, and where the light is as darkness.


Resurrection and Immortality:
Heb. cap. 10. ve: 20. By that new, and living way, which he has prepared for
us, through the veil, which is his flesh.


Body. 1.
Often have I seen, when that renewing breath
That binds, and loosens death
Inspired a quickening power through the dead
Creatures a bed,
Some drowsy silk-worme creep
From that long sleep
And in weak, infant hummings chime, and knell
About her silent Cell
Until at last full with the vital Ray
She winged away,
And proud with life, and sense,
Heavens rich Expense,
Esteemed (vain things!) of two whole Elements
As mean, and span-extents.
Shall I then think such providence will be
Less friend to me?
Or that he can endure to be unjust
Who keeps his Covenant even with our dust.

Soul. 2.
Poor, querulous handful! was it for this
I taught thee all that is?
Unbowel'd nature, showed thee her recruits,
And Change of suits
And how of death we make
A mere mistake,
For no thing can to Nothing fall, but still
Incorporates by skill,
And then returns, and from the womb of things
Such treasure brings
As Phenix-like renew'th
Both life, and youth;
For a preserving spirit does still pass
Untainted through this Mass,
Which does resolve, produce, and ripen all
That to it fall;
Nor are those births which we
Thus suffering see
Destroyed at all; But when times restles wave
Their substance does deprave
And the more noble Essence finds his house
Sickly, and loose,
He, ever young, does wing
Unto that spring,
And source of spirits, where he takes his lot
Till time no more shall rot
His passive Cottage; which (though laid aside,)
Like some spruce Bride,
Shall one day rise, and clothed with shining light
All pure, and bright
Re-marry to the soul, for it is most plain
Thou only fal'st to be refined again.
3.
Then I that here saw darkly in a glass
But mists, and shadows pass,
And, by their own weak Shine, did search the springs
And Course of things
Shall with Enlightened Rays
Pierce all their ways;
And as thou saw, I in a thought could go
To heaven, or Earth below
To read some Star, or Min'rall, and in State
There often sat,
So shall thou then with me
(Both winged, and free,)
Rove in that mighty, and eternal light
Where no rude shade, or night
Shall dare approach us; we shall there no more
Watch stars, or pore
Through melancholy clouds, and say
Would it were Day!
One everlasting Saboth there shall run
Without Succession, and without a Sun.

Dan: Cap: 12. ver: 13. But go thou thy way until the end be, for thou shall
rest, and stand up in thy lot, at the end of the days.


Day of Judgment.
WHen through the North a fire shall rush
And roll into the East,
And like a fiery torrent brush
And sweep up South, and West,
When all shall stream, and lighten round
And with surprising flames
Both stars, and Elements confound
And quite blot out their names,
When thou shall spend thy sacred store
Of thunders in that heat
And low as ere they lay before
Thy six-dayes-buildings beat,
When like a scrowle the heavens shall pass
And vanish clean away,
And naught must stand of that vast space
Which held up night, and day,
When one loud blast shall rend the deep,
And from the womb of earth
Summon up all that are asleep
Unto a second birth,
When thou shall make the Clouds thy seat,
And in the open air
The Quick, and dead, both small and great
Must to thy bar repair;
O then it will be all too late
To say, what shall I do?
Repentance there is out of date
And so is mercy too;
Prepare, prepare me then, O God!
And let me now begin
To feel my loving fathers Rod
Killing the man of sin!
Give me, O give me Crosses here,
Still more afflictions lend,
That pill, though bitter, is most dear
That brings health in the end;
Lord, God! I beg nor friends, nor wealth
But pray against them both;
Three things I Would have, my souls chief health!
And one of these seem loath,
A living FAITH, a HEART of flesh,
The WORLD an Enemy,
This last will keep the first two fresh,
And bring me, where I Would be.
1 Pet. 4.7. Now the end of all things is at hand, be you therefore sober, and
watching in prayer.

Religion.
MY God, when I walk in those groves,
And leaves thy spirit does still fan,
I see in each shade that there grows
An Angel talking with a man.
Under a Juniper, some house,
Or the cool Mirtles canopie,
Others beneath an Oaks green boughs,
Or at some fountains bubling Eye;
Here Jacob dreams, and wrestles; there
Elias by a Raven is fed,
Another time by the Angel, where
He brings him water with his bread;
In Abr'hams Tent the winged guests
(O how familiar then was heaven!)
Eat, drink, discourse, sit down, and rest
Until the Cool, and shady Even;
Nay thou thy self, my God, in fire,
Whirle-winds, and Clouds, and the soft voice
Speak there so much, that I admire
We have no Conf'rence in these days;
Is the truce broke? or 'cause we have
A mediator now with thee,
Do thou therefore old Treaties wave
And by appeals from him decree?
Or is it so, as some green heads say
That now all miracles must cease?
Though thou have promised they should stay
The tokens of the Church, and peace;
No, no; Religion is a Spring
That from some secret, golden Mine
Derives her birth, and thence does bring
Cordials in every drop, and Wine;
But in her long, and hidden Course
Passing through the Earths dark veins,
Grows still from better unto worse,
And both her taste, and color stains,
Then drilling on, learnes to increase
False Echoes, and Confused sounds,
And unawares does often seize
On veins of Sulphur under ground;
So poisoned, breaks forth in some Clime,
And at first sight does many please,
But drunk, is puddle, or mere slime
And 'stead of Physic, a disease;
Just such a tainted sink we have
Like that Samaritans dead Well,
Nor must we for the Kernel crave
Because most voices like the shell.
Heal then these waters, Lord; or bring thy flock,
Since these are troubled, to the springing rock,
Look down great Master of the feast; O shine,
And turn once more our Water into Wine!
Cant. cap. 4. ver. 12. My sister, my spouse is as a garden Enclosed, as a
Spring shut up, and a fountain sealed up.

The Search.
It Is now clear day: I see a Rose
Bud in the bright East, and disclose
The Pilgrim-Sunne; all night have I
Spent in a roving Ecstasy
To find my Savior; I have been
As far as Bethlem, and have seen
His Inn, and Cradle; Being there
I met the Wisemen, asked them where
He might be found, or what star can
Now point him out, grown up a Man?
To Egypt hence I fled, ran over
All her parcht bosom to Nile's shore
Her yearly nurse; came back, inquired
Amongst the Doctors, and desired
To see the Temple, but was shown
A little dust, and for the Town
A heap of ashes, where some sed
A small bright sparkle was a bed,
Which would one day (beneath the pole,)
Awake, and then refine the whole.
Tired here, I come to Sychar; thence
To Jacobs well, bequeathed since
Unto his sons, (where often they
In those calm, golden Evenings lay
Watring their flocks, and having spent
Those white days, drove home to the Tent
Their well-fleec'd train;) And here (O fate!)
I sit, where once my Savior sat;
The angry Spring in bubbles swelled
Which broke in sighs still, as they filled,
And whispered, Jesus had been there
But Jacobs children would not hear.
Loath hence to part, at last I rise
But with the fountain in my Eyes,
And here a fresh search is decreed
He must be found, where he did bleed;
I walk the garden, and there see
Idaea's of his Agony,
And moving anguishments that set
His blessed face in a bloody sweat;
I climbed the Hill, perused the Cross
Hung with my gain, and his great loss,
Never did tree bear fruit like this,
Balsam of Souls, the bodies bliss;
But, O his grave! where I saw lent
(For he had none,) a Monument,
An undefiled, and new-heaw'd one,
But there was not the Cornerstone;
Sure (then said I,) my Quest is vain,
He Will not be found, where he was slain,
So mild a Lamb can never be
'Midst so much blood, and Cruelty;
I Will to the Wilderness, and can
Find beasts more merciful then man,
He lived there safe, 'twas his retreat
From the fierce Jew, and Herod's heat,
And forty days withstood the fell,
And high temptations of hell;
With Seraphins there talked he
His fathers flaming ministry,
He heav'nd their walks, and with his eyes
Made those wild shades a Paradise,
Thus was the desert sanctified
To be the refuge of his bride;
I Will thither then; see, It is day,
The Sun's broke through to guide my way.
But as I urged thus, and writ down
What pleasures should my Journey crown,
What silent paths, what shades, and Cells,
Fair, virgin-flowers, and hallowed Wells
I should rove in, and rest my head
Where my dear Lord did often tread,
Sugring all dangers with success,
Me thought I heard one singing thus;
1.
Leave, leave thy gadding thoughts;
Who Pores
and spies
Still out of Doors
descries
Within them naught.
2.
The skin, and shell of things
Though fair,
are not
Thy wish, nor Prayer,
but got
By mere Despair
of wings.
3.
To rack old Elements,
Or Dust;
and say
Sure here he must
needs stay
Is not the way,
nor Just.
Search well another world; who studies this,
Travels in Clouds, seeks Manna, where none is.
Acts Cap. 17. ve. 27, 28. That they should seek the Lord, if happily they
might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far off from every one of
us, for in him we live, and move, and have our being.


Isaacs Marriage.
Genesis cap. 24. ver. 63. And Isaac went out to pray in the field at the
Even-tide, and he lift up his eyes, and saw, and behold, the Camels were
coming.


PRaying! and to be married? It was rare,
But now it is monstrous; and that pious care
Though of our selves, is so much out of date,
That to renew't, were to degenerate.
But thou a Chosen sacrifice were given,
And offered up so early unto heaven
Thy flames could not be out; Religion was
Ray'd into thee, like beams into a glass,
Where, as thou grewst, it multiplied, and shined
The sacred Constellation of thy mind.
But being for a bride, sure, prayer was
Very strange stuff wherewith to court thy less,
Had never an oath, nor Complement? thou were
An odd, corse suitor; Had thou but the art
Of these our days, thou could have coined thee twenty
New several oaths, and Complements (too) plenty;
O sad, and wild excess! and happy those
White days, that durst no impious mirth expose!
When sin, by sinning often, had not lost sense,
Nor bold-fac'd custom banished Innocence;
Thou had no pompous train, nor Antic crowd
Of young, gay swearers, with their needless, loud
Retinue; All was here smooth as thy bride
And calm like her, or that mild Evening-tide;
Yet, had thou nobler guests: Angels did wind,
And rove about thee, guardians of thy mind,
These fetched thee home thy bride, and all the way
Advised thy servant what to do, and say;
These taught him at the Well, and thither brought
The Chaste, and lovely object of thy thought;
But here was never a Complement, not one
Spruce, supple cringe, or studied look put on,
All was plain, modest truth: Nor did she come
In rowles, and Curles, mincing, and stately dumb,
But in a frighted, virgin-blush approached
Fresh as the morning, when it is newly Coach'd;
O sweet, divine simplicity! O grace
Beyond a Curled lock, or painted face!
A Pitcher too she had, nor thought it much
To carry that, which some would scorn to touch;
With which in mild, chaste language she did woo
To draw him drink, and for his Camels too.
And now thou knewst her coming, It was time
To get thee wings on, and devoutly climb
Unto thy God, for Marriage of all states
Makes most unhappy, or most fortunates;
This brought thee forth, where now thou did undresse
Thy soul, and with new pinions refresh
Her wearied wings, which so restored did fly
Above the stars, a track unknown, and high,
And in her piercing flight perfumed the air
Scattering the Myrrh, and Incense of thy prayer.
So from A well in the South Country where Jacob dwelt, between Cadesh, and
Bered; Heb. the well of him that lives, and sees me.
Lahai-roi's Well, some spicie cloud
Wooed by the Sun swells up to be his shroud,
And from his moist womb weeps a fragrant shower,
Which, scattered in a thousand pearls* each flower
And herb partakes, where having stood awhile
And something coold the parched, and thirsty Isle,
The thankful Earth unlocks her self, and blends,
A thousand odours, which (all mixed,) she sends
Up in one cloud, and so returns the skies
That dew they lent, a breathing sacrifice.
Thus soared thy soul, who (though young,) did inherit
Together with his blood, thy fathers spirit,
Whose active zeal, and tried faith were to thee
Familiar ever since thy Infancy,
Others were tym'd, and trained up to it, but thou
Did thy swift years in piety out-grow,
Age made them reverend, and a snowie head,
But thou were so, e're time his snow could shed;
Then, who would truly limne thee out, must paint
First, a young Patriarch, then a married Saint.
The British Church.
AH! he is fled!
And while these here their mists, and shadows hatch,
My glorious head
Does on those hills of Myrrh, and Incense watch.
Have, have my dear,
The Soldiers here
Cast in their lotts again,
That seamless coat
The Jews touched not,
These dare divide, and stain.
2.
O get thee wings!
Ot if as yet (until these clouds depart,
And the day springs,)
Thou think it good to tarry where thou art,
Write in thy books
My ravished looks
Slain flock, and pillaged fleeces,
And haste thee so
As a young Roe
Upon the mounts of spices.
O Rosa Campi! O lilium Convallium! quomodo nunc facta es pabulum Aprorum!

The Lamp.
It Is dead night round about: Horror does creep
And move on with the shades; stars nod, and sleep,
And through the dark air spin a fiery thread
Such as does gild the lazy glowworms bed.
Yet, burn'st thou here, a full day; while I spend
My rest in Cares, and to the dark world lend
These flames, as thou do thine to me; I watch
That hour, which must thy life, and mine dispatch;
But still thou do out-goe me, I can see
Met in thy flames, all acts of piety;
Thy light, is Charity; Thy heat, is Zeal;
And thy aspiring, active fires reveal
Devotion still on wing; Then, thou do weep
Still as thou burn'st, and the warm droppings creep
To measure out thy length, as if thou would know
What stock, and how much time were left thee now;
Nor do thou spend one tear in vain, for still
As thou dissolv'st to them, and they distill,
They Are stored up in the socket, where they lie,
When all is spent, thy last, and sure supply,
And such is true repentance, every breath
We spend in sighs, is treasure after death;
Only, one point escapes thee; That thy Oil
Is still out with thy flame, and so both fail;
But when soever I Am out, both shall be in,
And where thou made an end, there I Will begin.
Mark Cap. 13. ver. 35. Watch you therefore, for you know not when the master
of the house comes, at Even, or at midnight, or at the Cock-crowing, or in
the morning.


Man's fall, and Recovery.
FArewell you Everlasting hills! I Am Cast
Here under Clouds, where storms, and tempests blast
This sullied flower
Robbed of your Calm, nor can I ever make
Transplanted thus, one leaf of his t'awake,
But every hour
He sleeps, and droops, and in this drowsy state
Leaves me a slave to passions, and my fate;
Besides I Have lost
A train of lights, which in these Sunshine days
Were my sure guides, and only with me stays
(Unto my cost,)
One sullen beam, whose charge is to dispense
More punishment, than knowledge to my sense;
Two thousand years
I sojourned thus; at last Jeshuruns king
Those famous tables did from Sinai bring;
These swelled my fears,
Guilts, trespasses, and all this Inward Awe,
For sin took strength, and vigor from the Law.
Yet have I found
A plenteous way, (thanks to that holy one!)
To cancel all that e're was writ in stone,
His saving wound
Wept blood, that broke this Adamant, and gave
To sinners Confidence, life to the grave;
This makes me span
My fathers journeys, and in one fair step
Over all their pilgrimage, and labors leap,
For God (made man,)
Reduced The Extent of works of faith; so made
Of their Red Sea, a Spring; I wash, they wade.
Romans Cap. 18. ver. 19. As by the offense of one, the fault came on all men to
condemnation; So by the Righteousness of one, the benefit abounded toward all
men to the Justification of life.


The Shower.
'TWas so, I saw thy birth: That drowsy Lake
From her faint bosom breathed thee, the disease
Of her sick waters, and Infectious Ease.
But, now at Even
Too gross for heaven,
Thou fall'st in tears, and weep'st for thy mistake.
2.
Ah! it is so with me; often have I pressed
Heaven with a lazy breath, but fruitles this
Pierced not; Love only can with quick access
Unlock the way,
When all else stray
The smoke, and Exhalations of the breast.
3.
Yet, if as thou do melt, and with thy train
Of drops make soft the Earth, my eyes could weep
Over my hard heart, that is bound up, and asleep,
Perhaps at last
(Some such showers past,)
My God would give a Sunshine after rain.
Distraction.
O Knit me, that am crumbled dust! the heap
Is all dispersed, and cheap;
Give for a handful, but a thought
And it is bought;
Had thou
Made me a star, a pearl, or a rainbow,
The beams I then had shot
My light had lessend not,
But now
I find my self the less, the more I grow;
The world
Is full of voices; Man is called, and hurled
By each, he answers all,
Knows every note, and call,
Hence, still
Fresh dotage tempts, or old usurps his will.
Yet, had thou clipped my wings, when Coffined in
This quickened mass of sin,
And saved that light, which freely thou
Did then bestow,
I fear
I should have spurned, and said thou did forbear;
Or that thy store was less,
But now since thou did bless
So much,
I grieve, my God! that thou have made me such.
I grieve?
O, yes! thou know I do; Come, and relieve
And tam^, and keep down with thy light
Dust that would rise, and dim my sight,
Lest left alone too long
Amidst the noise, and throng,
Oppressed I
Striving to save the whole, by parcells dye.
The Pursuit.
LOrd! what a busy, restles thing
Have thou made man?
Each day, and hour he is on wing,
Rests not a span;
Then having lost the Sun, and light
By clouds surpised
He keeps a Commerce in the night
With air disguised;
Had thou given to this active dust
A state untir'd,
The lost Son had not left the husk
Nor home desired;
That was thy secret, and it is
Thy mercy too,
For when all fails to bring to bliss,
Then, this must do.
Ah! Lord! and what a Purchase will that be
To take us sick, that sound would not take thee?
Mount of Olives.
Sweet, sacred hill! on whole fair brow
My Savior sat, shall I allow
Language to love
And Idolize some shade, or grove,
Neglecting thee? such ill-plac'd wit,
Conceit, or call it what you please
Is the brains fit,
And mere disease;
2.
Cotswold, and Coopers both have met
With learned swains, and Echo yet
Their pipes, and wit;
But thou sleep'st in a deep neglect
Untouched by any; And what need
The sheep bleat thee a silly Lay
That heard'st both reed
And sheepward play?
3.
Yet, if Poets mind thee well
They shall find thou art their hill,
And fountain too,
Their Lord with thee had most to do;
He wept once, walked whole nights on thee,
And from thence (his sufferings ended,)
Unto glory
Was attended;
4.
Being there, this spacious ball
Is but his narrow footstool all,
And what we think
Unsearchable, now with one wink
He does comprise; But in this air
When he did stay to bear our Ill
And sin, this Hill
Was then his Chair.
The Incarnation, and Passion.
LOrd! when thou did thy self undresse
Laying by thy robes of glory,
To make us more, thou would be less,
And becam'st a woeful story.
To put on Clouds instead of light,
And cloth the morning-starre with dust,
Was a translation of such height
As, but in thee, was never expressed;
Brave worms, and Earth! that thus could have
A God Enclosed within your Cell,
Your maker pent up in a grave,
Life locked in death, heaven in a shell;
Ah, my dear Lord! what could thou spy
In this impure, rebellious clay,
That made thee thus resolve to dye
For those that kill thee every day?
O what strange wonders could thee move
To slight thy precious blood, and breath!
Sure it was Love, my Lord; for Love
Is only stronger far than death.
The Call.
COme my heart! come my head
In sighs, and tears!
It Is now, since you have lain thus dead
Some twenty years;
Awake, awake,
Some pity take
Upon your selves --
Who never wake to groan, nor weep,
Shall be sentenced for their sleep.
2.
Do but see your sad estate,
how many sands
Have left us, while we careless sat
With folded hands;
What stock of nights,
Of days, and years
In silent flights
Stole by our ears,
How ill have we our selves bestowed
Whose suns are all set in a Cloud?
3.
Yet, come, and let us peruse them all;
And as we pass,
What sins on every minute fall
Score on the glass;
Then weigh, and rate
Their heavy State
Until
The glass with tears you fill;
That done, we shall be safe, and good,
Those beasts were clean, that chewed the Cud.

THou that know for whom I mourn,
And why these tears appear,
That keep'st account, till he return
Of all his dust left here;
As easily thou might prevent
As now produce these tears,
And add unto that day he went
A fair supply of years.
But 'twas my sin that forced thy hand
To cull this Prim-rose out,
That by thy early choice forewarned
My soul might look about.
O what a vanity is man!
How like the Eyes quick wink
His Cottage fails; whose narrow span
Begins even at the brink!
Nine months thy hands are fashioning us,
And many years (alas!)
E're we can lisp, or ought discuss
Concerning thee, must pass;
Yet have I known thy slightest things
A feather, or a shell,
A stick, or Rod which some Chance brings
The best of us excel,
Yea, I have known these shreds out last
A faire-compacted frame
And for one Twenty we have past
Almost outlive our name.
Thus have thou placed in man's outside
Death to the Common Eye,
That heaven within him might abide,
And close eternity;
Hence, youth, and folly (man's first shame,)
Are put unto the slaughter,
And serious thoughts begin to tame
The wise-mans-madnes Laughter;
Dull, wretched worms! that would not keep
Within our first fair bed,
But out of Paradise must creep
For every foot to tread;
Yet, had our Pilgrimage bin free,
And smooth without a thorn,
Pleasures had foiled Eternity,
And ^a^e, had choakt the Corn.
Thus by the Cross Salvation runs,
Affliction is a mother,
Whose painful throws yield many sons,
Each fairer than the other;
A silent tear can pierce thy throne,
When loud Joys want a wing,
And sweeter aires stream from a groan,
Than any arted string;
Thus, Lord, I see my gain is great,
My less but little to it,
Yet something more I must entreat
And only thou can do it.
O let me (like him,) know my End!
And be as glad to find it,
And whatsoever thou shall Commend,
Still let thy Servant mind it!
Then make my soul white as his own,
My faith as pure, and steady,
And deck me, Lord, with the same Crown
Thou have crowned him already!
Vanity of Spirit.
QUite spent with thoughts I left my Cell, and lay
Where a shrill spring tuned to the early day.
I begged here long, and gron'd to know
Who gave the Clouds so brave a bow,
Who bent the spheres, and circled in
Corruption with this glorious Ring,
What is his name, and how I might
Descry some part of his great light.
I summoned nature: pierced through all her store,
Broke up some seals, which none had touched before,
Her womb, her bosom, and her head
Where all her secrets lay a bed
I rifled quite, and having past
Through all the Creatures, came at last
To search my self, where I did find
Traces, and sounds of a strange kind.
Here of this mighty spring, I found some drills,
With Echoes beaten from the eternal hills;
Weak beams, and fires flashed to my sight,
Like a young East, or Moone-shine night,
Which showed me in a nook cast by
A piece of much antiquity,
With Hyerogliphicks quite dismembered,
And broken letters scarce remembered.
I took them up, and (much Joy'd,) went about
TO unite those pieces, hoping to find out
The mystery; but this near done,
That little light I had was gone:
It grieved me much. At last, said I,
Since in these veyls my Eclipsed Eye
May not approach thee, (for at night
Who can have commerce with the light?)
I Will disapparell, and to buy
But one half glaunce, most gladly dye.
The Retreat.
HAppy those early days! when I
Shined in my Angell-infancy.
Before I understood this place
Appointed for my second race,
Or taught my soul to fancy ought
But a white, Celestial thought,
When yet I had not walked above
A mile, or two, from my first love,
And looking back (at that short space,)
Could see a glimpse of his bright-face;
When on some gilded Cloud, or flower
My gazing soul would dwell an hour,
And in those weaker glories spy
Some shadows of eternity;
Before I taught my tongue to wound
My Conscience with a sinful sound,
Or had the black art to dispense
A several sin to every sense,
But felt through all this fleshly dress
Bright shootes of everlastingnesse.
O how I long to travel back
And tread again that ancient track!
That I might once more reach that plain,
Where first I left my glorious train,
From whence the Enlightened spirit sees
That shady City of Palm trees;
But (ah!) my soul with too much stay
Is drunk, and staggers in the way.
Some men a forward motion love,
But I by backward steps would move,
And when this dust falls to the urn
In that state I came return.

COme, come, what do I here?
Since he is gone
Each day is grown a dozen year,
And each hour, one;
Come, come!
Cut off the sum,
By these soiled tears!
(Which only thou
Know to be true,)
Days are my fears.
2.
There Is not a wind can stir,
Or beam pass by,
But strait I think (though far,)
Thy hand is nigh;
Come, come!
Strike these lips dumb*
This restles breath
That soiles thy name,
Will never be tame
Until in death.
3.
Perhaps some think a tomb
No house of store,
But a dark, and sealed up womb,
Which never breeds more.
Come, come!
Such thoughts benum;
But I would be
With him I weep
A bed, and sleep
To wake in thee.
Midnight.
WHen to my Eyes
(Whilst deep sleep others catches,)
Thine host of spies
The stars shine in their watches,
I do survey
Each busy Ray,
And how they work, and wind,
And wish each beam
My soul does stream,
With the like ardour shined;
What Emanations,
Quick vibrations
And bright stirs are there?
What thin Ejections,
Cold Affections,
And slow motions here?
2.
Thy heavens (some say,)
Are a firie-liquid light,
Which mingling aye
Streams, and flames thus to the sight.
Come then, my god!
Shine on this blood,
And water in one beam,
And thou shall see
Kindled by thee
Both liquors burn, and stream.
O what bright quicknes,
Active brightness,
And celestial flows
Will follow after
On that water,
Which thy spirit blows!
Math. Cap. 3. ver. XI. I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance, but he
that comes after me, is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to
bear, he shall baptize you with the holy Ghost, and with fire.


Content.
PEace, peace! I know 'twas brave,
But this corse fleece
I shelter in, is slave
To no such piece.
When I am gone,
I shall no ward-robes leave
To friend, or son
But what their own homes weave,
2.
Such, though not proud, nor full,
May make them weep,
And mourn to see the wool
Outlast the sheep;
Poor, Pious wear!
Had thou bin rich, or fine
Perhaps that tear
Had mourned thy loss, not mine.
3.
Why then these curled, puffed points,
Or a laced story?
Death sets all out of Joint
And scorns their glory;
Some Love a Rose
In hand, some in the skin;
But cross to those,
I would have mine within.

JOy of my life! while left me here,
And still my Love!
How in thy absence thou do steer
Me from above!
A life well lead
This truth commends,
With quick, or dead
It never ends.
2.
Stars are of mighty use: The night
Is dark, and long;
The Rode foul, and where one goes right,
Six may go wrong.
One twinkling ray
Shot o'r some cloud,
May clear much way
And guide a crowd.
3.
Gods Saints are shining lights: who stays
Here long must pass
Over dark hills, swift streams, and steep ways
As smooth as glass;
But these all night
Like Candles, shed
Their beams, and light
Us into Bed.
4.
They are (indeed,) our Pillar-fires
Seen as we go,
They are that Cities shining spires
We travel too;
A swordlike gleame
Kept man for sin
First Out; This beam
Will guide him In.
The Storm.
I See the use: and know my blood
Is not a Sea,
But a shallow, bounded flood
Though red as he;
Yet have I flows, as strong as his,
And boiling stremes that rave
With the same curling force, and hiss,
As does the mountain'd wave.
2.
But when his waters billow thus,
Dark storms, and wind
Incite them to that fierce discuss,
Else not Inclined,
Thus the Enlarged, enraged air
Uncalmes these to a flood,
But still the weather that is most fair
Breeds tempests in my blood;
3.
Lord, then round me with weeping Clouds,
And let my mind
In quick blasts sigh beneath those shrouds
A spirit-wind,
So shall that storm purge this Recluse
Which sinful ease made foul,
And wind, and water to thy use
Both wash, and wing my soul.
The Morning-watch.
O Joys! Infinite sweetness! with what flowers,
And shoots of glory, my soul breaks, and buds!
All the long hours
Of night, and Rest
Through the still shrouds
Of sleep, and Clouds,
This Dew fell on my Breast;
O how it Bloods,
And Spirits all my Earth! hark! In what Rings,
And Hymning Circulations the quick world
Awakes, and sings;
The rising winds,
And falling springs,
Birds, beasts, all things
Adore him in their kinds.
Thus all is hurled
In sacred Hymns, and Order, The great Chime
And Symphony of nature. Prayer is
The world in tune,
A spirit-voyce,
And vocal joys
Whose Echo is heavens bliss.
O let me climb
When I lie down! The Pious soul by night
Is like a clouded star, whose beams though sed
To shed their light
Under some Cloud
Yet are above,
And shine, and move
Beyond that mistie shroud.
So in my Bed
That Curtain'd grave, though sleep, like ashes, hide
My lamp, and life, both shall in thee abide.
The Evening-watch. A Dialogue.
FArewell! I go to sleep; Body.
but when
The day star springs, I Will wake again.
Go, sleep in peace; Soul.
and when thou lie
Unnumber'd in thy dust when all this frame
Is but one dram, and what thou now descriest
In several parts shall want a name,
Then may his peace be with thee, and each dust
Writ in his book, who never betrayed man's trust!
Amen! but hark, ever we two stray, Body.

How many hours do think 'till day?
Ah! go; thou art weak, and sleepie. Soul.
Heaven
Is a plain watch, and without figures winds
All ages up; who drew this Circle even
He fills it; Days, and hours are Blinds.
Yet, this take with thee; The last gasp of time
Is thy first breath, and man's eternal Prime.

SIlence, and stealth of days! it is now
Since thou art gone,
Twelve hundred hours, and not a brow
But Clouds hang on.
As he that in some Caves thick damp
Locked from the light,
Fixes a solitary lamp,
To brave the night,
And walking from his Sun, when past
That glim'ring Ray
Cuts through the heavy mists in haste
Back to his day,
So o'r fled minutes I retreat
Unto that hour
Which showed thee last, but did defeat
Thy light, and power,
I search, and rack my soul to see
Those beams again,
But nothing but the snuff to me
Appears plain;
That dark, and dead sleeps in its known,
And common urn,
But those fled to their Makers throne,
There shine, and burn;
O could I track them! but souls must
Track one the other,
And now the spirit, not the dust
Must be thy brother.
Yet I have one Pearl by whose light
All things I see,
And in the heart of Earth, and night
Find Heaven, and thee.
Church Service.
Blessed be the God of Harmony, and Love!
The God above!
And holy dove!
Whose Interceding, spiritual groans
Make restless mones
For dust, and stones,
For dust in every part,
But a hard, stonic heart.
2
O how in this thy Quire of Souls I stand
(Propt by thy hand)
A heap of sand!
Which busy thoughts (like winds) would scatter quite
And put to flight,
But for thy might;
Thy hand alone does tame
Those blasts, and knit my frame,
3.
So that both stones, and dust, and all of me
Jointly agree
To cry to thee,
And in this Music by thy Martyrs blood
Sealed, and made good
Present, O God!
The Echo of these stones
-- My sighs, and groans.
Burial.
O Thou! The first fruits of the dead,
And their dark bed,
When I am cast into that deep
And senseless sleep
The wages of my sin,
O then,
Thou great Preserver of all men!
Watch over that loose
And empty house,
Which I sometimes lived in.
2.
It is (in truth!) a ruined piece
Not worth thy Eyes,
And scarce a room but wind, and rain
Beat through, and stain
The seats, and Cells within;
Yet thou
Led by thy Love would stoop thus low,
And in this Cort
All filth, and spott,
Did with thy servant Inn.
3.
And nothing can, I hourly see,
Drive thee from me,
Thou art the same, faithful, and just
In life, or Dust;
Though then (thus crumm'd) I stray
In blasts,
Or Exhalations, and wastes
Beyond all Eyes
Yet thy love spies
That Change, and knows thy Clay.
4.
The world's thy box: how then (there roast,)
Can I be lost?
But the delay is all; Time now
Is old, and slow,
His wings are dull, and sickly;
Yet he
Thy servant is, and waits on thee,
Cut then the sum,
Lord haste, Lord come,
O come Lord Jesus quickly!
Romans Cap. 8. ver. 23. And not only they, but our selves also, which have the
first fruits of the spirit, even we our selves groan within our selves,
waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.


Cheerfulness.
LOrd, with what courage, and delight
I do each thing
When thy least breath sustaines my wing!
I shine, and move
Like those above,
And (with much gladness
Quitting sadness,)
Make me fair days of every night.
2.
Affliction thus, mere pleasure is,
And hap what will,
If thou be in it, it is welcome still;
But since thy rays
In Sunnie days
Thou do thus lend
And freely spend,
Ah! what shall I return for this?
3.
O that I were all Soul! that thou
Would make each part
Of this poor, sinful frame pure heart!
Then would I drown
My single one,
And to thy praise
A Consort raise
Of Hallelujahs here below.

SUre, there is a tie of Bodies! and as they
Dissolve (with it,) to Clay,
Love languisheth, and memory does rust
O'r-cast with that cold dust;
For things thus Centered, without Beams, or Action
Nor give, nor take Contaction,
And man is such a Marygold, these fled,
That shuts, and hangs the head.
2.
Absents within the Line Conspire, and Sense
Things distant does unite,
Herbs sleep unto the East, and some fowls thence
Watch the Returns of light;
But hearts are not so kind: false, short delights
Tell us the world is brave,
And wrap us in Imaginary flights
Wide of a faithful grave;
Thus Lazarus was carried out of town;
For it is our foes chief art
By distance all good objects first to drown,
And then besiege the heart.
But I will be my own Deaths-head; and though
The flatt'rer say, I live,
Because Incertainties we cannot know
Be sure, not to believe.
Peace.
MY Soul, there is a Country
Far beyond the stars,
Where stands a winged Centrie
All skillful in the wars,
There above noise, and danger
Sweet peace sits crowned with smiles,
And one born in a Manger
Commands the Beauteous files,
He is thy gracious friend,
And (O my Soul awake!)
Did in pure love descend
To die here for thy sake,
If thou can get but thither,
There grows the flower of peace,
The Rose that cannot wither,
Thy fortress, and thy ease;
Leave then thy foolish ranges;
For none can thee secure,
But one, who never changes,
Thy God, thy life, thy Cure.
The Passion.
O My chief good!
My dear, dear God!
When thy blessed blood
Did Issue forth forced by the Rod,
What pain did thou
Feel in each blow!
How did thou weep,
And thy self steep
In thy own precious, saving tears!
What cruel smart
Did tear thy heart!
How did thou groan it
In the spirit,
O thou, whom my soul Loves, and fears!
2.
Most blessed Vine!
Whose juice so good
I feel as Wine,
But thy fair branches felt as blood,
How were thou pressed
To be my feast!
In what deep anguish
Did thou languish,
What springs of Sweat, and blood did drown thee!
How in one path
Did the full wrath
Of thy great Father
Crowd, and gather,
Doubling thy griefs, when none would own thee!
3.
How did the weight
Of all our sins,
And death unite
To wrench, and Rack thy blessed limbs*
How pale, and bloody
Looked thy Body!
How bruised, and broke
With every stroke!
How meek, and patient was thy spirit!
How did thou cry,
And groan on high
Father forgive,
And let them live,
I dye to make my foes inherit!
4.
O blessed Lamb!
That took'st my sin,
That took'st my shame
How shall thy dust thy praises sing!
I would I were
One hearty tear!
One constant spring!
Then would I bring
Thee two small mites, and be at strife
Which should most vie,
My heart, or eye,
Teaching my years
In smiles, and tears
To weep, to sing, thy Death, my Life.
Romans Cap. 8. ver. 19. Etenim res Creatae exerto Capite observantes expectant
revelationem Filiorum Dei.


ANd do they so? have they a Sense
Of ought but Influence?
Can they their heads lift, and expect,
And groan too? why The Elect
Can do no more: my volumes sed
They were all dull, and dead,
They judged them senseless, and their state
Wholly Inanimate.
Go, go; Seal up thy looks,
And burn thy books.
2.
I would I were a stone, or tree,
Or flower by pedigree,
Or some poor highway herb, or Spring
To flow, or bird to sing!
Then should I (tied to one sure state,)
All day expect my date;
But I am sadly loose, and stray
A giddy blast each way;
O let me not thus range!
Thou can not change.
3.
Sometimes I fit with thee, and tarry
An hour, or so, then vary.
Thy other Creatures in this Scene
Thee only aim, and mean;
Some rise to seek thee, and with heads
Erect peep from their beds;
Others, whose birth is in the tomb,
And cannot quit the womb,
Sigh there, and groan for thee,
Their liberty.
4.
O let not me do less! shall they
Watch, while I sleep, or play?
Shall I thy mercies still abuse
With fancies, friends, or news?
O brook it not! thy blood is mine,
And my soul should be thine;
O brook it not! why will thou stop
After whole showers one drop?
Sure, thou will joy to see
Thy sheep with thee.
The Relapse.
MY God, how gracious art thou! I had slipped
Almost to hell,
And on the verge of that dark, dreadful pit
Did hear them yell,
But O thy love! thy rich, almighty love
That saved my soul,
And checked their fury, when I saw them move,
And heard them howl;
O my sole Comfort, take no more these ways,
This hideous path,
And I will mend my own without delays,
Cease thou thy wrath!
I have deserved a thick, Egyptian damp,
Dark as my deeds,
Should mist within me, and put out that lamp
Thy spirit feeds;
A darting Conscience full of stabs, and fears;
No shade but Yewgh,
Sullen, and sad Ecclipses, Cloudie spheres,
These are my due.
But he that with his blood, (a price too dear,)
My scores did pay,
Bid me, by virtue from him, challenge here
The brightest day;
Sweet, downie thoughts; soft Lilly-shades; Calm streams*
Joys full, and true;
Fresh, spicie mornings; and eternal beams
These are his due.
The Resolve.
I Have considered it; and find
A longer stay
Is but excused neglect. To mind
One path, and stray
Into another, or to none,
Cannot be love;
When shall that traveller come home,
That will not move?
If thou would thither, linger not,
Catch at the place,
Tell youth, and beauty they must rot,
They Are but a Case;
Loose, parcell'd hearts will freeze; The Sun
With scattered locks
Scarce warms, but by contraction
Can heat rocks;
Call in thy Powers; run, and reach
Home with the light,
Be there, before the shadows stretch,
And Span up night;
Follow the Cry no more: there is
An ancient way
All strewed with flowers, and happiness
And fresh as May;
There turn, and turn no more; Let wits,
Smile at fair eyes,
Or lips; But who there weeping sits,
Has got the Prize.
The Match.
DEar friend! whose holy, ever-living lines
Have done much good
To many, and have checked my blood,
My fierce, wild blood that still heaves, and inclines,
But is still tamed
By those bright fires which thee inflamed;
Here I join hands, and thrust my stubborn heart
Into thy Deed,
There from no Duties to be freed,
And if hereafter youth, or folly thwart
And claim their share,
Here I renounce the poisonous ware.
ii.
ACcept, dread Lord, the poor Oblation,
It is but poor,
Yet through thy Mercies may be more.
O thou! that can not wish my souls damnation,
Afford me life,
And save me from all inward strife!
Two Life's I hold from thee, my gracious Lord*
Both cost thee deer,
For one, I am thy Tenant here;
The other, the true life, in the next world
And endless is,
O let me still mind that in this!
To thee therefore my Thoughts, Words, Actions
I do resign,
Thy will in all be done, not mine.
Settle my house, and shut out all distractions
That may unknit
My heart, and thee planted in it;
Lord Jesu! thou did bow thy blessed head
Upon a tree,
O do as much, now unto me!
O hear, and heal thy servant! Lord, strike dead
All lusts in me,
Who only wish life to serve thee?
Suffer no more this dust to overflow
And drown my eyes,
But seal, or pin them to thy skies.
And let this grain which here in tears I sow
Though dead, and sick,
Through thy Increase grow new, and quick.
Rules and Lessons.
WHen first thy Eyes unveil, give thy Soul leave
To do the like; our Bodies but forerun
The spirits duty; True hearts spread, and heave
Unto their God, as flowers do to the Sun.
Give him thy first thoughts then; so shall thou keep
Him company all day, and in him sleep.
Yet, never sleep the Sun up; Prayer should
Dawn with the day; There are set, awful hours
'Twixt heaven, and us; The Manna was not good
After Sunrising, far-day sullies flowers.
Rise to prevent the Sun; sleep does sins glut,
And heavens gate opens, when this world's is shut.
Walk with thy fellow creatures: note the hush
And whispers amongst them. There Is not a Spring,
Or Leaf but has his Morning-hymn; Each Bush
And Oak does know I AM; can thou not sing?
O leave thy Cares, and follies! go this way
And thou art sure to prosper all the day.
Serve God before the world; let him not go
Until thou have a blessing, then resign
The whole unto him; and remember who
Prevailed by wrestling ere the Sun did shine.
Pour Oil upon the stones, weep for thy sin,
Then journey on, and have an eye to heaven.
Mornings are Mysteries; the first worlds Youth,
Man's Resurrection, and the futures Bud
Shroud in their births: The Crown of life, light, truth
Is styled their star, the stone, and hidden food.
Three blessings wait upon them, two of which
Should move; They make us holy, happy, rich*
When the world's up, and every swarm abroad,
Keep thou thy temper, mix not with each Clay;
Dispatch necessities, life has a load
Which must be carried on, and safely may.
Yet keep those cares without thee, let the heart
Be Gods alone, and choose the better part.
Through all thy Actions, Counsels, and Discourse,
Let Mildness, and Religion guide thee out,
If truth be thine, what needs a brutish force?
But what is not good, and just never go about.
Wrong not thy Conscience for a rotten stick,
That gain is dreadful, which makes spirits sick.
To God, thy Country, and thy friend be true,
If Priest, and People change, keep thou thy ground.
Who sels Religion, is a Judas Jew,
And, oaths once broke, the soul cannot be sound.
The perjurer's a devil let loose: what can
Tie up his hands, that dares mock God, and man?
Seek not the same steps with the Crowd; stick thou
To thy sure trot; a Constant, humble mind
Is both his own Joy, and his Makers too;
Let folly dust it on, or lag behind.
A sweet self-privacy in a right soul
Out-runs the Earth, and lines the utmost pole.
To all that seek thee, bear an open heart;
Make not thy breast a Labyrinth, or Trap;
If trials come, this will make good thy part,
For honesty is safe, come what can hap;
It is the good man's feast; The prince of flowers
Which thrives in storms, and smells best after showers.
Seal not thy Eyes up from the poor, but give
Proportion to their Merits, and thy Purse;
Thou mai'st in Rags a mighty Prince relieve
Who, when thy sins call for it, can fence a Curse.
Thou shall not lose one mite. Though waters stray,
The Bread we cast returns in fraughts one day.
Spend not an hour so, as to weep another,
For tears are not thine own; If thou giv'st words
Dash not thy friend, nor Heaven; O smother
A vip'rous thought; some Syllables are Swords.
Unbitted tongues are in their penance double,
They shame their owners, and the hearers trouble.
Injure not modest blood, whose spirits rise
In judgment against Lewdness; that is base wit
That voyds but filth, and stench. Have thou no prize
But sickness, or Infection? stiflle it.
Who makes his jests of sins, must be at least
If not a very devil, worse than a Beast.
Yet, fly no friend, if he be such indeed,
But meet to quench his Longings, and thy Thirst;
Allow your Joys Religion; That done, speed
And bring the same man back, thou were all first.
Who so returns not, cannot pray aright,
But shuts his door, and leaves God out all night.
To highten thy Devotions, and keep low
All mutinous thoughts, what business ever thou have
Observe God in his works; here fountains flow,
Birds sing, Beasts feed, Fish leap, and the Earth stands fast;
Above are restles motions, running Lights,
Vast Circling Azure, giddy Clouds, days, nights,
When Seasons change, then lay before thine Eyes
His wondrous Method; mark the various Scenes
In heaven; Hail, Thunder, Rain-bows, Snow, and Ice,
Calmes, Tempests, Light, and darkness by his means;
Thou can not miss his Praise; Each tree, herb, flower
Are shadows of his wisdom, and his Power.
To meals when thou do come, give him the praise
Whose Arm supplied thee; Take what may suffice,
And then be thankful; O admire his ways
Who fills the worlds unempty'd granaries!
A thankles feeder is a Theif, his feast
A very Robbery, and himself no guest.
High-noon thus past, thy time decays; provide
Thee other thoughts; Away with friends, and mirth;
The Sun now stoops, and hasts his beams to hide
Under the dark, and melancholy Earth.
All but preludes thy End. Thou art the man
Whose Rise, hight, and Descent is but a span.
Yet, set as he does, and it is well. Have all
Thy Beams home with thee: trim thy Lamp, buy Oil,
And then set forth; who is thus dressed, The Fall
Furthers his glory, and gives death the foyl.
Man is a Summers day; whose youth, and fire
Cool to a glorious Evening, and Expire.
When night comes, list thy deeds; make plain the way
'Twixt Heaven, and thee; block it not with delays,
But perfect all before thou sleep'st; Then say
There Is one Sun more strung on my Bead of days.
What Is good score up for Joy; The bad well scanned
Wash off with tears, and get thy Masters hand.
Thy Accounts thus made, spend in the grave one hour
Before thy time; Be not a stranger there
Where thou may sleep whole ages; Life's poor flowr
Lasts not a night sometimes. Bad spirits fear
This Coversation; But the good man lies
Intombed many days before he dies.
Being laid, and dressed for sleep, Close not thy Eyes
Up with thy Curtains; Give thy soul the wing
In some good thoughts; So when the day shall rise
And thou unrak'st thy fire, those sparks will bring
New flames; Besides where these lodge vain heats mourn
And die; That Bush where God is, shall not burn.
When thy Nap's over, stir thy fire, unrake
In that dead age; one beam in the dark outvies
Two in the day; Then from the Damps, and Ache
Of night shut up thy leaves, be Chaste; God prys
Through thickest nights; Though then the Sun be far
Do thou the works of Day, and rise a Star.
Briefly, Do as thou would be done unto,
Love God, and Love thy Neighbor; Watch, and Pray.
These are the Words, and Works of life; This do,
And live; who does not thus, has lost Heavens way.
O lose it not! look up, wilt Change those Lights
For Chains of Darkness, and Eternal Nights?
Corruption.
SUre, It was so. Man in those early days
Was not all stone, and Earth,
He shined a little, and by those weak Rays
Had some glimpse of his birth.
He saw Heaven o'r his head, and knew from whence
He came (condemned,) hither,
And, as first Love draws strongest, so from hence
His mind sure progress'd thither.
Things here were strange unto him: Swet, and till
All was a thorn, or weed,
Nor did those last, but (like himself,) dyed still
As soon as they did Seed,
They seemed to quarrel with him; for that Act
That fell him, foiled them all,
He drew the Curse upon the world, and Cracked
The whole frame with his fall.
This made him long for home, as loath to stay
With murmurers, and foes;
He sighed for Eden, and would often say
Ah! what bright days were those?
Nor was Heaven cold unto him; for each day
The valley, or the Mountain
Afforded visits, and still Paradise lay
In some green shade, or fountain.
Angels lay Leiger here; Each Bush, and Cel,
Each Oak, and highway knew them,
Walk but the fields, or sit down at some will,
And he was sure to view them.
Almighty Love! where art thou now? mad man
Sits down, and freezeth on,
He raves, and swears to stir nor fire, nor fan,
But bids the thread be spun.
I see, thy Curtains are Close-drawn; Thy bow
Looks dim too in the Cloud,
Sin triumphs still, and man is sunk below
The Center, and his shroud;
All Is in deep sleep, and night; Thick darkness lies
And hatcheth o'r thy people;
But hark! what trumpets that? what Angel cries
Arise! Thrust in thy sickle.
H. Scriptures.
WElcome dear book, souls Joy, and food! The feast
Of Spirits, Heaven extracted lies in thee;
Thou art life's Charter, The Doves spotless neast
Where souls are hatched unto Eternity.
In thee the hidden stone, the Manna lies,
Thou art the great Elixir, rare, and Choice;
The Key that opens to all Mysteries,
The Word in Characters, God in the Voice.
O that I had deep Cut in my hard heart
Each line in thee! Then would I plead in groans
Of my Lords penning, and by sweetest Art
Return upon himself the Law, and Stones.
Read here, my faults are thine. This Book, and I
Will tell thee so; Sweet Savior thou did dye!
Unprofitablenes.
HOw rich, O Lord! how fresh thy visits are!
'Twas but Just now my bleak leaves hopeless hung
Sullyed with dust and mud;
Each snarling blast shot through me, and did share
Their Youth, and beauty, Cold showers nipt, and wrung
Their spiciness, and blood;
But since thou did in one sweet glance survey
Their sad decays, I flourish, and once more
Breath all perfumes, and spice;
I smell a dew like Myrrh, and all the day
Wear in my bosom a full Sun; such store
Has one beam from thy Eyes.
But, ah, my God! what fruit have thou of this?
What one poor leaf did ever I yet fall
To wait upon thy wreath?
Thus thou all day a thankless weed do dress,
And when the have done, a stench, or fog is all
The odor I bequeath.
CHRIST'S Nativity.
AWake, glad heart! get up, and Sing,
It is the Birthday of thy King,
Awake! awake!
The Sun does shake
Light from his locks, and all the way
Breathing Perfumes, does spice the day.
2.
Awak, awak! hark, how the wood rings,
Winds whisper, and the busy springs
A Consort make;
A wake, awake!
Man is their high priest, and should rise
To offer up the sacrifice.
3.
I would I were some Bird, or Star,
Fluttering in woods, or lifted far
Above this Inn
And Rode of sin!
Then either Star, or Bird, should be
Shining, or singing still to thee.
4.
I would I had in my best part
Fit Rooms for thee! or that my heart
Were so clean as
Thy manger was!
But I am all filth, and obscene,
Yet, if thou will, thou can make clean.
5.
Sweet Jesu! will then; Let no more
This Leper haunt, and soil thy door,
Cure him, Ease him
O release him!
And let once more by mystic birth
The Lord of life be borne in Earth.
II.
HOw kind is heaven to man! If here
One sinner does amend
Strait there is Joy, and every sphere
In music does Contend;
And shall we then no voices lift?
Are mercy, and salvation
Not worth our thanks? Is life a gift
Of no more acceptance?
Shall he that did come down from thence,
And here for us was slain,
Shall he be now cast off? no sense
Of all his woes remain?
Can neither Love, nor sufferings bind?
Are we all stone, and Earth?
Neither his bloody passions mind,
Nor one day bless his birth?
Alas, my God! Thy birth now here
Must not be numbered in the year.
The Check.
PEace, peace! I blush to hear thee; when thou art
A dusty story
A speechless heap, and in the midst my heart
In the same livery dressed
Lies tame as all the rest;
When six years thence dug up, some youthful Eye
Seeks there for Symmetry
But finding none, shall leave thee to the wind,
Or the next foot to Crush,
Scattering thy kind
And humble dust, tell then dear flesh
Where is thy glory?
2.
As he that in the midst of day Expects
The hideous night,
Sleeps not, but shaking off sloth, and neglects,
Works with the Sun, and sets
Paying the day its debts;
That (for Repose, and darkness bound,) he might
Rest from the fears in the night;
So should we too. All things teach us to die
And point us out the way
While we pass by
And mind it not; play not away
Thy glimpse of light.
3.
View thy forerunners: Creatures given to be
Thy youths Companions,
Take their leave, and die; Birds, beasts, each tree
All that have growth, or breath
Have one large language, Death.
O then play not! but strive to him, who Can
Make these sad shades pure Sun,
Turning their mists to beams, their damps to day,
Whose power does so excel
As to make Clay
A spirit, and true glory dwell
In dust, and stones.
4.
Hark, how he does Invite thee! with what voice
Of Love, and sorrow
He begs, and Calls; O that in these thy days
Thou knew'st but thy own good!
Shall not the Cries of blood,
Of Gods own blood awake thet? He bids beware
Of drunknes, surfeits, Care,
But thou sleep'st on; where is now thy protestation,
Thy Lines, thy Love? Away,
Redeem the day,
The day that gives no observation,
Perhaps to morrow.
Disorder and frailty.
WHen first thou did even from the grave
And womb of darkness becken out
My brutish soul, and to thy slave
Becam'st thy self, both guide, and Scout;
Even from that hour
Thou gotst my heart; And though here tossed
By winds, and bit with frost
I pine, and shrink
Breaking the link
'Twixt thee, and me; And oftimes creep
Into the old silence, and dead sleep,
Quitting thy way
All the long day,
Yet, sure, my God! I love thee most.
Alas, thy love!
2.
I threaten heaven, and from my Cell
Of Clay, and frailty break, and bud
Touched by thy fire, and breath; Thy blood
Too, is my Dew, and springing well.
But while I grow
And stretch to thee, aiming at all
Thy stars, and spangled hall,
Each fly does taste
Poison, and blast
My yielding leaves; sometimes a shower
Beats them quite off, and in an hour
Not one poor shoot
But the bare root
Hid under ground survives the fall.
Alas, frail weed!
3.
Thus like some sleeping Exhalation
(Which waked by heat, and beams, makes up
Unto that Comforter, the Sun,
And soars, and shines; But ever we sup
And walk two steps
Cooled by the damps of night, descends,
And, whence it sprung, there ends,)
Does my weak fire
Pine, and retire,
And (after all my hight of flames,)
In sickly Expirations tames
Leaving me dead
On my first bed
Until thy Sun again ascends.
Poor, falling Star!
4.
O, is! but give wings to my fire,
And hatch my soul, until it fly
Up where thou art, amongst thy tire
Of Stars, above Infirmity;
Let not perverse,
And foolish thoughts add to my Bil
Of forward sins, and Kill
That seed, which thou
In me did sow,
But dress, and water with thy grace
Together with the seed, the place;
And for his sake
Who died to stake
His life for mine, tune to thy will
My heart, my verse.
Hosea Cap. 6. ver. 4. O Ephraim what shall I do unto thee? O Judah how shall I
entreat thee? for thy goodness is as a morning Cloud, and as the early Dew it
goes away.


Idle Verse.
GO, go, queint folies, sugared sin,
Shadow no more my door;
I will no longer Cobwebs spin,
I Am too much on the score.
For since amidst my youth, and night,
My great preserver smiles,
We Will make a Match, my only light,
And Join against their wiles;
Blind, desperate fits, that study how
To dress, and trim our shame,
That gild rank poison, and allow
Vice in a fairer name;
The Purles of youthful blood, and bowls,
Lust in the Robes of Love,
The idle talk of feav'rish souls
Sick with a scarf, or glove;
Let it suffice my warmer days
Simper'd, and shined on you,
Twist not my Cypress with your Bays,
Or Roses with my Yewgh;
Go, go, seek out some greener thing,
It snows, and freezeth here;
Let Nightingales attend the spring,
Winter is all my year.
Son-dayes.
BRight shadows of true Rest! some shoots of bliss,
Heaven once a week;
The next worlds gladness prepossest in this;
A day to seek;
Eternity in time; the steps by which
We Climb above all ages; Lamps that light
Man through his heap of dark days; and the rich,
And full redemption of the whole weeks flight.
2.
The Pulleys unto headlong man; times bower;
The narrow way;
Transplanted Paradise; Gods walking hour;
The Cool of the day;
The Creatures Jubilee; Gods parle with dust;
Heaven here; Man on those hills of Myrrh, and flowers
Angels descending; the Returns of Trust;
A Gleam of glory, after six-days-showres.
3.
The Churches love feasts; Times Prerogative,
And Interest
Deducted from the whole; The Combs, and hive,
And home of rest.
The milky way Chalkt out with Suns; a Clue
That guides through erring hours; and in full story
A taste of Heaven on earth; the pledge, and Cue
Of a full feast; And the Out Courts of glory.
Repentance.
LOrd, since thou did in this vile Clay
That sacred Ray
Thy spirit plant, quickening the whole
With that one grains Infused wealth,
My forward flest creept on, and subtly stole
Both growth, and power; Checking the health
And heat of thine: That little gate
And narrow way, by which to thee
The Passage is, He termed a grate
And Entrance to Captivity;
Thy laws but nets, where some small birds
(And those but seldom too) were caught,
Thy Promises but empty words
Which none but Children heard, or taught.
This I believed: And though a friend
Came often from far, and whispered, No;
Yet that not sorting to my end
I wholly listened to my foe.
Wherefore, pierced through with grief, my sad
Seduced soul sighs up to thee,
To thee who with true light art Clad
And see all things just as they be.
Look from thy throne upon this Roll
Of heavy sins, my high transgressions,
Which I Confess withal my soul,
My God, Accept of my Confession.
It was last day
(Touched with the guilt of my own way)
I sat alone, and taking up
The bitter Cup,
Through all thy fair, and various store
Sought out what might outvie my score.
The blades of grass, thy Creatures feeding,
The trees, their leafs; the flowers, their seeding;
The Dust, of which I am a part,
The Stones much softer than my heart,
The drops of rain, the sighs of wind,
The Stars to which I am stark blind,
The Dew thy herbs drink up by night,
The beams they warm them at l'th' light,
All that have signature or life,
I summoned to decide this strife,
And lest I should lack for Arrears,
A spring ran by, I told her tears,
But when these came unto the scale,
My sins alone outweigh'd them all.
O my dear God! my life, my love!
Most blessed lamb! and mildest dove!
Forgive your penitent Offender,
And no more his sins remember,
Scatter these shades of death, and give
Light to my soul, that it may live;
Cut me not off for my transgressions,
Wilful rebellions, and suppressions,
But give them in those streams a part
Whose spring is in my Saviors heart.
Lord, I confess the heinous score,
And pray, I may do so no more,
Though then all sinners I exceed
O think on this; Thy Son did bleed;
O call to mind his wounds, his woes,
His Agony, and bloody throws;
Then look on all that thou have made,
And mark how they do fail, and fade,
The heavens themselves, though fair and bright
Are dark, and unclean in thy sight,
How then, with thee, Can man be holy
Who do thine Angels charge with folly?
O what am I, that I should breed
Figs on a thorn, flowers on a weed!
I am the gourd of sin, and sorrow
Growing o'r night, and gone to morrow,
In all this Round of life and death
Nothing's more vile than is my breath,
Profanenes on my tongue does rest,
Defects, and darkness in my breast,
Pollutions all my body wed,
And even my soul to thee is dead,
Only in him, on whom I feast,
Both soul, and body are well dressed,
His pure perfection quits all score,
And fills the Boxes of his poor;
He is the Center of long life, and light,
I am but finite, He is Infinite.
O let thy Justice then in him Confine,
And through his merits, make thy mercy mine!
The BURIAL Of an Infant.
Blessed Infant Bud, whose Blossome-life
Did only look about, and fall,
Wearyed out in a harmles strife
Of tears, and milk, the food of all;
Sweetly did thou expire: Thy soul
Flew home unstained by his new kin,
For ere thou knew'st how to be foul,
Death weaned thee from the world, and sin.
Softly rest all thy Virgin-Crums!
Lapt in the sweets of thy young breath,
Expecting till thy Savior Comes
To dress them, and unswadle death.
Faith.
BRight, and blessed beam! whose strong projection
Equal to all,
Reaches as well things of dejection
As the high, and tall;
How has my God by raying thee
Enlarged his spouse,
And of a private family
Made open house?
All may be now Coheirs; no noise
Of Bond, or Free
Can Interdict us from those Joys
That wait on thee,
The Law, and Ceremonies made
A glorious night,
Where Stars, and Clouds, both light, and shade
Had equal right;
But, as in nature, when the day
Breaks, night adjourns,
Stars shut up shop, mists pack away,
And the Moon mourns;
So when the Sun of righteousness
Did once appear,
That Scene was changed, and a new dress
Left for us here;
Veiles became useles, Altars fell,
Fires smoking die;
And all that sacred pomp, and shel
Of things did fly;
Then did he shine forth, whose sad fall,
And bitter fights
Were figured in those mystical,
And Cloudie Rites;
And as in the natural Sun, these three,
Light, motion, heat,
So are now Faith, Hope, Charity
Through him Complete;
Faith spans up bliss; what sin, and death
Put us quite from,
Lest we should run for it out of breath,
Faith bring us home;
So that I need no more, but say
I do believe,
And my most loving Lord straitway does answer, Live.
The Dawning.
AH! what time will thou come? when shall that cry
The Bridegroome's Coming! fill the sky?
Shall it in the Evening run
When our words and works are done?
Or will thy all-surprizing light
Break at midnight?
When either sleep, or some dark pleasure
Possesses mad man without measure;
Or shall these early, fragrant hours
Unlock thy bowres?
And with their blush of light descry
Thy locks crowned with eternity;
Indeed, it is the only time
That with thy glory does best chime,
All now are stirring, every field
Full hymns does yield,
The whole Creation shakes off night,
And for thy shadow looks the light,
Stars now vanish without number,
Sleepie Planets set, and slumber,
The pursie Clouds disband, and scatter,
All expect some sudden matter,
Not one beam triumphs, but from far
That morning star;
O at what time soever thou
(Unknown to us,) the heavens wilt bow,
And, with thy Angels in the Van,
Descend to Judge poor careless man,
Grant, I may not like puddle lie
In a Corrupt security,
Where, if a traveller water crave,
He finds it dead, and in a grave;
But as this restless, vocal Spring
All day, and night does run, and sing,
And though here born, yet is acquainted
Elsewhere, and flowing keeps untainted;
So let me all my busy age
In thy free services engage,
And though (while here) of force I must
Have Commerce sometimes with poor dust,
And in my flesh, though vile, and low,
As this does in her Channel, flow,
Yet let my Course, my aim, my Love,
And chief acquaintance be above;
So when that day, and hour shall come
In which thy self will be the Sun,
Thou Wilt find me dressed and on my way,
Watching the Break of thy great day.
Admission.
HOw shril are silent tears? when sin got head
And all my Bowels turned
To brass, and iron; when my stock lay dead,
And all my powers mourned;
Then did these drops (for Marble sweats,
And Rocks have tears,)
As rain here at our windows beats,
Chide in thine Ears;
2.
No quiet could thou have: nor did thou wink,
And let thy Beggar lie,
But ever my eyes could overflow their brink
Did to each drop reply;
Bowels of Love! at what low rate,
And slight a price
Do thou relieve us at thy gate,
And still our Cries?
3.
We are thy Infants, and suck thee; If thou
But hide, or turn thy face,
Because where thou art, yet, we cannot go,
We send tears to the place,
These find thee out, and though our sins
Drove thee away,
Yet with thy love that absence wins
Us double pay.
4.
O give me then a thankful heart! a heart
After thy own, not mine;
So after thine, that all, and every part
Of mine, may wait on thine;
O hear! yet not my tears alone,
Hear now a flood,
A flood that drowns both tears, and groans,
My Saviors blood.
Praise.
KIng of Comforts! King of life!
Thou have cheered me,
And when fears, and doubts were rife,
Thou have cleared me!
Not a nook in all my Breast
But thou fill'st it,
Not a thought, that breaks my rest,
But thou kill'st it;
Wherefore with my utmost strength
I will praise thee,
And as thou giv'st line, and length,
I will raise thee;
Day, and night, not once a day
I will bless thee,
And my soul in new array
I will dress thee;
Not one minute in the year
But I Will mind thee,
As my seal, and bracelet here
I will bind thee;
In thy word, as if in heaven
I will rest me,
And thy promise 'til made even
There shall feast me.
Then, thy sayings all my life
They shall please me,
And thy bloody wounds, and strife
They will ease me;
With thy groans my daily breath
I will measure,
And my life hid in thy death
I will treasure.
Though then thou art
Past thought of heart
All perfect fullness,
And can no whit
Access admit
From dust and dullness;
Yet to thy name
(as not the same
With thy bright Essence,)
Our foul, Clay hands
At thy Commands
Bring praise, and Incense;
If then, dread Lord,
When to thy board
Thy wretch comes begging,
He has a flower
Or (to his power,)
Some such poor Offering;
When thou have made
Thy beggar glad,
And filled his bosom,
Let him (though poor,)
Strew at thy door
That one poor Blossom.
Dressing.
O Thou that love a pure, and whitend soul!
That feedst among the Lillies, 'till the day
Break, and the shadows flee* touch with one Coal
My frozen heart; and with thy secret key
Open my desolate rooms; my gloomie Breast
With thy clear fire refine, burning to dust
These dark Confusions, that within me nest,
And soil thy Temple with a sinful rust.
Thou holy, harmless, undefiled high priest!
The perfect, full oblation for all sin,
Whose glorious conquest nothing can resist,
But even in babes do triumph still and win;
Give to thy wretched one
Thy mystical Communion,
That, absent, he may see,
Live, die, and rise with thee;
Let him so follow here, that in the end
He may take thee, as thou do him intend.
Give him thy private seal,
Earnest, and sign; Thy gifts so deal
That these forerunners here
May make the future clear;
Whatever thou do bid, let faith make good,
Bread for thy body, and Wine for thy blood.
Give him (with pity) love,
Two flowers that grew with thee above;
Love that shall not admit
Anger for one short fit,
And pity of such a divine extent
That may thy members, more than mine, resent.
Give me, my God! thy grace,
The beams, and brightness of thy face,
That never like a beast
I take thy sacred feast,
Or the dread mysteries of thy blessed blood
Use, with like Custom, as my Kitchen food*
Some sit to thee, and eat
Thy body as their Common meat,
O let not me do so!
Poor dust should ly still low,
Then kneel my soul, and body; kneel, and bow;
If Saints, and Angels fall down, much more thou.
Easter Day.
THou, whose sad heart, and weeping head lies low,
Whose Cloudy breast cold damps invade,
Who never feel'st the Sun, nor smooth'st thy brow,
But sitt'st oppressed in the shade,
Awake, awake,
And in his Resurrection partake,
Who on this day (that thou might rise as he,)
Rose up, and cancelled two deaths due to thee.
Awake, awake; and, like the Sun, disperse
All mists that would usurp this day;
Where are thy Palms, thy branches, and thy verse?
Hosanna! hark; why do thou stay?
Arise, arise,
And with his healing blood anoint thine Eyes,
Thy inward Eyes; his blood will cure thy mind,
Whose spittle only could restore the blind.
Easter Hymn.
DEath, and darkness get you packing,
Nothing now to man is lacking,
All your triumphs now are ended,
And what Adam marred, is mended;
Graves are beds now for the weary,
Death a nap, to wake more merry;
Youth now, full of pious duty,
Seeks in thee for perfect beauty,
The weak, and aged tired, with length
Of days, from thee look for new strength,
And Infants with thy pangs Contest
As pleasant, as if with the breast;
Then, unto him, who thus has thrown
Even to Contempt thy kingdom down,
And by his blood did us advance
Unto his own Inheritance,
To him be glory, power, praise,
From this, unto the last of days.
The Holy Communion.
WElcome sweet, and sacred feast; welcome life!
Dead I was, and deep in trouble;
But grace, and blessings came with thee so rife,
That they have quickened even dry stubble;
Thus souls their bodies animate,
And thus, at first, when things were rude,
Dark, void, and Crude
They, by thy Word, their beauty had, and date;
All were by thee,
And still must be,
Nothing that is, or lives,
But has his Quicknings, and reprieves
As thy hand opes, or shuts;
Healings, and Cuts,
Darkness, and daylight, life, and death
Are but mere leaves turned by thy breath.
Spirits without thee die,
And blackness sits
On the divinest wits,
As on the Sun Ecclipses lie.
But that great darkness at thy death
When the veyl broke with thy last breath,
Did make us see
The way to thee;
And now by these sure, sacred ties,
After thy blood
(Our sov'rain good,)
Had cleared our eyes,
And given us sight;
Thou do unto thy self betroth
Our souls, and bodies both
In everlasting light.
Was It not enough that thou had paid the price
And given us eyes
When we had none, but thou must also take
Us by the hand
And keep us still awake,
When we would sleep,
Or from thee creep,
Who without thee cannot stand?
Was It not enough to lose thy breath
And blood by an accursed death,
But thou must also leave
To us that did bereave
Thee of them both, these seals the means
That should both cleanse
And keep us so,
Who wrought thy woe?
O rose of Sharon! O the Lilly
Of the valley!
How art thou now, thy flock to keep,
Become both food, and Shepherd to thy sheep!
Psalm 121.
UP to those bright, and gladsome hills
Whence flows my weal, and mirth,
I look, and sigh for him, who fills
(Unseen,) both heaven, and earth.
He is alone my help, and hope,
that I shall not be moved,
His watchful Eye is ever open,
And guardeth his beloved;
The glorious God is my sole stay,
He is my Sun, and shade,
The cold by night, the heat by day,
Neither shall me invade.
He keeps me from the spite of foes,
Does all their plots control,
And is a shield (not reckoning those,)
Unto my very soul.
Whether abroad, amidst the Crowd,
Or else within my door,
He is my Pillar, and my Cloud,
Now, and for evermore.
Affliction.
PEace, peace; It is not so. Thou do miscall
Thy Physic; Pills that change
Thy sick Accessions into settled health,
This is the great Elixir that turns gall
To wine, and sweetness; Poverty to wealth,
And brings man home, when he does range.
Did not he, who ordained the day,
Ordain night too?
And in the greater world display
What in the lesser he would do?
All flesh is Clay, thou know; and but that God
Does use his rod,
And by a fruitful Change of frosts, and showers
Cherish, and bind thy powers,
Thou would to weeds, and thistles quite disperse,
And be more wild than is thy verse;
Sickness is wholesome, and Crosses are but curbs
To check the mule, unruly man,
They are heavens husbandry, the famous fan
Purging the floor which Chaff disturbs.
Were all the year one constant Sunshine, we
should have no flowers,
All would be drought, and leanness; not a tree
would make us bowres;
Beauty consists in colors; and that is best
Which is not fixed, but flies, and flows
The settled Red is dull, and whites that rest
Something of sickness would disclose.
Vicissitude plays all the game,
nothing that stirrs,
Or has a name,
But waits upon this wheel,
Kingdoms too have their Physic, and for steel,
Exchange their peace, and furrs.
Thus does God Key disordered man
(which none else can,)
Tuning his breast to rise, or fall;
And by a sacred, needful art
Like strings, stretch every part
Making the whole most Musical.
The Tempest.
HOw is man parcell'd out? how every hour
Shows him himself, or something he should see?
This late, long hea^ may his Instruction be,
And tempests have more in them than a shower.
When nature on her bosom saw
Her Infants die,
And all her flowers withered to straw,
Her breasts grown dry;
She made the Earth their nurse, and tomb,
Sigh to the sky,
'Til to those sighs fetched from her womb
Rain did reply,
So in the midst of all her scars
And faint requests
Her Earnest sighs procured her tears
And filled her breasts.
O that man could do so! that he would hear
The world read to him! all the vast expense
In the Creation shed, and slav'd to sense
Makes up but lectures for his eye, and ear.
Sure, mighty love foreseeing the descent
Of this poor Creature, by a gracious art
Hid in these low things snares to gain his heart,
And laid surprises in each Element.
All things here show him heaven; waters that fall
Chide, and fly up; Mists of corruptest some
Quit their first beds and mount; trees, herbs, flowers, all
Strive upwards still, and point him the way home.
How do they cast off grossness? only Earth,
And Man (like Issachar) in lodes delight,
Water's refined to Motion, Air to Light,
Fire to all Light, Motion, heat.
three, but man has no such mirth.
Plants in the root with Earth do most Comply,
Their Leafs with water, and humiditie,
The Flowers to air draw near, and subtlety,
And seeds a kindred fire have with the sky.
All have their keys, and set ascents; but man
Though he knows these, and has more of his own,
Sleeps at the ladders foot; alas! what can
These new discoveries do, except they drown?
Thus grovelling in the shade, and darkness, he
Sinks to a dead oblivion; and though all
He sees, (like Pyramids,) shoot from this ball
And lessening still grow up invisibly,
Yet hugs he still his dirt; The stuff he wears
And painted trimming take down both his eyes,
Heaven has less beauty than the dust he spies,
And money better music than the Spheres.
Life's but a blast, he knows it; what? shall straw,
And bul-rush-fetters temper his short hour?
Must he nor sip, nor sing? grows never a flowr
To crown his temples? shall dreams be his law?
O foolish man! how have thou lost thy sight?
How is it that the Sun to thee alone
Is grown thick darkness, and thy bread, a stone?
Has flesh no softness now? midday no light?
Lord! thou did put a soul here; If I must
Be broke again, for flints will give no fire
Without a steel, O let thy power clear
Thy gift once more, and grind this flint to dust!
Retirement.
WHo on yon throne of Azure sits,
Keeping close house
Above the morning-starre,
Whose meaner shows,
And outward utensils these glories are
That shine and share
Part of his mansion; He one day
When I went quite astray
Out of mere love
By his mild Dove
Did show me home, and put me in the way.
2.
Let it suffice at length thy fits
And lusts (said he,)
Have had their wish, and way;
Press not to be
Still thy own foe, and mine; for to this day
I did delay,
And would not see, but chose to wink,
Nay, at the very brink
And edge of all
When thou would fall
My love-twist held thee up, my unseen link.
3.
I know thee well; for I have framed
And hate thee not,
Thy spirit too is mine;
I know thy lot,
Extent, and end, for my hands drew the line
Assigned thine;
If then thou would unto my seat,
It Is not the applause, and feat
Of dust, and clay
Leads to that way,
But from those follies a resolved Retreat.
4.
Now here below where yet untamed
Thou do thus rove
I have a house as well
As there above,
In it my Name, and honor both do dwell
And shall until
I make all new; there nothing gay
In perfumes, or Array,
Dust lies with dust
And has but just
The same Respect, and room, with every clay.
5.
A faithful school where thou may see
In Heraldrie
Of stones, and speechless Earth
Thy true descent;
Where dead men preach, who can turn feasts, and mirth
To funerals, and Lent.
There dust that out of doors might fill
Thy eyes, and blind thee still,
Is fast asleep;
Up then, and keep
Within those doors, (my doors) do hear? I will.
Love, and Discipline.
SInce in a land not barren still
(Because thou do thy grace distill,)
My lot is fallen, Blessed be thy will!
And since these biting frosts but kill
Some tares in me which choke, or spil
That seed thou sow'st, Blessed be thy skill!
Blessed be thy Dew, and blessed thy frost,
And happy I to be so crossed,
And cured by Crosses at thy cost.
The Dew does Cheer what is distressed,
The frosts ill weeds nip, and molest,
In both thou work'st unto the best.
Thus while thy several mercies plot,
And work on me now cold, now hot,
The work goes on, and slacketh not,
For as thy hand the weather steers,
So thrive I best, 'twixt joys, and tears,
And all the year have some grean Ears.
The Pilgrimage.
AS travellours when the twilight's come,
And in the sky the stars appear,
The past days accidents do sum
With, Thus we saw there, and thus here.
Then Jacob-like lodge in a place
(A place, and no more, is set down,)
Where till the day restore the race
They rest and dream homes of their own.
So for this night I linger here,
And full of tossings too and fro,
Expect still when thou will appear
That I may get me up, and go.
I long, and groan, and grieve for thee,
For thee my words, my tears do gush,
O that I were but where I see!
Is all the note within my Bush.
As Birds robbed of their native wood,
Although their Diet may be fine,
Yet neither sing, nor like their food,
But with the thought of home do pine;
So do I mourn, and hang my head,
And though thou do me fullnes give,
Yet look I for far better bread
Because by this man cannot live.
O feed me then! and since I may
Have yet more days, more nights to Count,
So strengthen me, Lord, all the way,
That I may travel to thy Mount.
Heb. Cap. xi. ver. 13. And they Confessed, thus they were strangers, and
Pilgrims on the earth.


The Law, and the Gospel.
LOrd, when thou did on Sinai pitch
And shine from Paran, when a fiery Law
Pronounced with thunder, and thy threats did thaw
Thy Peoples hearts, when all thy weeds were rich
And Inaccessible for light,
Terror, and might,
How did poor flesh (which after thou did wear,)
Then faint, and fear!
Thy Chosen flock, like leafs in a high wind,
Whispered obedience, and their heads Inclined.
2.
But now since we to Sion came,
And through thy blood thy glory see,
With filial Confidence we touch even thee;
And where the other mount all clad in flame,
And threatening Clouds would not so much
As 'bide the touch,
We Climb up this, and have too all the way
Thy hand our stay,
Nay, thou take ours, and (which full Comfort brings)
Thy Dove too bears us on her sacred wings.
3.
Yet since man is a very brute
And after all thy Acts of grace does kick,
Slighting that health thou gav'st, when he was sick,
Be not displeased, If I, who have a suit
To thee each hour, beg at thy door
For this one more;
O plant in me thy Gospel, and thy Law,
Both Faith, and Awe;
So twist them in my heart, that ever there
I may as well as Love, find too thy fear!
4.
Let me not spil, but drink thy blood,
Not break thy fence, and by a black Excess
Force down a Just Curse, when thy hands would bless;
Let me not scatter, and despise my food,
Or nail those blessed limbs again
Which bore my pain;
So Shall thy mercies flow: for while I fear,
I know, thou wilt bear,
But should thy mild Injunction nothing move me,
I would both think, and Judge I did not love thee.
John Cap. 14. ver. 15. If ye love me, keep my Commandments.


The World.
I Saw Eternity the other night
Like a great Ring of pure and endless light,
All calm, as it was bright,
And round beneath it, Time in hours, days, years
Driven by the spheres
Like a vast shadow moved, In which the world
And all her train were hurled;
The doting Lover in his queintest strain
Did their Complain,
Near him, his Lute, his fancy, and his flights,
Wits so our delights,
With gloves, and knots the silly snares of pleasure
Yet his dear Treasure
All scattered lay, while he his eyes did pour
Upon a flowr.
2.
The darksome Statesman hung with weights and woe
Like a thick midnight-fog moved there so slow
He did nor stay, nor go;
Condemning thoughts (like sad Ecclipses) scowl
Upon his soul,
And Clouds of crying witnesses without
Pursued him with one shout.
Yet dig'd the Mole, and lest his ways be found
Workt under ground,
Where he did Clutch his prey, but one did see
That policy,
Churches and altars fed him, Perjuries
Were gnats and flies,
It rained about him blood and tears, but he
Drank them as free.
3.
The fearful miser on a heap of rust
Sat pining all his life there, did scarce trust
His own hands with the dust,
Yet would not place one piece above, but lives
In fear of thieves.
Thousands there were as frantic as himself
And hug 'd each one his pelf,
The downright Epicure placed heaven in sense
And scornd pretense
While others slipped into a wide Excess
Said little less;
The weaker sort slight, trivial wares Inslave
Who think them brave,
And poor, despised truth sat Counting by
Their victory.
4.
Yet some, who all this while did weep and sing,
And sing, and weep, soared up into the Ring,
But most would use no wing.
O fools (said I,) thus to prefer dark night
Before true light,
To live in grots, and caves, and hate the day
Because it shows the way,
The way which from this dead and dark abode
Leads up to God,
A way where you might tread the Sun, and be
More bright than he.
But as I did their madness so discuss
One whispered thus,
This Ring the Bridegroom did for none provide
But for his bride.
John Cap. 2. ver. 16, 17. All that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the
lust of the Eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the father, but is of the
world.

And the world passes away, and the lusts thereof, but he that does the will
of God abides for ever.


The Mutiny.
WEary of this same Clay, and straw, I laid
Me down to breath, and casting in my heart
The after-burthens, and griefs yet to come,
The heavy sum
So shook my breast, that (sick and sore dismayed)
My thoughts, like water which some stone does start
Did quit their troubled Channel, and retire
Unto the banks, where* storming at those bounds,
They murmured sore; But I, who felt them boil
And knew their Coyl,
Turning to him, who made poor sand to tire
And tame proud waves, If yet these barren grounds
And thirsty brick must be (said I)
My task, and Destiny,
2.
Let me so strive and struggle with thy foes
(Not thine alone, but mine too,) that when all
Their Arts and force are built unto the height
That Babel-weight
May prove thy glory, and their shame; so Close
And knit me to thee, That though in this vale
Of sin, and death I sojourn, yet one Eye
May look to thee, To thee the finisher
And Author of my faith; so show me home
That all this foam
And frothie noise which up and down does fly
May find no lodging in mine Eye, or Ear,
O seal them up! that these may fly
Like other tempests by.
3.
Not but I know thou have a shorter Cut
To bring me home, than through a wilderness,
A Sea, or Sands and Serpents; Yet since thou
(As thy words show)
Though in this desert I were wholly shut,
Can light and lead me there with such redress
That no decay shall touch me; O be pleased
To fix my steps, and whatsoever path
Thy sacred and eternal will decreed
For thy bruised reed
O give it full obedience, that so seized
Of all I have, I may nor move thy wrath
Nor grieve thy Dove, but soft and mild
Both live and die thy Child.
Revel. Cap. 2. ver. 17. To him that overcomes will I give to eat of the
hidden Manna, and I will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name
written, which no man knows, saving he that receives it.


The Constellation.
FAir, ordered lights (whose motion without noise
Resembles those true Joys
Whose spring is on that hill where you do grow
And we here taste sometimes below,)
With what exact obedience do you move
Now beneath, and now above,
And in your vast progressions overlook
The darkest night, and closest nook!
Some nights I see you in the gladsome East,
Some others near the West,
And when I cannot see, yet do you shine
And beat about your endless line.
Silence, and light, and watchfulnes with you
Attend and wind the Clue,
No sleep, nor sloth assailes you, but poor man
Still either sleeps, or slips his span.
He grops beneath here, and with restless Care
First makes, then hugs a snare,
Adores dead dust, sets heart on Corn and grass
But seldom does make heaven his glass.
Music and mirth (if there be music here)
Take up, and tune his year,
These things are Kin to him, and must be had,
Who kneels, or sighs a life is mad.
Perhaps some nights he will watch with you, and peep
When it were best to sleep,
Dares know Effects, and Judge them long before,
When the herb he treads knows much, much more.
But seeks he your Obedience, Order, Light,
Your calm and wel-train'd flight,
Where, though the glory differ in each star,
Yet is there peace still, and no war?
Since placed by him who calls you by your names
And fixed there all your flames,
Without Command you never acted ought
And then you in your Courses fought.
But here Commissioned by a black self-wil
The sons the father kill,
The Children Chase the mother, and would heal
The wounds they give, by crying, zeal.
Then Cast her blood, and tears upon thy book
Where they for fashion look,
And like that Lamb which had the Dragons voice
Seem mild, but are known by their noise.
Thus by our lusts disordered into wars
Our guides prove wandering stars,
Which for these mists, and black days were reserved,
What time we from our first love swerved.
Yet O for his sake who sits now by thee
All crowned with victory,
So guide us through this Darkness, that we may
Be more and more in love with day;
Settle, and fix our hearts, that we may move
In order, peace, and love,
And taught obedience by thy whole Creation,
Become an humble, holy nation.
Give to thy spouse her perfect, and pure dress,
Beauty and holiness,
And so repair these Rents, that men may see
And say, Where God is, all agree.
The Shepherds.
SWeet, harmles lives! (on whose holy leisure
Waits Innocence and pleasure;)
Whose leaders to those pastures, and clear springs,
Were Patriarchs, Saints, and Kings,
How happend it that in the dead of night
You only saw true light,
While Palestine was fast a sleep, and lay
Without one thought of Day?
Was it because those first and blessed swains
Were pilgrims on those plains
When they received the promise, for which now
'I was there first shown to you?
It Is true, he loves that Dust whereon they go
That serve him here below,
And therefore might for memory of those
His love there first disclose;
But wretched Salem once his love, must now
No voice, nor vision know,
Her stately Piles with all their height and pride
Now languished and died,
And Bethlems humble Cotts above them stepped
While all her Seers slept;
Her Cedar, firr, hewed stones and gold were all
Polluted through their fall,
And those once sacred mansions were now
Mere emptiness and show,
This made the Angel call at reeds and thatch,
Yet where the shepherds watch,
And Gods own lodging (though he could not lack,)
To be a common Rack;
No costly pride, no soft-cloath'd luxury
In those thin Cells could lie,
Each stirring wind and storm blew through their Cots
Which never harbored plots,
Only Content, and love, and humble joys
Lived there without all noise,
Perhaps some harmless Cares for the next day
Did in their bosoms play,
As where to lead their sheep, what silent nook,
What springs or shades to look,
But that was all; And now with gladsome care
They for the town prepare,
They leave their flock, and in a busy talk
All toward Bethlem walk
To see their souls great shepherd, who was come
To bring all straglers home,
Where now they find him out, and taught before
That Lamb of God adore,
That Lamb whose days great Kings and Prophets wished
And longed to see, but missed.
The first light they beheld was bright and gay
And turned their night to day,
But to this later light they saw in him,
Their day was dark, and dim.
Misery.
LOrd, bind me up, and let me lie
A Prisoner to my liberty,
If such a state at all can be
As an Impris'ment serving thee;
The wind, though gathered in thy fist,
Yet does it blow still where it list,
And yet should thou let go thy hold
Those gusts might quarrel and grow bold.
As waters here, headlong and loose
The lower grounds still chase, and choose,
Where spreading all the way they seek
And search out every hole, and Creek;
So my spilt thoughts winding from thee
Take the down-rode to vanity,
Where they all stray and strive, which shall
Find out the first and steepest fall;
I cheer their flow, giving supply
To what is already grown too high,
And having thus performed that part
Feed on those vomits of my heart.
I break the fence my own hands made
Then lay that trespass in the shade,
Some fig-leafs still I do devise
As if thou had nor ears, nor Eyes.
Excess of friends, of words, and wine
Take up my day, while thou do shine
All unregarded, and thy book
Has not so much as one poor look.
If thou steal in amidst the mirth
And kindly tell me, I am Earth,
I shut thee out, and let that slip,
Such Music spoils good fellowship.
Thus wretched I, and most unkind,
Exclude my dear God from my mind,
Exclude him thence, who of that Cel
Would make a Court, should he there dwell.
He goes, he yields; And troubled sore
His holy spirit grieves therefore,
The mighty God, the eternal King
Does grieve for Dust, and Dust does sing.
But I go on, haste to Divest
My self of reason, till oppressed
And buried in my surfeits I
Prove my own shame and misery.
Next day I call and cry for thee
Who should not then come near to me,
But now it is thy servants pleasure
Thou must (and do) give him his measure.
Thou do, thou come, and in a shower
Of healing sweets thy self do power
Into my wounds, and now thy grace
(I know it well,) fills all the place;
I sit with thee by this new light,
And for that hour thou art my delight,
No man can more the world despise
Or thy great mercies better prize.
I School my Eyes, and strictly dwell
Within the Circle of my Cel
That Calm and silence are my Joys
Which to thy peace are but mere noise.
At length I feel my head to ache,
My fingers Itch, and burn to take
Some new Employment, I begin
To swel and foam and fret within.
" The Age, the present times are not
" To snudge in, and embrace a Cot,
" Action and blood now get the game,
" Disdein treads on the peaceful name,
" who sits at home too bears a load
" Greater than those that gad abroad.
Thus do I make thy gifts given me
The only quarrellers with thee,
I Would loose those knots thy hands did tie,
Then would go travel, fight or die.
Thousands of wild and waste Infusions
Like waves beat on my resolutions,
As flames about their fuel run
And work, and wind til all be done,
So my fierce soul bustles about
And never rests til all be out.
Thus wilded by a peevish heart
Which in thy music bears no part
I storm at thee, calling my peace
A Lethargy, and mere disease,
Nay, those bright beams shot from the eyes
To calm me in these mutinies
I style mere tempers, which take place
At some set times, but are thy grace.
Such is man's life, and such is mine
The worst of men, and yet still thine,
Still thine thou know, and if not so
Then give me over to my foe.
Yet since as easy it is for thee
To make man good, as bid him be,
And with one glaunce (could he that gain,)
To look him out of all his pain,
O send me from thy holy hill
So much of strength, as may fulfill
All thy delight (what ever they be)
And sacred Institutes in me;
Open my rockie heart, and fill
It with obedience to thy will,
Then seal it up, that as none see,
So none may enter there but thee.
O hear my God! hear him, whose blood
Speaks more and better for my good!
O let my Cry come to thy throne!
My cry not poured with tears alone,
(For tears alone are often foul)
But with the blood of all my soul,
With spirit-sighs, and earnest groans,
Faithful and most repenting mones,
With these I cry, and crying pine
Till thou both mend and make me thine.
The Sap.
COme sapless Blossom, creep not still on Earth
Forgetting thy first birth;
It Is not from dust, or if so, why do thou
Thus call and thirst for dew?
It tends not thither, if it does, why then
This growth and stretch for heaven?
Thy root sucks but diseases, worms there seat
And claim it for their meat.
Who placed thee here, did something then Infuse
Which now can tell thee news.
There is beyond the Stars an hill of myrrh
From which some drops fall here,
On it the Prince of Salem sits, who deals
To thee thy secret meals,
There is thy Country, and he is the way
And has withal the key.
Yet lived he here sometimes, and bore for thee
A world of misery,
For thee, who in the first man's loins did fall
From that hill to this vale,
And had not he so done, it is most true
Two deaths had bin thy due;
But going hence, and knowing well what woes
Might his friends discompose,
To show what strange love he had to our good
He gave his sacred blood
By will our sap, and Cordial; now in this
Lies such a heaven of bliss,
That, who but truly tastes it, no decay
Can touch him any way,
Such secret life, and virtue in it lies
It will exalt and rise
And actuate such spirits as are shed
Or ready to be dead,
And bring new too. Get then this sap, and get
Good store of it, but let
The vessel where you put it be for sure
To all your power most pure;
There is at all times (though shut up) in you
A powerful, rare dew,
Which only grief and love extract; with this
Be sure, and never miss,
To wash your vessel well: Then humbly take
This balm for souls that ache,
And one who drank it thus, assures that you
Shall find a Joy so true,
Such perfect Ease, and such a lively sense
Of grace against all sins,
That you will Confess the Comfort such, as even
Brings to, and comes from Heaven.
Mount of Olives.
WHen first I saw true beauty, and thy Joys
Active as light, and calm without all noise
Shined on my soul, I felt through all my powr's
Such a rich air of sweets, as Evening showrs
Fand by a gentle gale Convey and breath
On some parched bank, crowned with a flowrie wreath;
Odors, and Mirth, and balm in one rich flood
O'r-ran my heart, and spirited my blood,
My thoughts did swim in Comforts, and mine eye
Confessed, The world did only paint and lie.
And where before I did no safe Course steer
But wandered under tempests all the year,
Went bleak and bare in body as in mind,
And was blow'n through by every storm and wind,
I am so warmed now by this glance on me,
That, midst all storms I feel a Ray of thee;
So have I known some beauteous Paisage rise
In sudden flowers and arbours to my Eyes,
And in the depth and dead of winter bring
To my Cold thoughts a lively sense of spring.
Thus fed by thee, who do all beings nourish,
My withered leafs again look green and flourish,
I shine and shelter underneath thy wing
Where sick with love* strive thy name to sing,
Thy glorious name! which grant I may so do
That these may be thy Praise, and my Joy too.
Man.
WEighing the stedfastness and state
Of some mean things which here below reside,
Where birds like watchful Clocks the noiseless date
And Intercourse of times divide,
Where Bees at night get home and hive, and flowrs
Early, as well as late,
Rise with the Sun, and set in the same bowr^;
2.
I would (said I) my God would give
The staidness of these things to man! for these
To his divine appointments ever cleave,
And no new business breaks their peace;
The birds nor sow, nor reap, yet sup and dine,
The flowers without clothes live,
Yet Solomon was never dressed so fine.
3.
Man has still either toys, or Care,
He has no root, nor to one place is tied,
But ever restless and Irregular
About this Earth does run and ride,
He knows he has a home, but scarce knows where,
He says it is so far
That he has quite forgot how to go there.
4.
He knocks at all doors, strays and roams,
Nay has not so much wit as some stones have
Which in the darkest nights point to their homes,
By some hid sense their Maker gave;
Man is the shuttle, to whose winding quest
And passage through these looms
God ordered motion, but ordained no rest.

I Walked the other day (to spend my hour,)
Into a field
Where I sometimes had seen the soil to yield
A gallant flower,
But Winter now had ruffled all the bower
And curious store
I knew there heretofore.
2.
Yet I whose search loved not to peep and peer
In The sace of things
Thought with my self, there might be other springs
Besides this here
Which, like cold friends, sees us but once a year,
And so the flower
Might have some other bower.
3.
Then taking up what I could nearest spy
I dug about
That place where I had seen him to grow out,
And by and by
I saw the warm Recluse alone to lie
Where fresh and green
He lived of us unseen.
4.
Many a question Intricate and rare
Did I there strew,
But all I could extort was, that he now
Did there repair
Such losses as befell him in this air
And would ever long
Come forth most fair and young*
5.
This past, I threw the Clothes quite o'r his head,
And stung with fear
Of my own frailty dropped down many a tear upon his bed,
Then sighing whispered, Happy are the dead!
What peace does now
Rock him asleep below?
6.
And yet, how few believe such doctrine springs
From a poor root
Which all the Winter sleeps here under foot
And has no wings
To raise it to the truth and light of things,
But is still trod
By every wandering clod.
7.
O thou! whose spirit did at first inflame
And warm the dead,
And by a sacred Incubation fed
With life this frame
Which once had neither being, form, nor name,
Grant I may so
Thy steps track here below,
8.
That in these Masks and shadows I may see
Thy sacred way,
And by those hid ascents climb to that day
Which breaks from thee
Who art in all things, though invisibly;
Show me thy peace,
Thy mercy, love, and ease,
9.
And from this Care, where dreams and sorrows reign
Lead me above
Where Light, Joy, Leisure, and true Comforts move
Without all pain,
There, hid in thee, show me his life again
At whose dumb urn
Thus all the year I mourn.
Begging.
KIng of Mercy, King of Love,
In whom I live, in whom I move,
Perfect what thou have begun,
Let no night put out this Sun;
Grant I may, my chief desire!
Long for thee, to thee aspire,
Let my youth, my bloom of days
Be my Comfort, and thy praise,
That hereafter, when I look
O'r the sullyed, sinful book,
I may find thy hand therein
Wiping out my shame, and sin.
O it is thy only Art
To reduce a stubborn heart,
And since thine is victory,
Strong holds should belong to thee;
Lord then take it, leave it not
Unto my dispose or lot,
But since I would not have it mine,
O my God, let it be thine!
Jude ver. 24, 25. Now unto him that is able to keep us from falling, and to
present us faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, To
the only wise God, our Savior, be glory, and majesty, Dominion and power, now
and ever, Amen.
FINIS.
