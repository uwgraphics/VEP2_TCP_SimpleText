SOME CONSIDERATIONS CONCERNING The High-Court OF CHANCERY, AND THE ORDINANCE
MADE For the Regulation and Limitation OF THAT COURT.

LONDON, Printed in the Year, 1657.

SOME CONSIDERATIONS CONCERNING THE High Court of Chancery, etc.
THe Author of this Discourse, is a man utterly against the licentious
publishing of Pamphlets, as being very sensible of the danger ensuing by it,
and professes a dissability of composing any thing worth owning; But having
been a suitor and a sufferer in the high Court of Chancery for very many years,
even above the common age of man, and having found by experience the former
iniquity in the course of Practice in that Court, and the great benefit and
advantage of that most excellent Ordinance, made by his Highness, and his most
Honorable Council, for the regulation and limitation of that Court, and being
informed of some strong endeavors used to repeal and null that Ordinance, does
crave leave for the publication of these his Observations, that so the people
of this Nation, who have, or shall have occasion of suit in that Court, may be
informed of the benefit they have, or may receive by the Ordinance: In which he
a^meth at nothing but the public good and welfare of the Nation.

Amongst the many things that time and corruption had made the object of
Reformation in this Nation, nothing had more need of a Regulation and
Reforming, then the high Court of Chancery, which was formerly, and especially
of later times, so chargeable to Suitors in the prosecution, and defense of
their Causes, and so corrupt and uncertain in the practice thereof; that in
stead of a Sanctuary to the oppressed, it was become a most intolerable
burden to the Nation, and (notwithstanding all addresses to the long
Parliament) so continued, until the Parliament which began in the year 1653.
(which was composed of persons, though perhaps not very learned Statesmen, yet
doubtless men of very good and honest intentions, and very sensible of the
burdens of the Nation.) By whom it was voted to be taken away. But that
Parliament dissolving, it pleased his Highness to continue that Court, it
being indeed of very excellent use for the Nation, and without which it cannot
subsist, as the Common Law now stands, and both it and the Common Law being
challenged by the people, as their indubitate birthright.

Yet notwithstanding his Highness was pleased to appoint diverse of the Long
robe to consider of a way for the regulation and reformation of that Court, but
they (for what reason I know not) did not effect that good work, so much longed
for, and needed by the people of this Land.

Whereupon his Highness by advice of his most Honorable Council
(notwithstanding the other great and important businesses for the Government
and safety of the Nation lay on them) did make an Ordinance for the Regulation
and limitation of that Court. A better nor more accurate and excellent, this
Land and Nation never saw, which after much struggling, almost a year after the
making thereof, was put in execution; whereat, as no good man could take
exceptions, so none but those concerned in point of a corrupt interest, could
or did speak against it: and it may be well observed, that since the same was
put in execution, no complaints have been heard against it from the people, for
whose good and ease chiefly the same was made.

Yet nevertheless, since the beginni^g of this present Parliament, some
unnecessary, burthensom Officers, which either had part of their former
unconscionable gain taken from them, or else their Offices set aside, as
unnecessary, have been indefatigable in their endeavors, to get that most
excellent Ordinance repealed.

And a Committee of Parliament being app^inted for the view of the Ordinances
made by his Highness in the int^rvall of Parliaments, that Ordinance was most
especially struck at, through the clamours of those late unnecessary Officers
of that Court, who aimed not at the good of their Country, but their own
private unconscionable gain.

Nevertheless it pleased the Parliament to refer the matter to another
Committee to amend that Regulation settled by the Ordinance (if they saw cause)
and to send for parties Papers, etc. which Committee accordingly meeting the
Attorneys by command, and the late six Clerks attended them; where the Council
for the six Clerks was heard in a most tedious and impertinent discourse, and
the Attorneys receiving then a command from that Committee, to prepare their
reasons in writing, and to set forth wherein the Ordinance was good or bad for
the people, and a very short time given them to that purpose: They (as I have
heard) accordingly prepared their Reasons, and attended to have presented them
to the Committee.

But the Committee not afterward meeting, the Attorneys Reasons could not be
presented to them; and the Ordinance being since by Act of Parliament only to
continue during the sitting of this Parliament, it is much feared that it is
the drift of those persons who are left out as unnecessary Officers in that
Court, to improve their interest, and use all endeavors to hinder any further
consideration of the Ordinance by the Parliament, so that thereby the Ordinance
may fall to the ground, and the old way of Practice in that Court be set up
again, to the great prejudice of the Commonwealth.

It therefore much concerns all honest well minded people of this Nation,
that they make their humble addresses to the Parliament minding them, that
before the end thereof, they tak^ the Ordinance into consideration; and that
what shall appear to be good therein may be confirmed, and what shall be found
therein to be short for the intended welfare of the Nation, may be supplied,
and what appears to them to be any way discommodious to the people (if any
such thing there be) may be amended; that so, so good a constitution may not
fall to the ground unregarded, which has with so much deliberation and
resolution, been appointed for the good and ease of the people.

And to the end the people may be the better informed of the advantage they
have and shall receive by that Ordinance, it were to be wished that those
Reasons that the Attorneys or Clerks of the Chancery, had provided to be
presented to the Committee of Parliament, were made public. But as there is
just cause to fear that in them the Arrow was not drawn to the head (in their
composing, there being a great opposition, as I have been informed, even
amongst themselves) so without doubt they are now suppressed through the
influence and awe the before mentioned unnecessary Officers have over the
abject and private spirits of the present Attorneys.

The Ordinance in the first place provides a convenient number of Attorneys,
who are to solicit and manage the Clients Cause for 3s 4d a Term, which Fee
was formerly received by the six Clerks, for doing nothing at all for the
benefit of the Client, who was forced either to employ a Solicitor to manage
his business, to his great loss, or else to manage it himself, whereby his
Cause often times miscarried, through either his own or his Solicitors
ignorance.

For the other matters formerly done by the six Clerks, it is by Ordinance
provided to be done by three chief Clerks, who have Fees amounting to 500lb a
year a piece, which is a competent allowance for their labor, they being to
file the Pleadings and Records, to have an inspection upon the Attorneys, to
make Certificates of matters referred to them by the Court, touching the
regularity of proceedings, to set down Causes for hearing, and tax cost: all
which is better done by them, then ever it was done by the six Clerks; saving
that the Chief Clerks, who were three of the late six Clerks, are somewhat
sullen, and do not in some things pursue the Ordinance according to their duty.

Now this, and the abatement of the Fees, are the things that are struck at by
the late six Clerks, and other useless Officers, whose pretense is, that their
places, and the old Fees are their Freehold, and therefore ought not to be
taken from them; that they purchased their places, and that they are of great
antiquity.

As to their Freehold, I wonder whose Freehold their places had been, if the
little Parliament had passed an Act for taking away the Court, as the former
Parliament did for taking away the Star Chamber, and high Commission Court, and
this Parliament the Court of Wards, in which diverse as useful Officers as
they, without reparation, lost their places, as much their Freehold, as the six
Clerks, and also purchased at as dear rates. But the six Clerks may see their
own unjust practice justly retaliated on them, that used at their pleasures,
without cause, to turn out the Clerks bred up there, into the wide world to
starve, if they had nothing else to live upon.

And for their Antiquity, It is true, there was one Attorney, and but one at
the first institution of the Court, then as the business increased, two were
added, and then three more, in which number they by bribery a long time stood a
grand cheat to the people, and a crying oppression over the Clerks, who really
did the business of the Court. And since six Clerks cannot possibly perform
the Office of Attorneys, and perform the business of the Client, it is hoped
that it is no more injustice to increase the number of Attorneys now, then it
was in times past.

And I hope the six Clerks will be so ingenious, as to confess, that besides
the impossibility for them to solicit the Clients Causes, not one nor all of
them together, are able to do any thing belonging to an Attorney or Clerk to
do, viz. to draw all special Writs, Commissions, Decrees, Dismissions, and to
make and write all other Writs, and copy Records. This being true, why should
they be paid for what they neither do, or know how to do, or monopolize the
place of an Attorney, which they cannot execute.

Thus I hope it is apparent that their removal is no injustice, and that the
increase of the number of Attorneys is a benefit to the Commonwealth; and there
is no doubt, but if the Ordinance, as to the Officers, Clerks and Attorneys of
the Court, were put more strictly and duly in execution, it would be of
admirable benefit to all Suitors, and those that are sued in that Court. For,
the tediousness of suits, is by the Ordinance very well provided against, as
also diverse Writs, as Subpena's to make a better answer, and to rejoyn are
taken away: as likewise, whereas before, when witnesses were examined in Court,
or by Commission ex part, it was ordinarily two or three Terms before
publication could pass; now it is provided in the Ordinance to pass in a week.

Likewise the making of all Writs open, cannot but be a great satisfaction to
the people, they being thereby enabled to see whether the Writ have any mistake
in it or not; whereas while they were close, the Client was often put to a deal
of fruitless charge, especially in the Commissions, to examine Witnesses, as I
my self have found by experience: And likewise it is left by the Ordinance at
the Clients liberty to execute a Commission in any place, which without doubt
is, and may be of good consequence, for the amicable ending of suits,
especially if the Commissioners be men of judgment and integrity.

Also the frequent renewing of Commissions, tending only to delay, is well
provided against by the Ordinance, and the Defendants having a duplicate, is of
advantage to him, especially in cases where his witnesses are ancient and
sickly.

Likewise the granting of Injunctions merely upon the course of the Court, viz.
upon the Defendants taking a Commission to answer, sitting in contempt, or
making an insufficient answer, was heretofore a great grievance to the Nation,
but very well provided by the Ordinance, to be granted only upon sound and
satisfactory grounds.

And also whereas heretofore a Defendant could hardly put in any Answer, but
the Plaintiff would put in exceptions to it, which were referred to a Master,
who usually favored the Plaintiff, and so the Client was put to a double
charge: Now by the Ordinance it is provided, that only the Master of the Rolls
shall hear them; and the most honorable and judicious Gentleman, the present
Master of the Rolls, has so impartially heard those matters, that it is
believed the putters in of frivolous exceptions, have little encouragement
thereto for the future, which is also a great ease to the people.

Likewise the making of orders upon whispering petitions is provided against,
and orders to be made only upon motion in Court, and therein also the right
Honorable the Lords Commissioners of the great Seal, are much to be honored
for their order of notice upon motions.

And the provisions in the Ordinance concerning Mortgages are very just and
impartial, and the Mortgager has thereby a convenient time for redemption of
his Land, and the other a sure way for recovery of his just debt, which
formerly he received by minute parcels, whereas his Mortgage money was lent in
gross, and the Mortgager often enforced to an account after twenty years
possession, to his great and intolerable damage.

Also the provision for References to be determined by three of the six Masters
of the Chancery in ordinary together, is most excellent; the benefit to the
people by it, is very apparent, and I my self cannot but recompt it as
beneficial in my particular cases, with gratitude for the Justice by them done;
and I shall not much insist on this particular, because the grievance formerly
was crying, and universally known and felt, and the parties that did the wrong
are deceased, and therefore I wish their doings may be buried with them, and I
have so much charity, as to hope they did according to their Judgments; and it
shall be my prayer that the Ordinance may be punctually observed, and neither
Masters nor their Register, for any respects whatsoever, recede from their
directions in and by the Ordinance, and then it must be a new generation that
will complain against them, I have good reason to hope this will not, if they
have done, and shall persevere to do according to the Ordinance.

It is also provided by the Ordinance, that the Registers places shall not be
executed by Deputies, which I hope no man will speak against, for what reason
is there that another person should have a tribute out of the labor of men who
spend a great part of their age in attaining to ability in their profession,
and then take a great deal of pains to do the Clients business; Why shall the
poor Client pay for the Sack and Satin of another, by whom he receives no
benefit, and the allowance yielded to the labourer there, by the unnecessary
ignorant Officer so mean, that if the Client had not yielded a supply, there
was not a sufficient recompense for the care and labor taken by those that
were Deputies formerly, but now stand on their own legs; and sure I am that if
the Ordinance, as concerning the Registers be duly and conscionably observed,
none will find fault, but those persons who without art or conscience would
thrust themselves into places they are not able to execute.

The Ordinance also provides well that the chief Examiners do examine all the
witnesses themselves, and not by Deputies (as it seems they do) the Ordinance
notwithstanding. And if they are not able so to do, either through their own
incapacity, or the multiplicity of business, if the present Examiners be
removed, or others of ability and honesty be added to them, I hope it will not
be a grievance worthy of any complaint.

The great cry against the Ordinance, under color whereof the cashiered
Officers have thrust in this head of their Serpentine complaints, is, that the
Court must not relieve against new Bonds, and that Legacies shall be sued for
at Law, I conceive that at the making of the Ordinance a provision was intended
in those cases for a relief to be had at the Common Law, but if upon second
thoughts the Chancery shall be thought the fittest Court to give relief
therein, I wish the Suitors speedy and just relief there.

Likewise the Fees are lessened to half what they were before, or less, which
I hope will be confessed to be an ease to the people.

I shall not grudge at the Fees given to Council, and only pray that those
Gentlemen may have pity and compassion on the poor Suitors to the Court, and
that they press not an evil cause too far.

I could have wished that some abler pen might have showed the usefulness of
this Ordinance to the people, being my self, I confess, insufficient to do it,
but by this imperfect discovery, the perfection of that excellent constitution
may in part appear, and the drift of this endeavor being for the information
of the people, and for their good and advantage, I hope the imperfections
thereof will be pardoned, and that the adversaries to the peoples welfare will
not prevail against this Ordinance, which was by the Supreme Magistrate of this
Commonwealth, and his Council, with so great wisdom and exactness provided for
their good.

A Postscript to the Attorneys of the CHANCERY.
Gentlemen,
YOu are the persons that are entrusted by the people, who have occasion of
suit in Chancery, and the people do willingly pay you the Fees appointed by the
Ordinance as your due, you have many times made complaints of the oppression
and injury done you by your late Masters, as that it was the only badge of
villanage left in the Nation; you are now at liberty, repine not at your
deliverers, and seek not to return again into bondage: The Ordinance gives you
a propriety, lose it not by your silence: A little of a man's own, is better
then much retained with an evil conscience. If the Ordinance fall by which you
have your title, you have no right to any thing there, your Places, your Fees
are not then to be reckoned. Join then your helping hand, you know better then
I, and are better provided with reasons; In gratitude to his Highness make
them public, and be assured that if once your quondam Masters prevail to be
Lords over you, your lives will be the most uncomfortable, and your selves the
absolutest slaves in the world. I hope some of you are wise, let a word
therefore suffice.

FINIS.
