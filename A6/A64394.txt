Six COMEDIES Of that excellent Poet PUBLIUS TERENTIUS an African of Carthage
in English and Latin.

For the use of young Scholars, that they may the more readily attain the
purity of the Latin tongue for common discourse.

By CHARLES HOOLE, near Lothbury-Garden, London.

The Translator's Advertisement to the READER.
Good-Reader,
I Have at last (by God's blessing) effected, which I heretofore had promised
that Worshipful Company of Stationers, the Translation of Terence. Touching
the usefulness of which Author for the gaining the Latin tongue, I need say no
more, then that Cicero made it his Master; and the generality of Scholars are
of Barlandus s opinion, that that Language will never be lost whilst Terence
may be had. I will not insist here upon the Benefit of Translations, having
said enough concerning it in my Preface to Cato. Forth Method I have used in
Translating this Book, I have Presidents in French and High Dutch. Wherein I
differ from Mr. Bernard, and what I have omitted, may easily be seen, and the
reasons thereof guessed.

But the main of what I would have the Readers take notice, is this: the Latin
Copy which is here published is that of Cardinal Bembus; which that famous
Antiquary Sir Henry Wotton had bought at Venice, and bestowed upon a young
Gentleman, a friend or kinsman's son of his (as it seems) in or about London.
The Manu-script written in Vellum is dated A. D. 1491. which I prize the more,
because I find it clears many the most difficult places, about which Critics
too mistakingly contend, and many the most learned of them ever and anon make
their appeal ad codicem Bembianum.

I freely offer what I have done especially for the Benefit of young Scholars,
(amongst whom, not withstanding my weightier charge elsewhere, I am again
occasionally conversant) to the kind acceptance of any that shall please to
use it; accounting it a Blessing from God, if by this or any other my labor I
may forward Learning, which has ever proved a most necessary Mean to the
settlement and propagation of Religion and Virtue; especially where Children
are instituted in such Principles as may correct the vitiosities of this and
the like Heathenish authors.

ANDRIA TERENTII Anglo-Latina.

TERENCE'S ANDRIA ENGLISH AND LATIN.

ANDRIA.
1. A Comedy touching one Chrysis, a Woman of Andro, (which is an Island in
the Mediteranean Sea) made by Publius Terentius an African of Carthage.

2. Acted at the Megalesian Games (exhibited by the Romans in Honor of their
(...), or great Gods, but especially of the Goddess Cybele, which was called
the Mother of the Gods) which began (as Goreanus observes out of Tully) about
the beginning of September, and lasted nine days, or (as some others write) on
the fourth of April, and continued six days.

When M. Fulvius and M. Glabrio were Aediles, or Officers, whose charge being
to oversee the Temples and private Houses which belonged to the City of Rome,
and to make provision for Stage Plays; they bought this Comedy, and took Order
to have it publicly acted. They were called Curules, because they were chosen
out of the Senators, and permitted to ride in (sella curuli) a Chair of State.

3. The chief Players, or Actors of it, were 1. L. Ambivius Turpio, 2. and L.
Attilius Prenestinus.


4. Flaccus the Son of Claudius was the Musician or Song-man, that set or
appointed the tunes to be played on Shaumes or Hoboyes, or the like Pipes,
which had an even number of holes in them; And first with them that made a base
sound, and were held on the right side of the mouth, when serious matters were
acted; and then with such as made a shriller noise, and were held on the left
side of the mouth, when jesling, and merry conceits were used.

5. And the Comedy is altogether a Greek one, translated out of that excellent
Poet Menander, and contains in it nothing of any Roman business, but what
was done at Athens; and therefore i^. was acted in Mantles or Cloaks after the
Greek fashion.

6. It was published when M. Marcellus, and Cajus Sulpitius were Consuls of
Rome.

7. In the Year Since Rome was built, 587. Before Christ was born, 162.

A Brief Argument of Caius Sulpitius Apollinaris, (who was Tutor to the
Emperor Pertinax) on Terence's Andria.
PAmphilus defloureth Glycerie, who was falsely thought to be
The sister of a whore, that was an Andrian woman by birth;
And when she was great with child, he plighted his faith to her,
That she should be his wife: also his father Simo had affianced to him
(Philumena) the daughter of Chremes; and as soon as he found for certain, that
he was in love,
He makes as though there should be a marriage; being desirous to know,
What mind his son had toward it:
Pamphilus, through Davus's persuasion, is not against it.
But after Chremes saw that Glycerie had a young son,
flies off from the match, and renounceth his son in Law.
Within a while after he bestows this his daughter Glycerie (which was known
unlooked for)
Upon Pamphilus, and his other daughter for a wife upon Charinus.
C. Sulpitii Apollinaris Periocha in Terentii Andriam.
SOrorem falso creditam meretriculae,
Genere Andriae, Glycerium vitiat Pamphilus.
Gravidaque facta, dat fidem, uxorem sibi
Fore hanc: nam aliam pater ei desponderat

Simulat futuras nuptias; cupiens, suus
Quid haberet animi filius, cognoscere.
Davi suasu non, repugnat Pamphilus.
Sed ex Glycerio natum ut vidit puerulum
recusat nuptias, generum abdicat.
Mox filiam Glycerium, Insperato agnitam
Dat Pamphilo hanc, aliam Charino conjugem.

The Prologue.
WHen first the Poet (Terence) gave his mind to write (Comedies)
He thought it was the only business he had to look after,
That what Comedies he made might please the people:
But he finds it to fall out far otherwise;

Not that he may tell one the Plot, but answer the railing terms
Of the cankered old Poet (Luscus Lavinius.)
Now I pray you consider what thing they account as a fault:
Menander made Andria and Perinthia:

They differ not very much in the matter, yet
Are they much unlike in the composition, and manner of speech;
He confesses he took out of Perinthia, and put into Andria,
Those things which were sitting (for his purpose) and used them as his own.

Saying, it is not fit that Comedies should be spoiled:
Truly by making themselves so wise, they discover their own ^olly;
Who when they blame him, they find fault also
With Naevius, Plautus, and Ennius, whom this our Poet follows as his
Authors:

Than the over-clouded diligence of those fellows.
Now henceforth I advise them to be quiet hereafter, and forbear
To give ill language, least they come to hear of their ill doings.
Keep silence, show your selves impartial, and consider the matter,
viz.
Whether what Comedies he shall make a new hereafter,
Be worthy to be beheld, or driven off the stage rather by them.
Prologus.
POeta quum primum animum ad scribendum appulit,
Id sibi negoti credidit solum dari,
Populo ut placerent, quas fecissit fabulas.
Verum aliter evenire multo intelligit;

Non qui argumentum narrer, sed qui malevoli
Veteris Poetae maledict is respondeat.
Nunc quam rem vitio dent, quaeso, animum advertite;
Menander fecit Andriam and Perinthiam;

Non ita dissimili sunt argumento, sed tamen
Dissimili oratione sunt factae, ac stylo,
Quae convenere, in Andriam ex Pirinthia^
Fatetur transtulisse; atque usum pro suis:

Contaminari non decere fabulas.
Faciunt nae intelligendo ut nihil intelligant:
Qui cum hunc accusant, Naevium, Plautum, Ennium
Accusant; quos hic noster authors habet:

Potius, quam istorum obscuram diligentiam.
Dehinc ut quiescant, porro monco, and desinant
Maledicere, malefacta ne noscant sua.
Favete, adeste aequo animo, and rem cognoscite,

Posthac quas faciet de integro comaedias,
Spectandae, an exigendae sint vobis prius.
The First Scene of the First Act.
SIMO. SOSIA. Si. YOu (Sirs) take these things away in a doors; get you gone.
Sosia,
Come hither: I will speak a word or two with you.

So. I know what you would say,
For sooth, that these things should be well looked unto.

Si. Nay, something else.

So. What is it?
That my skill can do for you more then this?

Si.
But these which I always observed to be in you,
Faithfulness and secrecy.

So. I wait to know your pleasure:

Si. You know what a fair and easy service you always had with me,
Ever since I bought you of a little boy:

Because you did serve me with a good will;
I have requited you with the best thing I had.

So. I am mindful of it.

Si. I do not repent of what I have done.

So. I am glad,
If I have done, or do do any thing that likes you Simo; and

But this (speech of yours) troubles me, for this rehearsal of old things
Is as it were an upbraiding of one that is forgetful of a good turn:
But do you tell me in a word what it is you would have with me.

Si. So I will do: But first and foremost, I tell you this concerning this
matter,


So. Why do you pretend it then?

Si. You shall hear all the matter from the beginning;
By that means you shall understand my sons course of life, and my intent,
And what I would have you do in this matter.
For after he came toward man's estate, Sosia,

How could one know or discern his disposition,
Whilst want of years, fear and a Master held him in?

So. It is true.

Si. That which all young men for the most part use to do,
Giving their minds to one employment or other, either
To keep horses or dogs for hunting, or to (hear) Philosophers;
He minded none of these things extraordinarily more then others,
And yet he minded them all pretty well.
I was glad of it.

So. Not without cause, for I hold it to be
A thing very requisite in ones life, that he do nothing too much.

Si.
With whomsoever he kept company, to yield himself to them,
And to do as they did, being thwart to no body,
Nor at any time putting forth himself before them; so as one may easily
Get commendations without envy, and purchase friends.

So.
Soothing gains friends, and true-dealing hatred.

Si. In the mean time a certain Woman about three years ago,
Removed from Andri into this neighborhood,
Being driven to it by poverty, and the neglect of her kindred;


So. Alas, I am afraid lest this Andrian Woman should bring something that is
naught.

Si. At the first she lived chastely, sparingly and hardly,
Seeking to get a livelihood by spinning and carding;
But after a lover came and offered her hire,

Men is prone to fall from labor and follow lust)
She took their offer, and afterward began to make a gain of it,
They who then loved her, by chance, as it fell out,
Brought my son thither with them, to bear them company.

He has his pay. I did watch their foot betimes in a morning,
As they came and went, I used to ask them; Do thou hear, boy?
I pray thee tell me, who had Chrysis yesterday? For that
Was the name of that Andrian woman.

So. I understand you.

Si. They said
Phaedrus, or Clinia, or Niceratus; fon these three then
Loved all at once, Oh, but what did Pamphilus? what? he paid
His club, he supt with them; I was glad of it. Likewise another day
I made enquiry: I found nothing at all did touch Pamphilus,
In good earnest I thought him to be a sufficiently tried,

For he that has to strive with men of such like dispositions,
And yet for all that his mind is not moved in that matter;
One may conclude he is a man able to have the guiding of his life.
That both pleased me well, and besides all men with one consent

That had a Son endued with so towardly a nature.
What needs many words? Chremes being moved by this report,
Came to me of his own mind, that he might bestow
His only daughter on my son for a wife, with a huge great portion.


So. What hinders, that a real marriage is not made?

Si. You shall hear;
Within a few days, almost in which these things were a doing,
This our neighbor Chrysis died.

So. O well done!
You have made me happy: I doubted some harm from Chrysis.

Si. There then my son
Chrysis;
He took order as well as they for the funeral; being sad all the while;
Now and then he shed a tear with them. This also pleased me well.
I thought thus with my self; he for a little acquaintance sake,
Takes this woman's death so heavily to be art:

I thought all these to be the properties of a kind nature,
Avd a gentle disposition. Why do I hold you with many words?
I my self also for his sake go forth to the burial,
Suspecting no harm at all.

So. How now, what is the matter!

Si. You shall know.

That were there, I chanced to espy one young Damsel
Of a feature.

So. That was good perhaps.

Si. And Sosia, Of a countenance
So modest, and so comely, that more could not be (in a woman.)
Because then she seemed to me to take on more then the rest,

I went to the maids that waited on her,
And asked who she might be; they said she was Chrysis sister:
It presently struck me to the heart. Alas, this is it indeed;
Hence come all those tears, this is the pity that he takes.

So.

Si. The funeral in the mean time,
Goes on forward: we follow after, we come to the burial place;
She is put into the fire; they weep. In the mean while this Sister
Whom I spoke of, came to the flame somewhat rashly,
With a deal of danger. Then Pamphilus being much affrighted,

He runs to her: he takes the woman about the middle in his arms.
Ah my Glycerie, quoth he, what do you do? why go you about to cast away your
self?
Then she, so as one might easily perceive their wonted love,
Threw her self back upon him weeping very heavily.

So. Si. I return thence being angry, and taking it ill;
Neither had I cause sufficient for to chide him; he might have said
What have I done? what punishment have I deserved, or wherein have I done
amiss?
I have hindered her that would have thrown her self into the fire,
I have saved her life, this is an honest excuse.

So. You think rightly:

What would you do to him that has wrought one harm or mischief?

Si. Chremes came to me the next day, crying out,
That he had found out a shameful act, that Pamphilus
Used this strange woman as if she were his wife. I stoutly

I so parted from him, as from one that denied to match his daughter
To my son.

So. Did not you chide your son then?

Si. Neither was this indeed
A sufficient cause to chide him. So. Why so? tell me.

Si. He might have said, Father, you your self have appointed an end for these
things,

Let me now in the mean time, live as I will my self.

So. What occasion then is there left to chide him?

Si. If he will not marry a wife (which is promised) because of his love to
Glycerie,
He must first be punished for that fault,

I may have a just cause to chide him, if he quite deny it.
And withal that that roguish Davus, if he have any knavish device,
May vent it now whilst his tricks can do no harm:
Who I verily believe will do all he can with tooth and nail,

Then to follow my sons humor.

So. Why so?

Si. Do you ask?
An evil mind, an evil meaning; whom truly, if I find him
But need is there of words? But if it fall out as I desire,
That there be no stop in Pamphilus; Chremes remain's

Now it is your part, that you handsomely fain this marriage,
That you fright Davus to purpose, and be sure to watch my son,
What he does, and what advice he takes with him.

So. It is enough,
I will have a care of it; let us go in now.

Si. Go before, I will come after.

Actus Primi Scena Prima.
SIMO. SOSIA. Si. VOs isthaec intro auferte: abite. Sosia,

Nempe ut curentur recte haec.

Si. Rem omnem a principio audies.
Eo pacto and gnati vitam, and consilium meum
Cognosces, and quid facere in hac re te velim.
Nam is postquam excessit ex ephaebis, Sosia,

Qui scire posses aut ingenium noscere,
Dum aetas, metus, magister prohibebant?

So. Ita est.

Si. Quod plerique omnes faciunt adolescentuli,
Ut animum ad aliquod studium adjungant, aut equos
Alere, aut canes ad venandum, aut ad Philosophes;
Horum ille nihil egregie praeter caetera
Studebat, and tamen omnia haec mediocriter.
Gaudebam.

So. Non injuria: nam id arbitror
Adprime in vita esse utile, ut ne quid nimis.

Si.
Cum quibus erat cunque una, iis sese dedere,
Eorum obsequi studiis, adversus nemini,
Nunquam praeponens se illis; ita facillime
Sine invidia laudem invenias, and amicos pares.

So.
Obsequium amicos, veritas odium parit.

Si. Interea mulier quaedam abhinc triennium

So. Hei, vereor, ne quid Andria apporter mali.

Si. Primum haec pudice vitam, parce, ac duriter
Agebat, lana ac tela victum quaeritans:
Sed postquam amans accessit, pretium pollicens,

Hominum a labor proclive ad libidinem)
Accepit conditionem, dein quaestum occipit.
Qui tum illam amabant, forte, ita ut fit, filium
Perduxere illuc secum, ut una esset, meum:

Habet. Observabam mane illorum servulos
Venientes aut abeuntes, rog^t^bam; Heus puer,
Dic sodes, quis heri Chrysidem habuit? nam Andriae
Illi id erat nomen.

So. Tenco.

Si. Phaedrum, aut Cliniam

Amabant. Eho, quid Pamphilus? quid? symbolam
Dedit, caenavit: gaudebam. Item alio die
Quaerebam; comperiebam nihil ad Pamphilum
Quicquam attingere. Enimve. o spectatum satis

Nam qui cum ingeniis conflictatur ejusmodi,
Neque comm^^etur animus in ea re tamen;
Scias posse habere jam ipsum suae vitae modum.
Cum id mihi placebat, tum uno ore omnes omnia

Qui gnatum haberem tali ingenio praeditum.
Quid verbis opus est? hac fama impulsus Chremes
Ultro ad me venit, unicam gnatam suam
Cum dote summa filio uxorem ut daret.


So. Quid obstat, cur non verae fiant?

Si. Audies.
Fere in diebus paucis, quibus haec acta sunt,
Chrysis vicina haec moritur.

So. O factum been!
Beasti; metui a Chryside.

Si. Ibi tum filius meus
Chrysidem, una aderat frequens;
Curabat una funus, trist is interim;
Nonnunquam conlachrymabat. Placuit tum id mihi.
Sic cogitabam: hic parvae consuetudinis
Causa, mortem hujus tam fert familiariter:

Haec ego putabam esse omnia humani ingenii
Mansuetique animi officia. Quid multis moror?
Egomet quoque ejus causa in funus predeo,
Nihil suspicans etiam mali:

So. Hem, quid est?

Si. Scies.

Quae ibi aderant, forte unam adspicio adolescentulam,
Forma.

So. Bona fortasse.

Si. Et vultu, Sosia,
Adeo modesto, adeo venusto, ut nihil supra.
Quia tum mihi lamentari praeter caeteras

Honesta ac liberali, accedo ad paedissequas,
Quae sit rogo; sororem esse aiunt Chrysidis.
Percussit illico animum. Atat, hoc illud est:
Hinc illae lachrymae; haec illa est misericordia.

So.

Si. Funus interim
Procedit: sequimur: ad sepnlchrum venimus:
In ignem posita est: Fletur. Interea haec soror,
Quam dixi, ad flammam accessit imprudentius
Satis cum periculo. Ibi tum exanimatus Pamphilus

Adcurrit: mediam mulierem complectitur.
Mea Glycerium, inquit, quid agis? cur te is perditum?
Tum illa, ut consuetum facile morem cerneres,
Rejecit se in eum flens quam familiariter.

So.

Si. Redeo inde iratus, atque aegre ferens:
Nec satis ad objurgandum causae; diceret,
Quid feci? quid commerui aut peccavi, pater?
Quae sese voluit in ignem injicere, prohibui,
Servavi, Honesta oration est.

So. Recte putas:

Quid facias illi, qui dederit damnum, aut malum?

Si. Venit Chremes postrid^e ad me, clamitans,
Indignum facinus comperisse; Pamphilum
Pro uxore habere hanc peregrinam. Ego illud sedulo

Ita tum discedo ab illo, ut qui se filiam
Negat daturum.

So. Non tu ibi gnatum?

Si. Ne haec quidem
Satis vehemens causa ad objurgandum.

So. Qui, cedo?
Si tute ipse his rebus finem praescripsti, pater.

Sine nunc me meo vivere interea modo.

So. Quis igitur relictus est objurgandi locus?

Si. Si propter amorem uxorem nolit ducere,
Ea primum ab illo animadvertenda injuria est.

Vera objurgandi causa sit, si deneget.
Simul, sceleratus Davus si quid consilii
Habet, ut consumat nunc, cum nihil obsint doli:
Quem ego credo manibus pedibusque obnixe omnia

Quam ut obsequatur gnato.

So. Quapropter?

Si. Rogas?
Mala men's, malus animus. Quem quidem ego si sensero --
Sed quid opus est verbis? sin eveniat quod volo,
In Pamphilo ut nihil sit morae; restat Chremes,

Nunc tuum est officium, has been ut adsimules nuptias;
Perterrefacias Davum, observes filium,
Quid agat, quid cum illo consilii capte^.

So. Sat est,
Curabo, eamus jam nunc intro.

Si. I prae, sequar.

Act. 1. Scene 2.
SIMO, DAVUS. S. THere is no doubt, but my son will have no wife:
I perceived Davus erewhile to fear so, as soon as he heard
That there was likely to be a marriage; but he hmself comes forth a doors.

D. I wondered, if this matter should go thus, and I feared

That a wife would not be given to his son, did never
Speak a word to any one of us, nor did he take it impatiently.

S. But now he will, and as I suppose, to thy great cost.

D. This was it that he aimed at, that we should be brought unawares into a
fools Paradise;

So as we might have no time to think how to hiuder the marriage:
It is cunningly done.

S. What says the Rogue?

D. Here is my master, and I was not aware of him.

S. Davus!

D. How now, what is the matter?

S. Come hither to me.

D. What would this fellow have?

S. What say you?

D. About what?

S. Do thou ask? It is reported that my Son is in love.

D.

S. Do thou mind what I say, or no.

D. Truly I mind it.

S. But, for me now to sift out these things,
It is the property of a harsh Father; for what he did heretofore, belongs
not at all to me.
Whilst time permitted that matter, I let him take his swinge.
Now it is time for him to take another course, and to change his manners;
Davus, that he may now become a new man.

D. What should this mean?

S. All that are in love take it ill that a wife should be appointed them.

D. So they say.

S. Then If one have got a l^wd Tutor for that matter,
He commonly turns his crazy mind the wrong way.

D. Truly I do not understand you.

S. No! How now?

D. No, I am plain Davus, not Oedipus, the expounder of Riddles.

S.

D. Yes indeed.

S. If I perceive thee go about any knavery to day concerning the marriage,
that it may not be:
Or that thou have a mind to show in the matter, how crafty thou art;
I will commit thee Davus into the house of Correction to be whipped to death,
On this condition and aboding, that if I take thee out thence, I will grind for
thee.


D. Yes, very well:
Now you have spoke the thing plainly, you have not gone about the bush.

S. I can more willingly abide to be abused in any thing then in this.

D. Good words I pray you.

S. Do thou mock me? I know thee well enough: But I tell thee,
That thou do it not too rashly, and that thou may not say, but that ^air
warning was given thee.

Actus I. Scen. II.
Simo. Davus. S. NOn dubium est, quin uxorem nolit filius:
Ita Davum modo timere sensi, ubi nuptias
Futuras esse audivit; sed ipse exit for as.

D. Mirabar, hoc si sic abiret; and heri semper lenitas,

Non datum iri filio uxorem suo, nunquam cuiquam
Nostrum verbum fecit, neque id aegre tulit.

S. At nunc faciet, neque ut opinor, sine tuo magno malo.

D. Id voluit, nos sic nec opinantes duci falso gaudio,

Ut ne esset spatium cogitandi ad disturbandas nuptias.
Astute!

S. Carnifex quae loquitur?

D. Herus est, neque praevideram,

S. Dave!

D. Hem, quid est?

S. Ehodum ad me.

D. Qui^ hic volt?

S. Quid ais?

D. Qua de re?

S. Rogas? Meum gnatum rumor est


D. Id populus curat scilicet.

Sim. Hoccine agis
Annon?

D. Ego vero istuc.

Si. Sed nunc ea me exquirere,
Iniqui patris est; nam, quod antehac fecit, nihil ad me attinet.
Dum tempus ad ^am rem tulit, sivi animum ut expleret suum,
Nunc hic dies aliam vitam adfert, alios mores postulat.


D. Hoc quid sit?

S. Omnes qui amant, graviter sibi uxorem dari ferunt.

D. Ita a junt.

S. Tum si quis magistrum cepit ad eam rem improbum, ^psum animum aegrotum ad
deteriorem partem plerunque applicat.

D. Non hercle intelligo.

S. Non? hem.

D. Non: Davus sum, non O^dipus.

S.

D. Sane quidem.
Si sensero hodie quicquam in his te nuptiis fallacia conari quo fiant minus:
^ut velle in re ostendi quam sis callidus,
^erberibus caesum te in pistrinum Dave, dedam, usque ad necem,
^a lege atque omine, ut si te inde exemerim, ego pro te molam.
(...). Quid? hoc intellextin? an nondum etiam ne hoc quidem?

D. Imo callide.
(...) aperte ipsam rem modo locutus, nihil circuitione usus es.
Ubivis, facilius passus sam, quam in hac re, me deludier.
Bona verba, quaeso.

S. Irrides? nihil me fallis. Sed dico tibi,
(...) temere facias, neque tu haud dicas, tibi non praedictum cave.

Act I. Scen. III.
Davus. IN good troth, Davus, it is no time (for thee) to be sloathfull and
sluggish;
As far as I apprehended of late the old man's intent about the marriage,
Which if it be not cunningly prevented, it will overthrow me or my Master:
Nor am I resolved certainly what to do; whether I should help Pamphilus, or
give ear to the old man:
Pamphilus, I am afraid of his life; but if I help him; I fear the old man's
threats about the marriage,
Whom it is a hard matter to beguile: For first he has already found the truth
about this love matter,
And he watches me with a deadly-eye, lest I should play any knavery:
If he catch me, I am undone; or if he list, he will take an occasion:
So be it right or wrong, he will send me headlong into the house of correction.
Andrian woman,
Whether she be his wife, or his sweetheart, is with child by Pamphilus.
And it is worth the labor to hear their bold presumption: For they begin
themselves
Like madfolks, not like lovers: Whatever God shonld send her, they resolved to
bring it up.
And they feign a apiece of knavery now amongst them,
(Glycerie) is a Citizen of Athens. There was (s^ they) a good while ago an old
man
A merchant; he suff^red shipwreck at the Isle Andr^:
He deceased: there then Chrysis Father harbored
This girl being cast ashore, being succourless, and small. These ar^ but
tales,
I do not think it likely to be true, and yet the conceit pleases them.
Mysis comes sorth from her, now I will go hence to the market, that
I may speak with Pamphilus, lest his father come upon him at un^ wares about
this matter.

Act. I. Scen. III.
Davus. ENimvero, Dave, nihil loci est segnitiae, neque socordiae,
Quantum intellexi modo senis sententiam de nuptiis:
Quae si non ast ^providentur, me aut herum pess^ndabunt.
Nec quid agam, certum est: Pamphilumne adjutem, an auscultem seni.

Cui verba dare difficile est. Primum jam de amore hoc comperit;
Me infensus servat, ne quam faciam in nuptiis fallaciam.
Si senserit, perii; aut si libitum fuerit, causam ceperit,
Quo jure, quaque injuria, praecipitem me in pistrinum dabit.

Sive ista uxor, sive amica est; gravida a Pamphilo est,
Audireque little est operae pretium audaciam. Nam incaeptio est
Amentium, haud amantium. Quicquid peperisset, decreverunt tollere.
Et fingunt quandam inter se nunc fallaciam,

Mercator: navem is fregit apud Andrum insulam:
Is obiit mortem: ibi tum hanc ejectam Chrysidis
Patrem recepisse orbam, parvam. Fabulae.
Mihi quidem hercle non fit verisimile, atqui ipsis commetum placet.

Conveniam Pamphilum, ne de hac re pater imprudentem opprimat.

Act I. Scene IV.
Mysis. ARchillis, I heard you erewhile, you bid Lesbia should be fetched;
In very deed, she is a drunken woman, and rash-handed,
And scare fit with whom one should adventure a woman of her first child.
Yet I will go setch her; I pray you, mind the importuna^ness of the old trot,

A safe deliverance, and her to miss in her office rather toward others.
But what is the matter I see Pamphilus so dismayed? I fear what it should be
for.
I will tarry to know what heavy news this trouble of mind brings us.

Act. I. Scen. IV.
Mysis. AUdivi, Archillis, jamdudum: Lesbiam adduci jubes:
Sane pol illa temuienta est mulier, and temeraria,
Nec satis digna, eui committas primo partu mulierem,
Tamen eam adducam. Importunitatem spectate aniculae;

Huic pariundi, atque illi in aliis potius peccandi locum.
Sed quidnam Pamphilum exanimatum video? vereor, quid si^t.
Opperiar, ut sciam, number quidnam haec turba tristitiae adferat.

Act. I. Scene V.
Pamphilus. Mysis. P. IS this a friendly deed, or undertaking? Is this
The part of a father?

M. What is that he says?

P. O the faith of gods and men!
What is, if this be not, a mere spite? He was resolved
To bestow a wife on me to day. Was it not meet I should have know^ of it
before? was it not meet


M. Ah me poor woman, what words do I hear?

P. What means Chremes? who had denied to give his daughter to wife,
He has altered that resolution, because he sees me so constant;
Is he so crossly bent to part me poor man from Glycerie,
Which if it come to pass, I am flat undone: That any man

O the faith of God and man! Can I by no means avoid
The alliance of Chremes? How many ways am I scorned and slighted;
All things were done and dispatched: Lo, I that was cast off am again sent for.
Why so? except it be as I suspect; they cloak some secret fault.


M. This saying
Has abashed me poor woman with fear.

P. For what should I say of my father? Alas,
That he should do such a great matter so carelessly! as he passed by me erewhile
At the market, he said, Pamphilus, you must be married to day, get you ready;
Go your way home; me thought he said, Go quickly and hang thy self;

Or to make any excuse, were it never so absurd, false, or unjust? I was dumb:
But had I wist that before, if one should ask me what I would have done?
I would have done somewhat, so as I might not do this. But now what shall I do
first?
So many cares entangle me, which hale my mind too and fro.

Besides the shame of my father, who has so gently suffered me hitherto,
To do whatsoever pleased my own humor: Should I cross him,
Woe is me! I am uncertain what to do.

M. I silly woman do fear,
What this uncertain thing may come to: But now it is requisite either that he
speak with her;

It is moved this way or that way with a small weight.

P. Who is this that talks here?
Mysis, God save you.

M. God save you Pamphilus.

P. How does she?

M. Do you ask?
She is in hard labor, and the poor woman is troubled about this, this
Because the marriage was appointed a good while since against day, and besides
she is afraid of this,


P. What? Can I find in my heart to do that?
Should I suffer her poor woman to be deceived through me,
Who committed her mind and all her life to me;
Whom I most entirely loved, as if she had been my wife,
Shall I suffer her good nature that was well and orderly brought up,

I will not do it.

M. I do not fear it, if it were in your power only.
But I fear you cannot be able to abide the blunt.

P. Do you think me so base-minded,
And withal so ungrateful, or unmanly, or like a beast,
That neither acquaintance, nor love, nor shame


M. This one thing I know, that she has deserved, that you should be mindful
of her.

P. That I should be mindful! O Mysis, Mysis, those words of Chrysis
Concerning Glycerie are even at this time printed in my mind;
When she was just ready to give up the ghost, she called me,

O my Pamphilus, you see this woman's beauty and age,
Neither are you to be told, how inconvenient both things are to her,
Both to preserve her honesty, and her estate.
And therefore I entreat you by this right hand of yours, and your good nature,

That you would not part her from you, nor for sake her:
If I have loved you, as if you had been mine own brother,
Or she has valued you alone above all men in the world,
Or was in all things ready to observe your commands:

I commit these our goods to you, and deliver them to your trust.
She delivered her to me into my hand: death presently seized upon her.
I took her, I will keep her now I have taken her.

M. I hope no less.

P. But why do you go away from her?

M. I am going for the Midwife.

P.
About the marriage; lest this also should increase her grief.

M. I understand you.

Act. I. Scen. V.
Pamphilus, Mysis. P. HOccine est humanum factum, aut incoeptum? hoccine est
Officium patris?

Mys. Quid illud est?

P. Pro Deum fidem atque hominum,
Quid est, si haec non contumelia est? Uxorem decreverat
Dare sese mihi hodie. Nonne oportuit praescisse me ante? nonne prius,


M. Miseram me! quod verbum audio?

P. Quid Chremes? qui denegarat se commissurum mihi
Gnatam suam uxorem, id mutavit, quoniam me immutatum vide:
Itane obstinatc operam dat, ut me a Glycerio miserum
Abstrahat. Quid si fit, pereo funditus. Adeon' hominem

Pro Deum atque hominum fidem! nullone ego Chremetis pacto
Affinitatem effugere poteto? Quot modis contemptus, spretus?
Facta transacta omnia. Hem! repudiatus repetor.
Quamobrem? nisi id est quod suspicor; Aliquid monstri alunt.


M. Oration haec
Me miseram exanimavit metu.

P. Nam quid ego dicam de patre? at
Tantamne rem tam negligenter agere (...) praeteriens modo mihi
Apud forum, Uxor tibi ducenda est Pamphile hodie, inquit, para,
Abi domum. Id mihi visus est dicere, Abi cito, and suspende te.

Aut ullam causam, ineptam saltem, falsam, iniquam? obmutui.
Quod si ego tescissem id prius, quid facerem, si quis nunc me roger,
Aliquid facerem, ut hoc ne facerem. Sed nunc quid primum exequar?
Tot me impediunt curae, quae meum animum diverse trahunt.

Tum patris pudor, qui me tam leni passus est animo usque adhuc
Quae meo cunque libitum est animo facere; eine ego ut adverser,
Hei mihi! incertum est quid agam.

M. Misera timeo, incertum hoc
Quorsum accidat. Sed nunc peropus est, aut hunc cum ipsa, aut aliquid

Paulo momento huc vel illuc impellitur.

P. Quis hic loquitur?
Mysis, salve.

M. O salve, Pamphile.

P, Quid agit?

M. Rogas?
Laborat e dolor, atque ex hoc misera, sollicita est, diem
Quia olim in hunc constitutae nuptiae; tum autem hoc timet,


P. Hem! egone istuc conari queam!
Egon' propter me illam decipi miseram sinam?
Quae mihi suum animum atque omnem vitam credidit;
Quam ego animo egregie charam pro uxore habuerim,
Been and pudice ejus doctum atque eductum, sinam

Non faciam.

M. Haud vereor, si in te solo sit situm;
Sed vim ut queas far.

P. Adeon' me ignavum putas,
Adeon' porro ingratum, aut inhumanum, aut ferum,
Ut neque consuetudo, neque amor, neque pudor


M. Unum hoc scio, hanc meritam esse, ut memor esses sui.

P. Memor essem! O Mysis, Mysis, etiam nunc mihi
Scripta illa dicta sunt in animo Chrysidis,
De Glycerio. Jam ferme moriens, me vocat:

Mi Pamphile, hujus formam atque aetatem vides;
Nec clam te est, quam illi nunc utraeque res inutiles
Et ad pudicitiam and ad rem tutandam sient.
Quod ego te per hanc dextram oro, and ingenium tuum,

Te obtestor, ne abs te hanc segreges, neu descras;
Si te in germani fratris dilexi loco,
Sive haec te solum semper fecit maximi,
Seu tibi morigera fuit in rebus omnibus:

Bona nostra haec tibi committo, and tuae mando fidei.
Hanc mihi in manum dat: mors continuo ipsam occupat.
Accepi, acceptam servabo.

M. Ita spero quidem.

P. Sed cur tu abis ab illa?

M. Obstetricem accerso.

P.
De nuptiis; ne ad morbum hoc etiam.

M. Teneo.

Act. II. Scene I.
Charinus, Byrrhia, Pamphilus. Chapter What say you Byrrhia? Is she to be married
to Pamphilus to day?

B. Yes.

Chapter How know you Byrrhia?

B. I heard it of Daus now at the market.

Chapter Woe is me poor man.
As my mind bath been always held heretofore betwixt hope and fear, So, since
hope is taken away, being wenry and spent with care, it is dismayed.

B. I pray your heartily Charinus, seeing that cannot be done which you desire,
That you would desire what may be done.

Chapter I would have nothing but Philumena.

B. Alas, how much better were it for you to strive to remove this love
Out of your mind, than to utter that whereby your desire is kindled
More in vain.

Chapter We can all lightly when we are well,
Give good advice to such as are sick. If you were in my case, you would think
otherwise.

B. Go to, go to:
Do as you list.

Chapter But I see Pamphilus. I am resolved to try all means rather than perish.

B. What does he do?

Chapter I will entreat him, I will beseech him, I will
Discover my love to him, I think I shall prevail that he would put off the
marriage at least a few days.
In the mean time, I hope something will be done.

B. That something is nothing.

Chapter Byrrhia,
What do you think of it? Had I best go to him?

B. What else? if that you may get nothing,
Yet that he may think you are ready to cuckoldize him, if he marry her.

Chapter Get you hence, you rogue, with a mischief, with that ill thought of thine.

P. I see Charinus. God save you.

Chapter O, God save you Pamphilus.
I come to you requesting hope, safety, help and advice.

P. Truly I am not able to give you counsel, neither can I help you.
But what is that you desire?

Chapter Are you to be married to day?

P. So they say.

Chapter Pamphilus, if you do so, you shall never see my face after to day.

P. Why so?

Chapter Woe is me, I am loath to tell you; I pray thee Byrrhia, tell him:

B. I will tell you.

P. What is it?

B. He is in love with your Bride.

P. Truly he is not of
My mind. Come hither and tell me Charinus, had you any thing more to do with
her.

Chapter Alas, Pamphilus, nothing.

P. I wish you had.

Chapter Now
I entreat your for our friendship and loves sake, first and foremost, that you
would not marry her.

P. Truly I will do my endeavor.

Chapter But if you cannot avoid it, or that
This marriage be according to your heart.

P. My heart?

Chapter Put it off at least for a few days, whilst I go
Somewhither, that I may not see it.

P. Do but hear now; Charinus, I in no wise hold it
To be the part of an honest man, to desire thanks to be given him
When he deserves none. I am more more desirous to be rid of this marriage,
then you are to obtain it.

Chapter You have revived my spirit.

P. Now if you can do any thing your self, or this Byrrhia,
Do it, faign it, find it out, bring it abe ut, how she may be given you.
I will handle the matter, as she may not be given to me.

Chapter I have enough.

P. I sec Davus in very good time,
Whose advice I rely upon.

Chapter But you forsooth can tell me nothing,
Except such things as are not worth the knowing. Can you be gone?

B. I will be gone truly, and with all my heart.

Act. II. Scen. I.
Charinus, Byrrhia, Pamphilus. Chapter QUid ais, Byrrhia? Daturne illa Pamphilo
hodie nuptum?

B. Sic est.

Chapter Qui scis, Byrrhia?

B. Apud forum modo de Davo audivi.

Chapter Vae misero mihi.
Ut animus in spe atque in timore usque antehac attentus fuit,
Ita, postquam adempta spes est, lassus, cura confectus stupet.

B.
Id velis quod possit.

Chapter Nihil volo aliud nifi Philumenam.

B. Ah, quanto satius est, te id dare operam, qui istum amorem
Ex animo amoveas tuo, quam id loqui, quo magis libido
Frustra incendatur tua.

Chapter Facile omnes cum valemus, recta


B. Age, age,
Ut lubet.

Chapter Sed Pamphilum video. Omnia experiri certum est, prius, quam pereo.

B. Quid hic agit?

Chapter Ipsum hunc orabo, huic supplicabo, amorem
Huic narrabo meum. Credo impetrabo, ut aliquot saltem nuptiis protrahat dies.
Interea fiet aliquid, spero.

B. Id aliquid nihil est.

Chapter Byrrhia,


B. Quid ni? si nihil ut impetres,
Ut te arbitretur sibi paratum maechum, si illam duxerit.

Chapter Abi hinc in malam rem cum suspitione isthac, scelus.

P. Charinum video. Salve.

Chapter O salve, Pamphile.
Ad te venio, spem, salutem, auxilium, consilium expetens.

P.
Sed istuc quidnam est?

Chapter Hodie uxorem ducis?

P. Ita aiunt.

Chapter Pamphile, si id facis, hodie postremum me vides.

P. Quid ita?

Chapter Hei mihi, vereor dicere; huic dic quaeso, Byrrhia.

B. Ego dicam.

P. Quid est?

B. Sponsam hic tuam amat.

P. Nae iste haud mecum

Charine?

Chapter Aha, Pamphile, nihil.

P. Quam vellem.

Chapter Nunc
Te per amicitiam, and per amorem obsecro, principio, ut ne ducas.

P. Dabo equidem operam.

Chapter Sed si id non potes, aut tibi nuptiae
Hae sunt cordi.

P. Cordi?

Chapter Saltem aliquot dies profer, dum proficiscor


P. Audi nunc jam: Ego, Charine, neutiquam officium
Liberi esse hominis puto, cum is nihil promereat, postulare id gratiae
Apponi fibi: nuptias effugere ego istas malo, quam tu adipiscier.

Chapter Reddidisti animum.

P. Nunc si quid potes aut tu, aut hic Byrrhia,
Facite, fingite, invenite, efficite, qui detur tibi:


Chapter Sat habeo.

P. Davum optime
Video, cujus consilio fretus sum.

Chapter At tu hercle haud quicquam mihi,
Nisi ea quae nihil opus sunt scire. Fugin' hinc?

B. Ego vero ac lubens.

Act II. Scen. II.
Davus, Charinus, Pamphilus. D. GOod God! what good news do I bring? but where
shall I find Pamphilus,
That I may now rid him of the fear he is in, and fill his heart with joy?

Chapter He is merry, I know not for what.

P. There is no cause, he has not yet understood these mischiefs.

D. Whom I verily believe, if he has already heard that a match is provided
for him.

Chapter Do you hear him, or no?

D. That like a man distracted, he is seeking me all the town over:
But where shall I seek him? whither shall I now go first?

Chapter Do you forhear to speak to him.

D. I am gone.

P. Davus, come hither; tarry.

D. What man is that, that calls me? O Pamphilus,
You are the man I look for. O brave, O Charinus, both in good time! you are
the men I desire to speak withal.

P. Davus, I am undone.

D. But hear me this.

P. I am quite undone.

Chapter Truly my life is in danger.

D. And I know too what you fear.

P. A marriage is provided me.

D. Although I know it.

P. To day.

D. You weary me with your words, though I understand it,
You fear this, lest you should marry Philumena; and you, left you should not
marry her.

Chapter You hit the nail on the head.

P. That same is it.

D. But that same, it has no danger in it, I warrant you.

P. I pray you rid me poor man out of this fear as so on as may be.

D. Look you,
I do rid you: Chremes will not now bestow a wise on you.

P. How know you?

D. I know.
Your Father caught hold of me erewhile; he said he would help you to a wife
To day, And many other things, which it is now no time to talk of.
I presently hasted, and ran quite to the market place, to tell you these
things:
When I could not find you, I got up there into an high place;
I look round about; you were nowhere to be seen. By chance I espied this man's
servant Byrrhia:
I asked him for you; he said he did not see you: This troubled me: I bethink
me what to do.
In the mean time, as I came back, I began to mistrust from the very matter;
ho,
A small provision; he himself is sad: a marriage all on a sudden!
These things do not hang together.

P. What of all this?

D. I presently went to Chremes house.
When I came thither, there was no body about the door, I was now glad of that.

Chapter You say well.

P. Go on.

D. I tarry there; in the mean time I see no body
Go in, I see no body come forth; I see no elderly woman, in the house
There was no decking it up; no rushing at all: I went nearer, and peeped in.

P. I know
This is a great sign.

D. Do these things seem to agree with a marriage?
I think no, Davus.

D. Do you say, I think? You mistake the matter:
It is sure enough. Moreover as I was coming thence, I met Chreme's boy,
Carrying pot herbs, and a half pennyworth of small fish for the oldmans
supper.

Chapter Davus, I am acquitted by your means to day.

D. But never a jot.

Chapter Why so? Surely Chremes will not give her at all to him.

D. You Cox-comb:
As though it must needs follow, if he give her not to him, that you must marry
her.
Unless you look about you, unless you entreat the old man's friends, you go
about the bush.

Chapter You advise me well;
I will go, though indeed this hope has already failed me often; farewell.

Pamphilum?
Ut metum in quo est nure, adimam, atque expleam animum gaudio?

P. Nihil est, nondum haec rescivit mala.

D. Quem ego nunc credo si jam audierit sibi paratas nuptias.

D. Toto me oppido exanimatum quaerere.
Sed ubi quaeram? quo nunc primum intendam?

P. Obsecro te, quamprimum hoc me libera miserum metu.

D. Hem,


P. Qui scis?

D. Scio.
Tuus pater modo me apprehendit; ait tibi uxorem dare sese
Hodie. Item alia multa, quae nunc non est narrandi locus.
Continuo at te properans, procurro ad forum, ut dicam tibi haec.
Ubi te non invenio, ibi ascendo in quendam excelsum locum,

Rogo: negat vidisse. Mihi molestum; quid agam, cogito.
Redeunti interea ex ipsa re mihi incidit suspicio, hem,
Paululum obsonii: ipsus tristis: de improviso nuptiae:
Non cohaerent.

P. Quorsum nam istuc:

D. Ego me continuo ad Chremem.


Chapter Recte dicis.

P. Perge.

D. Maneo: interea introire neminem
Video, exire neminem; matronam nullam, in aedibus
Nihil ornati; nihil tumulti: accessi, introspexi.

P. Scio,
Magnum signum.

D. Number videntur convenire haec nuptiis?

Chapter

D. Opinor, narras? non recte accipis:
Certa res est. Etiam puerum inde abiens conveni Chremis;
Olera and pisculos minutos ferr^obolo in coenam senis.

Chapter Liberatus sum, Dave, hodie tua opera.

D. At nullus quidem.

Chapter Quid ita? nempe huic prorsus illam non dat.

D. Ridiculum caput;

Nisi vides, nisi senis amicos oras, ambis.

Chapter Been mones.
Ibo, etsi hercle saepe jam me spes haec frustrata est. Vale.

Act II. Scen. III.
Pamphilus, Davus. P. WHat means my Father then? Why does he dissemble?

D. I will tell you:
If he now be angry, because Chremes does not give you his daughter,
He may seem to himself to have done you wrong, and not without cause,
Before he understand how your mind is inclined toward marriage;
But if you deny to marry her, he will then lay all the blame upon you,
And then there will be an hurle-burle.

P. What? would you have me to endure it?

D. He is your Father, Pamphilus,
It is a hard case. Besides, she is an only woman; he will quickly find
Some occasion, why he may pack her out of the town.

P. Pack her out?

D. Out of hand.

P. Tell me then Davus, what should I do?

D. Say you will marry.

P. Ha.

D. What is the matter?

P. Shall I say so?

D. Why not?

P. I will never do it.

D. Do not say nay.

P. Do not offer to persuade me.

D. Consider what will become of it.

P. That I be
Shut out from Glycerie, and pent up with this woman.

D. It is not so. Verily,
I suppose your Father will thus say to you; I would have you marry a wise to
day:
You shall say, I will marry. Tell me what shall he chide with you for? By this
means you shall make all
His devices which be has now certainly resolved (...), to become uncertain,
Without any danger at all. For this is out of question, that Chremes
Will not give you his daughter; nor should you for this reason forbear
These things which you do, for fear he should alter his mind.
Tell your father you are willing, that when he would rightly be angry with
you, he may not be able.

Bestow a wife upon a man of these conditions. He will find a mean match for
you (say I) rather then suffer you to be spoiled;
But if he perceive you take it contentedly, you may make him careless:
He will seek another for you at his leisure; in the mean time some good may
happen.

P. Do you think so?

D. There is no doubt of it.

P. Have a care,


D. But do you not say what you will do?

P. I will tell him, but a care must be taken,
That he may know I have a child by her, for I have promised,
That I would take it and bring it up.

D. O bold prank!

P. She entreated me
To make her this promise, that she might know I would nor forsake her.

D. A care shall be taken; but your father is here. Beware he see you not sad.

Actus II. Scen. III.
Pamphilus. Davus. P. QUid igitur sibi vult pater? cur simulat?

D. Ego dicam tibi,
Si id succenseat nunc, quia non det tibi uxorem Chremes,
Ipsus sibi videatur esse injurius, neque id injuria,
Prius quam tuum animum ut sese habeat ad nuptias perspexerit.

Tum illae turbae fient.

P. Quid vis, patiar?

D. Pater est, Pamphile;
Difficile est; tum haec sola est mulier; dictum ac factum invenerit
Aliquam causam, quamobrem ejiciat oppido.

P. Ejiciat?

D. Cito.

P. Cedo igitur quid faciam, Dave?

D. Dic te ducturum.

P. Hem!

D. Quid est?

P.

D. Cur non?

P. Nunquam faciam.

D. Ne nega.

P. Suadere noli.

D. Ex ea re quid fiat, vide.

P. Ut ab illa
Excludar, hac concludar.

D. Non ita est; nempe hoc
Sic esse opinor dicturum patrem: Ducas volo hodie uxorem.
Tu, ducam, inquies. Cedo quid jurgabit tecum? hic redde^ omnia

Sine omni periculo. Nam hoc haud dubium est, quin Chremes
Tibi non det gnatam: nec tu ea causa minueris
Haec quae facis, ne is suam mutet sententiam.
Patri dic velle te; ut cum velit tibi jure irasci, non quear.

Dabit nemo. Inveniet inopem, potius quam te corrumpi sinat.
Sed si te aequo animo far accipiat, negligentem feceris;
Aliam otiosus quaeret; interea aliquid acciderit boni.

P. Itane credis?

D. Haud dubium id quidem est.

P. Vide,


D. Quin taces?

P. Dicam, puerum autem
Ne resciscat mihi esse ex illa, cautio est; nam pollicitus sum
Susceprurum.

D. O facinus audax.

P. Hanc fidem sibi
Me obsecravit, qui se sciret non deserturum, ut darem.

D. Curabitur; sed pater adest. Cave ne te tristem esse sentiat.

Act. II. Scene 4.
Simo. Davus. Pamphilus. S. I Come again to see what they do, or what they are
consulting.

D. He now makes no doubt, but that you will refuse to marry.
He has been studying somewhere by himself, and is come out of a bycorner;
He hops he has got something to say, whereby he may baffle you;


P. I will do as well as I can, Davus.

D. Pamphilus, believe me, I say, in this; that your father
Will not exchange one word with you to day
If you will but say you will marry.

Act. II. Scen. 4.
Simo. Davus. Pamphilus. S. REviso quid agant, aut quid captent consilii.

D. Hic nunc non dubitat, quin te ducturum neges;
Venit meditatus alicunde ex solo loco:
Orationem sperat invenisse, qua differat te;


P. Modo ut possim, Dave.

D. Creed inquam hoc mihi, Pamphile; nunquam hodie
Tecum commutaturum patrem
Unum esse verbum, si te dices d^cere.

Act. II. Scene 5.
Byrrhia. Simo. Davus. Pamphilus. B. MY master commanded me, that setting all
business aside to day,
I should watch Pamphilus, that I might know what he did about the marriage,
And therefore I follow him now as he comes hither.
I see him just here at hand with Davus. I will mind this business.

S.

D. How, look about you.

S. Pamphilus.

D. Look at him, as if you were not aware of him.

P. Oh Father.

D. Well done.

S. I would have you marry a wife to day, as I told you.

D. Now I am afraid of our side, what answer this man may make.

P. You shall find no let in me either in this or any thing else.

B. How now!

D.

B. What said he?

S. You do as becomes you.
Forasmuch as I obtain with a good will, that which I desire of you.

D. Am not I a true man?

B. My master, as far as I hear, is fallen short of his wife.

S. Go thy way in now, lest you make them tarry for you, when need is.

P. I am going.

B. That there should be no trust to be had in any man for any thing!

Every man wishes better to himself, then to another.
I have seen that maid, and me thinks I see her yet,
How she is of a lovely feature. Therefore I think the better of Pamphilus,
If he chose rather to sleep with her in his arms himself, then that Charinus
should do so.


Act. II. Scen. 5.
Byrrhia. Simo. Davus. Pamphilus. B. HErus me, relictis rebus, juflit Pamphilum
hodie
Observare ut quid ageret de nuptiis,
Scirem. Id propterea nunc huc venientem sequor.
Ipsum adeo praesto video cum Davo. Hoc agam.

S.

D. Hem, serva.

S. Pamphile.

D. Quasi de improviso respice ad cum.

P. Ehem pater!

D. Probe.

S. Hodie uxorem ducas, ut dixi, volo.

D. Nunc nostrae timeo parti, quid hic respondeat.

P. Neque istic neque alibi tibi erit usquam in me mora.

B. Hem!

D.

B. Quid dixit?

S. Facis ut te decet:
Cum istuc quod postulo, impetro cum gratia.

D. Sum verus?

B. Herus, quantum audio, uxore decidit.

S. I nunc jam intro, ne in mora, cum opus sit, sies.

P. Eo.

B. Nullane in re esse homini cuiquam fidem!

Omnes sibi malle melius esse, quam alteri.
Ego illam vidi virginem: forma bona
Memini videre, quo aequior sum Pamphilo,
Si se illam in somnis, quam illum amplecti maluit.


Act. II. Scene 6.
DAVUS. SIMO. D. THis man now think's that I bring some tricks to deceive you,
And that I have tarried here for that purpose.

S. What says Davus?

D. As much now as I did before.

S. Nothing, ha.

D. Nothing at all.

S. But indeed I expected you would say something.

D.

S. Can you tell me the truth?

D. Nothing more readily.

S. Does this marriage any whit at all trouble him,
In respect of his familiarity with this strange woman?

D. Not a jot indeed: or if it do so, this dumpishness will but be

For he has very well considered the matter with himself.

S. I commend him.

D. Whilst it was lawful for hin, and his age permitted,
He minded love matters, and that but privately; he had a care that that matter
Should never bring him any disgrace, as it becomes a Gentleman to do.


S. He seemed to me to look somewhat heavily on it.

D. Not a whit for this matter; but there is something that he is not well
pleased with you for.

S. What is it?

D. It is but a childish business.

S. What is it?

D. Nothing.

S. But tell me what it is?

D. He says you are too sparing in your cost.

S. What I!

D. Yes you.

Which of my Companions shall I invite to my supper?
Especially now: and that which may be here spoken betwixt you and me,
You deal too too nigardly, I do not commend you.

S. Hold your peace.

D. I have vex't his patience.

S. I will see that those things be done as they should be.

For if there be any mischief here, to be sure, he is the author of it.

Act. II. Scene 6.
Davus. Simo. D. HIc nunc me credit aliquam sibi fallaciam
Portare, and ea me hic restitisse gra^.

S. Quid Davus narrat? D. Aeque quicquam nunc quidem.

S. Nihi ne, hem?

D. Nihil prorsus. S. Atqui expectabam quidem.

D.

S. Poresne mihi verum dicere?

D. Nihil facilius.

S. Number illi molesiae quippiam hae sunt nuptiae,
Propter hujusce hospitae consuetudinem?

D. Nihil hercle: aut si adeo, bidui aut tridui est

Etenim secum ipse eam rem recta reputavit via,

S. Laudo.

D. Dum licitum est ei, dumque aetas tulit,
Amavit, tum id clam, cavit ne unquam infamiae
Ea res sibi esset, ut virum fortem decer.


S. Subtristis visus est esse aliquantum mihi.

D. Nihil propter hanc rem; sed est quod succenseat tibi.

S. Quidnam est?

D. Puerile est.

S. Quid est?

D. Nihil.

S. Quin dic quid est?

D. Ait nimium parce facere sumptum.

S. Mean?

D. Te.

Quem inquit, vocabo ad coenam meorum aequalium
Potissimum nunc? and quod dicendum hic siet,
Tu quoque perperce nimium, non laudo.

S. Tace.

D. Commovi animum.

S. Ego istaec recte ut fiant videro.

Nam si hic mali est quicquam, hem illic est huic rei caput.

Act III. Scen. 1.
Mysis, Simo, Davus, Lesbia, Glyceriuna. M. IN troth it is just as you said,
Lesbia:
One shall very hardly find a man that is true to a woman.

S. This maid belongs to the Andrian woman. What say you?

D. Yes.

M. But this Pamphilus.

S. What says he?

M. Has made his word good.

S. What?

D.

M. For he gave order it should be put to Nurse, what ever she was delivered on.

S. O Jupiter,
What Is this I hear? the matter is past remedy, if she speak the truth.

L. You show him to be a good natured young man.

M. Passing good;
But follow me, lest you make her stay for you.

L. I follow you.

D.

S. What means this?
Is he so mad, as to have a child by a strange woman? now I understand the
matter: ah!
That much ado to find it out all this while, like a blockhead that I am:

D. What does he say he has found out?

S. This fellow first offers to put this ^navish trick upon me.
They make as though this woman was brought abed, that may fright Chremes.

Gl. Juno Lucina help me, save me, I beseech thee.

S. Whoo, so quickly? a fond device. After she heard that I stood
Before the door, she makes have; O Davus, these things
Were not well enough contrived by you according to their times.

D. By me?

S. You have not forgot your Scholar.

D. I know not what you say.

S.
In a real marriage, what pranks would he have played me?
Now it is done upon his peril, I sail in a safe harbor.

Act. III. Scen. 1.
Mysis, Simo, Davus, Lesbia, Glycerium. M. IT a pol quidem res est ut dixti,
Lesbia:
Fidelem haud ferme mulieri invenies virum.

S. Ab Andria an illa est haec. Quid narras?

D. Ita est.

M. Sed hic Pamphilus.

S. Quid dicit?

M. Firmavit fidem.

S. Hem?

D

M. Nam quod peperisset, jussit rolli.

S. O Jupiter,
Quid ego audio! actum est, siquidem haec vera praed cat.

L. Bonum ingenium narras adole scentis.

M. Optimum.
Sed sequere me intio, ne in mola illi sis.

L. Sequor.

D.

S. Quid hoc?
Adcon' est demens? experegrina? jam scio, ah!
Vix tandem sensi stolidus.

D. Quid hic sensisse ait?

S. Haec primum affertur jam mihi ab hoc fallacia.
Hanc simulant parere, quo Chremetem absterreant.

Gl.

S. Hui, tam cito? Rid culum. Postquam ante ostium
Me audivit stare, approperat; non sat commode
Divisa sunt temporibus tibi, Dave, haec.

D. Mih^n'?

S. Non immemor es discipuli.

D. Ego quid narres, nescio.

S.
Adortus esset, quos mihi ludos redderet?
Nunc hujus pericuolo fit, Ego navigo in portu.

Act III. Scen. 2.
Lesbia, Simo, Davus. L. ARchillis, I see hitherto she has all signs of health
Which are usual and ought to be to a woman in her case.
Now first and foremost see that she wash; and then afterward
Give her that to drink which I appointed, and give her as much as I had you:
Pamphilus
Has a jolly chopping boy born him. I pray God be may be long-lived, seeing
He is such a good natured man, and seeing he was loath
To offer any wrong to this very good young woman.

S. Now who that knows thee, would not think this to be a trick of thy
devising?

D.

S. She could not give order face to face, for what was fit
To be done to one in childbed; but after she is come forth, she calls out
From the strect-way to them that are within-doors. O Davus, am I so slighted
by you?
Or do I seem at last to be so fit a man for you, as that you should begin so
openly
To put tricks upon me? You might at least have carried it more handsomely,


D. Certainly forsooth
This man now cosens himself, not I.

S, Did not I tell you?
I charged you, you should not do it. Did you stand in awe of me? What good
has it done thee?
Do I now believe thee this, that this womon is brought in bed of a child by
Pamphilus?

D. I perceive wherein he is mistaken, and I know what to do.

S. Why do you not speak?

D.

S. Did any body tell me?

D, What then, did you your self find out that this was feigned?

S. Am I made a fool on?

D. Some body told you, for how could you come to suspect it?

S. How? because I knew thee.

D. As if he should say that was done by my device.

S. For I am sure of it.

D. Simo, You do not sufficiently know me yet what a man I am.

S.

D. But if I begin to tell you any thing, you presently
Suppose I go about to cosen you.

S. Unjustly.

D. And therefore I dare not open my lips.

S. This one thing I am sure on, that no woman is brought abed here.

D. Have you understood so much?
Yet nevertheless they will bring a child hither before the door.
Master, I now tell you that it will come to pass, that you may know it,
Davus's counsel or craft,
I would have this ill opinion which you have of me to be quite taken away.

S. How do you know it?

D. I heard it, and I believe it. Many things withal concur, which cause me to
guess thus. She now has said first that she was with child
By Pamphilus; it is a false thing invented; and now after that she sees

Was sent to fetch a Midwife to her, and to bring a child withal.
Unless it come to pass that you see the child, the marriage is not hindered.

S. What say you? when you perceived they plotted such a thing, why did you not
forthwith tell
Pamphilus?

D. Why then who else withdrew him from her; but I?

Now he desires he may have a wife; to conclude, let me alone with the matter,
and do you nevertheless
Go on to make up this match as you do, and hope God will prosper you.

S. Well then, go thou in a door, and there tarry for me, and provide what is
fitting to be provided.
He has not enforced me wholly to believe these things, and yet I know not

Which my son has promised me. Now will I meet Chremes, and entreat
For a wife for my son; if I prevail; what should I desire else, but
That the marriage may be to day? for if my son will not do what
He has promised, I make no question but I can force him to it;
And look where Chremes himself comes toward me in the very nick of time.

Actus 3. Scen. 2.
Lesbia, Simo, Davus. L. ADhuc, Archillis, quae adsolent, quaeque oportent
Signa esse ad salutem, omnia huic esse video.
Nunc primum fac istaec ut lavet: post deinde
Quod jussi, ei date bibere, and quantum imperavi, date.

Pamphilo. Deos quaeso, ut sit superstes, quandoquidem
Ipse est ingenio bono, cumque huic veritus est
Optumae adolescenti facere injuriam.

S. Vel hoc quis non credat, quite norit, abs te esse ortum?

D.

S. Non imperabat coram quid opus facto esset
Puerperae; sed postquam egressa est, illis, quae sunt intus clamat
De via. O Dave, itane contemnor abs te, aut itane
Tandem idoneus tibi videar esse, quem tu aperte
Fallere incipias dolis? Saltem accurate, ut metui


D. Certe hercle
Nunc ipsus se fallit, haud ego.

S. Dixin'tibi?
Interminatus sum, ne faceres: number veritus? quid retulit?
Credon' tibi hoc nunc, peperisse hanc e Pamphilo?

D. Teneo quid erret; and quid agam, habeo.

S. Quid taces?

D.

S. Mihin' quisquam?

D. Eho, an tute intellexti hoc adsimularier?

S. Irrideor?

D. Renunciatum est; nam qui istaec incidit tibi suspitio?

S. Qui? quia te noram.

D. Quasi tu dicas, factum id consilio meo.

S. Certe enim scio.

D. Non satis me pernosti etiam qualis sim, Simo.

S.

D. Sed si quid tibi narrare cepi, continuo dari
Tibi verba censes.

S. Falso.

D. Iraque hercle nihil mutire jam. audeo.

S. Hoc ego scio unum, neminem peperisse hic.

D. Intellextin'?
Sed nihilo secius puerum deferent huc ante ostium.
Id ego nunc tibi, here, renuncio futurum, ut sis sciens:

Prorsus a me opinionem tuam esse ego amotam volo.

S. Unde id scis?

D. Audivi and credo. Multa concurrunt simul,
Qui conjecturam nunc hanc facio. Jam prius haec se e Pamphilo
Gravidam dixit esse; inventum est falsum: nunc postquam videt

Obstetricem accersitum ad eam, and puerum ut asserat simul:
Hoc nisi fit, puerum ut tu videas, nihil moventur nuptiae.

S. Quid ais? cum intellexeras id consilii capere, cur non dixti extemplo
Pamphilo?

D. Quis igitur eum ab illa abstraxit nisi ego?

Uxorem expetit; postremo id mihi da negotii, tu tamen has
Nuptias perge facere, ita ut facis, and id spero adjuturos deos.

S. Imo, abi intro; ibi me operire, and quod parato opus est, para.
Non impulit me haec omnino ut crederem, atque haud scio

Quod mihi pollicitus est ipse gnatus. Nunc Chremetem co^^eniam, orabo
Gnato uxorem si impetro, quid alias malim, quam hodie fiori
Has nuptias? nam gnatus quod pollicitus est, haud dubium id mihi;
Si nolit, quin eum merito possim cogere;


Act. III. Scene 3.
Simo. Chremes. S. I Bid you good marrow Chremes.

C. O you are the man I sought for.

S. And I for you.

C. You come at a wish: There were some came to me
Who said they heard it from you, that my daughter should be married
To your son to day; I come to see whether you or they be out of your wits.


C. I hear you. Speak what you have a mind to say.

S. I entreat you for Gods sake, and for our friendship, Chremes,
Which begun when we were little ones, and has grown up together with our age;
And for your only daughters sake, and my sons sake,

That you would help me in this matter, and like as
The marriage should have been, so that it may be made.

C. Ah, do not entreat me;
As though you must obtain this of me by entreating.
You take me to be another kind of man now, then heretofore, when I promised
her.

But if there be more harm then good in this matter
To both, I entreat you to consult for the good of all parties,
As if she were your daughter, and I Pamphilus's father.

S* Yea Chremes so I mean, and desire that it may be so effected.


C. What is it?

S. There is a falling out betwixt Glycerie and my son.

C. I hear you.

S. So great that I hope they may be parted.

C. These are but tales.

S. Truly it is so.

C. So indeed as I will tell you,
The falling out of lovers is the renewing of love.

S.
And whilst his hot love is stopped by their bitter speeches,
Before these women's rogueries and tears feigned through wiles
Work his weak mind again to compassion of them.
Let us give him a wife; I hope Chremes, that he being engaged by use of
company and honest wedlock,


C. It seems so to you; but I think it cannot be,
That either he should continue with her, or that I should abide it.

S. How then do you know that, before you have made trial?

C.

S. Verily, all the worst that can be comes but to this at last,
If it should come to pass, which God forbid, a divorce;
But if he shall be reformed, see how many good things come of it;
First and foremost, you shall restore his son to your friend,


C. What say you so? if you be persuaded that this is so expedient,
I should be loath to hinder you of any good turn I can do you.

S. Chremes, I have for good reason always loved you more then any man

C. But what say you?

S, What?

C. How know you that they are now fallen out


S. Davus himself who is very privy
To their counsels, told me, and he persuades me
To hasten on the marriage as fast as I can. Do you think
He would do it, except be knew my son desire these same things?
Besides you shall hear what he says. Ho,
Davus forth hither. But l^ I see him coming out of doors.

Actus III. Scen. 3.
Simo, Chremes. S. IUbeo Chremetem.

C. O, teipsum quaerebam.

S. Et ego te.

C. Optato advenis. Aliquot adierunt me
Exte auditum, qui aiebant hodie filiam meam
Nubere gnato tuo; id viso, tun' an illi insaniant.

S.
Scies.

C. Ausculto, loquere quid velis.

S. Per ego te Deos oro, and nostram amicitiam, Chreme,
Quae incepta a parvis cum aetate accrevit simul,
Perque unicam gnatam tuam and gnatum meum,

Ut me adjuves in hac re, atque ita, ut nuptiae
Fuerant futurae, fiant.

C. Ah, ne me obsecra,
Quasi hoc te orando imperare a me oporteat.
Alium esse censes nunc me atque olim cum dabam?

Sed si ex ea re plus mali est quam commodi
Utrique; id te oro in commune ut consulas,
Quasi illa tua sit, Pamphilique ego sim pater.

S. Immo ita volo, itaque postulo ut fiat, Cheme,


C. Quid est?

S, Irae sunt inter Glycerium and gnatum.

C. Audio,

S. Ita magnae ut sperem posse avelli.

C. Fabulae.

S. Profecto sic est.

C. Sic hercle ut dicam tibi,
Amantium itae amoris integratio est..

Dumque ejus libido occlusa est contumeliis,
Prius quam harum scelera and lachrymae confictae dolis*
Reducant animum aegrotum ad misericordiam;
Uxorem demus; spero confuetudine and

Dein facile ex illis sese emersurum malis.

C. Tibi ita hoc videtur; at ego non posse arbitror,
Neque illum hanc perpetuo habere, neque me perpeti.

S. Qui scis ergo istuc, nisi periculum feceris?

C.

S. Nempe incommoditas denique huc omnis redit,
Si eveniat, quod dii prohibeant, discessio.
At si corrigetur, quot commoditates vide.
Principio, amico filium restitueris,


C. Quid istuc? si ita istuc animum induxti esse utile,
Nolo tibi ullum commodum in me claudier.

S. Merito te semper maxumi feci, Chreme.

C. Sed quid ais?

S. Quid?

C. Qui scis eos nunc inter se


S. Ipsus mihi Davus, qui intimus est
Eorum consiliis, dixit, and is mihi persuadet
Nuptias quantum queam ut maturem. Number censes
Faceret, filium nisi sciret eadem haec velle?
Tute adeo jam ejus audies verba. Heus,


Act. III. Scene 4.
Davus, Simo, Chremes. D. I Was coming to you.

S. What is the matter?

D. Why is not the Bride sent for?
It draws toward night already.

S. Do you hear him, Davus! I was erewhile
Something afraid of you, lest you should do as the common sort of servants
Are wont, that you deceive me by knavish tricks, because my son is in love.

D.

S. I thought so, and therefore fearing it
I concealed from you, that which I will now tell you.

D. What is it?

S. You shall know, for I dare now
Almost trust you.

D. Do you know at last what a man I am?

S. This marriage was not to have been.

D. What not?

S. But I dissembled for this reason, that I might try you.

D. What say you?

S. It is just so.

D.

S. Hear me this, As soon as I bade you go in hence, this man
Met me very fitly.

D. What are we quite undone?

S. I told him those things
Which you told me erewhile.

D. What do I hear?

S. I entreat him
To bestow his daughter, and with much ado I prevailed.

D. I am undone.

S. How now, what said you?

D.

S. Now there is no stop in him.

C. I will go home now, and bid things be got ready, and bring word hither
again.
Now Davus, I entreat you, seeing thou alone have brought this marriage to pass
for me.

D. I alone indeed.

S. Endeavor a little further to reform my son.

D. Truly I will do the best I can.

S. You may do it now, whilst he is netled.

D.

S. Do it then; where is be now?

D. It is a marvel if he be not at home.

S. I will go to him, and tell him these same things just as I told you.

D. I am an undone man. What shall hinder me from going straightway
Hence into the house of correction? No entreaty will serve. I have set all out
order.
I have deceived my master, I have thrown my masters son on a marriage,
Pamphilus's mind. Fie upon
Craft! But if I could have been quiet, no harm had happened; but
Lo I see him himself; I wish I had some place here, whence I might throw my
self headlong.

Act. III. Scen. 4.
Davus, Simo, Chre^es. D. A Dre^ibam.

S. Quidnam est?

D. Cur non uxor accersitur?
Jam ad vesperascit.

S. Audin' tu illum? Ego dudum nonnihil
Veritus sum, Dave, abste, ne faceres idem quod vulgus servorum
Solet, dolis ut me deluderes, propterea quod amat filius.

D.

Sim. Credidi, idque adeo metuens
Vos celavi, quod nunc dicam.

D. Quid?

S. Scies, nam propemodum
Habeo tibi jam fidem.

D. Tandem cognovisti qui siem?

S. Non fuerunt nuptiae futurae.

D. Quid non?

S. Sed ea gratia
Simulavi, vos ut pertentarem.

D. Quid ais?

S. Sic res est.

D.
Callidum!

S. Hoc audi. Ut hinc te introire jussi, opportune
Hic fit mihi obviam.

D. Hem, numnam perimus?

S. Narro huic quae tu
Dudum narrasti mihi.

D. Quidnam audio?

S. Gnatam ut det,
Oro, vixque id exoro.

D. Occidi.

S. Hem, quid dixisti?

D.

S. Nunc per hunc nulla est mora.

C. Domum modo ibo; ut apparentur dicam, atque huc renuncio

S. Nunce te oro, Dave, quum solus mihi effecisti has nuptias.

D. Ego vero solus.

S. Corrigere mihi gnatum pot^o enitere.

D. Faciam hercle sedulo.

S. Potes nune dum animus irritatus est.

D.

S. Age igitur: ubi nunc est ipsus?

D. Mirum, ni domi est.

S. Ibo ad eum, atque eadem haec quae tibi dixi, dicam itidem illi.

D. Nullus sum. Quid causae est, quin hinc in pistrinum recta
Proficiscar via? Nihil preci loci relictum est. Jam perturbavi omnia.
Herum fefelli, in nuptias conjeci herilem filium, Feci hodie

Astutias! quod si quiessem, nihil evenisset mihi; sed eccum ipsum
Video, video; utinam mihi esset aliquid hic, quo nunc me praecipitem darem.

Act III. Scene 5.
Pamphilus, Davus. P. WHere is that Varlet, that has undone me?

D. I am undone.

P. Yet I confess,
This has justly befallen me, because I am so sottish, and so void
Of counsel: O that I should commit my fortunes to a prating slave!
There am I rightly served for my folly: but he shall never go scot-free with
it.

D.

P. For what shall I now say to my father? shall I say I will not marry her,
who have but lately promised to do so?
With what confidence should I dare to do it? Neither do I know
What I should now do with my self.

D. Nor I with my self, and yet I do what I can about it.
I will tell him I will find out some remedy by and by, that I may make this
punishment be delayed.

P.

D. I am seen.

P. Come hither good Sir, what say you?
Do you not see how I poor man am entangled by your advice?

D. But I will rid you by and by.

P. Will you rid me?

D. Yes indeed, Pamphilus.

P. Forsooth as you did lately.

D. Nay, better I hope.

P. Oh, how should I credit you, you rogue? will you recover a matter
Full of trouble, and past help? Alas, what a fellow have I relied on,

Did not I tell you that this would come to pass?

D. You told me.

P. What have you deserved?

D. The gallows.
But if I may but come to my self a little, I will presently find some remedy.

P. Woe is me,
That I have no space to punish thee as I desire,
For this time permits me to look to my self, not to be revenged on you.

Act. III. Scen. 5.
Pamphilus, Davus. P. UBi illie est scelus, qui me perdidit?

D. Perii.

P. Atque hoc
Confiteor jure mihi obtigisse, quandoquidem tam iners, tam nullius
Consilii sum. Servon' fortunas meas me commisisse futili:
Ergo pretium ob stultitiam fero; sed in ultum id nunquam auferet.

D.

P. N^m quid ego nunc dicam patri? negabon' velle me, modo qui sum
Pollicitus ducere? Qua fiducia facere id audeam? nec quid me
Nunc faciam scio.

D. Nec quid de me, atque id ago sedulo.
Dicam aliquid me jam inventurum, ut huic malo aliquam producam


P. Ohe.

D. Visus sum.

P. Ehodum bone vir, quid ais?
Viden' me tuis consiliis miserum impeditum esse.

D. At jam expediam.

P. Expedies?

D. Certe, Pamphile.

P. Nempe ut modo.

D. Immo melius
Spero.

P. Oh, tibi ego ut credam, furcifer? Tu rem impeditam
Et perditam restitues? hem, quo fretus sim, qui me hodie

Dixi esse hoc futurum?

D. Dixti.

P. Quid meritus es?

D. ^rucem.
Sed si paululum ad me redeam, jam aliquid despiciam.

P. Hei mihi,
Cum non habeo spatium ut de te sumam suppilcium ut volo:
Namque hoc tempus praecavere mihi, haud te ulcisci sinit.

Act IV. Scen. 1.
Charinus, Pamphilus, Davus. Chapter IS this a thing to be believed or mentioned,
that so match peevishness
Should be bred in any man, as to delight in mischief, and seek to get His own
commodity by another discommodity? Alas, is it true? Yea, That is the worst
kind of men, who have a little shame now aad then in denying;
Afterward when it is time that their promises should be performed, then
Being forced they have no way but to lay open themselves, and they are loath,
yet the matter drives them to deny.
Then is their speech most shameleless; Who are you? What are you to me?
Why should you desire to have my sweetheart? Do you hear Sir, I am my own next
neighbor: Yet for all this, if you ask,
Where is faith? they are ashamed of nothing. Here where there is need, they
are not afraid; there where is no
Need, they are afraid: But what should I do? Should I go to him
And take him up for this injury? I shall give him many shrewd words, But may
some body say,
You will do no good: I shall be sure to trouble him sufficiently
And ease my own mind.

P. Charinus, I have undone you and my self unawares,
Except God look upon us.

Chapter Yes, forsooth, unawares.
You have got an excuse now at last, you have broke your promise.

P. What now at last?

Chapter Yea you desire to deceive me now with these words.

P. What is the matter?

Chapter After I told you that I was in love with Philumena, she pleased you. Woe is
me poor man,
Who esteemed your mind by my own.

P. You are mistaken.

Chapter Did not this
Joy seem to you solid enough, except you must call me on being in love, (...).
And draw me on with vain hope? You may take her.

P. I take her? (...) as you know not in what troubles I am, and what cares
this bangman ^mine has wrought me by his projects.

Chapter What is that ^such strange matter, he takes example by you?

P. You would not (...) so,
If you either understood me, or my love.

Chapter I know you chid with your father
Erewhile, and he is angry with you for it, neither could he force you to day
To marry her.

P. Nay indeed, whereby you do not so well apprehend my grief,
This marriage was not intended for me, nor did any man desire now
To give me a wife.

Chapter I know you are compelled by your own will.

P. Tarry,
You do not yet know.

Chapter I know certainly, that you will marry her.

P. Why do you kill me?
Hear me this; he never gave over to urge, to persuade,
And entreat me to tell my father I would marry her, and so far until he
enforced me to it.

Chapter What fellow did that?

P. Davus.

Chapter Davus?

P. He sets all on heaps.

Chapter Why did he so?

P. I know not, except I think God was offended with me;
Because I gave ear to him.

Chapter Did you do this, Davus?

D. I did it.

Chapter Ha, what do you say, you rogue? But God give thee an ill end answerable to
thy doings.
Come on, tell me if all his enemies would have thrown upon a marriage,
What other advice then this, could they give him?

D. I am deceived, but not discouraged.

Chapter I know it.

D. It has no success this way, we will try another way; unless you think
this,
Because it succeeded not well at the first, this mischief cannot
Be remedied.

P. Yes indeed, for I verily believe, if you set your self to it,
You will make me two marriages of one.

D. I, Pamphilus,
Ow you this, as I am your servant, to strive with might and main, night
And day to adventure my life to do you good. It is your part
To pardon me if any thing have happened besides what we looked for. That which I
did, had no good success; yet I do
The best that I can. Or do you find a better remedy, and let me alone.

P. I am content. Set me again in what condition you found me:

D. I will do it.

P. But it must be done presently.

D. Ho, whist, stay a little, Glyceries door creaks.

P. That is nothing to you.

D. I am devising a way.

P. What now at the last?

D. But I will find a device for you by and by.

Actus IV. Scen. 1.
Charinus, Pamphilus, Davus. Chapter HOccine est credibile aut memorabile, tanta
vecordia cuiquam
Innata ut siet, ut malis gaudeat, atque ex incommodis
Alterius sua ut comparet? Ah, idne est verum? Immo
Id est genus hominum pessimum, in denegando modo quis pudor

Necessario se aperiunt, and timent: and tamen res premit eos denegare.
Ibi tum eorum impudentissima oration est. Quis tu es? quis mihi es?
Cur meam tibi? Heus, Proximus sum egomet mihi. Attamen ubi fidis
Si roges? nihil pudet. Hic ubi opus est non verentur: illic ubi nihil

Injuriam hanc expostulem: ingeram multa mala, atque aliquis
Dicat, nihil promoveris. Multum molestus certe ei fuero,
Atque animo morem gessero.

P. Charine, and te and me imprudens
Perdidi, nisi quid dii recipient.

Chapter Itane imprudens?


P. Quid tandem?

Chapter Etiam nunc me ducere his dictis postulas.

P. Quid istuc est?

Chapter Postquam me amare dixi, complacita est tibi. H^u me miserum,
Qui tuum animum spectavi ex animo meo.

P. Falsus es.

Chapter Nonne tibi
Satis esse hoc visum solidum est gaudium, nisi me lact asses amantem,


P. Habeam? ah nescis quantis
In malis verser miser; quanta^que hic suis consiliis mihi
Confecit soilic tudines meus carnifex.

Chapter Quid istuc
Tam mitum est, de te si exemplum capit?

P. Haud istuc dicas,
Si cognoris vel me, vel amorem meum.

Chapter Scio cum patre altercasti.

Illam ut duceres.

P. Immo etiam, quo tu minus scis aerumnas meas,
Hae nuptiae non apparabantur mihi, nec postulabat nunc quisquam
Uxorem dare.

Chapter Scio tu coactus tua voluntate es.

P. Mane.
Nondum scis.

Chapter Scio equidem illam ducturum esse te.

P. Cur me enecas?

Patri, suadere, orare; usque adeo donec perpulit.

Chapter Quis homo
Istuc?

P. Davus.

Chapter Davus?

P. Interturbat omnia.

Chapter Quamobrem?

P. Nescio nisi mihi D^^s satis scio fuisse iratos
Quia auscultaverim.

Chapter Factum hoc est, Dave?

D. Factum.

Eho, dic mihi, si omnes hunc conjectum in nuptias inimici vellent,
Quod nisi hoc, consilium darent?

D. Deceptus sum, at non defatigatus.

Chapter Scio.

D. Hac non succedit; alia aggrediemur via: nisi id putas.
Quia primo processit parum, non posse jam ad salutem converti


P. Immo etiam: nam satis credo, fi advigilaveris,
Ex unis geminas mihi conficies nuptias.

D. Ego, Pamphile,
Hoc tibi pro servitio debeo, conari pedibus and manibus, noctesque and
Dies, capitis periculum adire, dum prosim tibi. Tuum est siquid praeter
S^em evenit, mihi ignoscere. Parum succedit quod ago: at facio


P. Cupio. Restitue quem a me accepisti locum.

D. Faciam.

P. At jam hoc opus est.

D. Hem, 'st, manc: concrepuit a Glycerio ostium.

P. Nihil ad te.

D. Quaero.

P. Nunccine demum?

D. At jam hoc tibi inventum dabo.

Act IV. Scen. 2.
Mysis, Pamphilus, Charinus, Davus. M. WHere ever he shall be, I will take care
to find out your Pamphilus
For you, and bring him with me presently; only my dear, do not vex your self.

P. Mysis.

M. What is the matter?

Chapter Pamphilus, you meet me in very good time.

P. What is the matter?

M. My Mistress
Bade me entreat you, to come to her, if you love her. She says she has a
desire to see you.

P.
Should be thus disquieted now by thy means? For I am therefore sent for,
because she perceives that I am abont to be married. Which indeed how easily
might it have passed quietly,
If this fellow had been quiet?

D. Go to, if he be not mad enough of himself, set him on.

M. And truly that is the cause why the poor woman is in sorrow.

P. Mysis, I swear to you by all the Gods, that I will never forsake her, no
not if I wist
I should ma^e all men living my enemies. I have desired to have her, see it is
fallen to my lot.
Our dispositions are alike; let them be jogging that would make discord
betwixt us.
None but death shall part her from me.

Chapter I begin to come to my self.

P. Apollo's answer is not
More true than this I say, if it may be so carried, that my Father may not

Cannot be, I will go the readiest way to work, though he think I was the cause
to hinder it.
What a man do I seem to be?

Chapter As a very a wretch as my self.

D. I am devising a Plot.

Chapter In other men's matters.

P. I know what you would fain do.

D. Truly, I will be sure to dispatch this for you.

P. This must now be done.

D. But I have it now.

Chapter What is it?

D. I have it for this man, and not for thee:


Chapter I have enough.

P. What will you do? tell me.

D. I am afraid this day will
Scarce be enough for me to do my business, Do not think I am now at leisure to
tell you.
And therefore get you away hence, for you do but hinder me.

P. I will go see her.

D. What do you? whither do you go, hence?

Chapter Would you have me say the truth?

D, Nay forsooth, he begins to tell me a tale of a tub.

Chapter

D. Why you shameless fellow: have you not enough that I gave you
A small days respite, in that I prolong the marriage for him?

Chapter Yet for all this, Davus.

D. What then.

Chapter That I may marry her.

D. You coxcomb.

Chapter See
You come hither to me, if you can do any thing.

D. What should I come for? I can do nothing.

Chapter Nevertheless, if you can do any thing,

D. Well, I will come.

Chapter If you can do any thing I will be at home.

D. Mysis, do you tarry here a little, whilst I come forth again.

M. Why so?

D. You must needs do so.

M. Make haste.

D. I will be here, I say, by and by.

Act. IV. Scene 2.
Mysis, Pamphilus, Charinus, Davus. M. I Am ubi ubi erit, inventum tibi curabo,
and mecum adductum
Tuum Pamphilum: tu modo, anime mi, noli te macerare.

P. Mysis.

M. Quid est? hem Pamphile, optume mihi te offers.

P. Quid est?

M. Orare
Jussit, si se ames, heta, ut ad sese venias. Videre ait te cupere.

P.
Nunc miseros sollicitariet? Nam idcirco accersor, nuptias quia mihi
Apparari sensit.

Chapter Quibus quidem quam facile poterat quiesci,
Si hic qui esset.

D. Age, si hic non insanit satis sua sponte, inst^ga.

M. Atque aedipol ea res est, proptereaque misera in maerore est.

P.
Mihi sciam esse inimicos omnes homines. Hanc mihi expetivi, contigit,
Convenient mores, valiant qui inter nos dissidium volunt.
Hanc nisi mors mihi adimet nemo.

Chapter Resipisco.

P. Non Apollinis
Magis verum atque hoc responsum est. Si poterit fieri ut ne pater pro me

Poterit, id faciam in proclive quod est, per me stetisse ut credat.

P. Quis videor!

Chapter Miseraeque atque ego.

D. Consilium quaero.

Chapter For As.

P. Scio quid conere.

D. Hoc ego tibi profecto effectum reddam.

P. Jam hoc opus est.

D. Quin jam habeo.

Chapter Quid est?

D. Huic, non tibi, habeo.


Chapter Sat habeo.

P. Quid facies, cedo?

D. Dies hic mihi
Ut satis sit vereor ad agendum, ne vacuum esse nunc me ad narrandum,
Credas. Proinde, hinc vos amolimini. Nam impedimento estis.

P. Ego hanc visam.

D. Quid tu? quo hinc te agis?

Chapter Verum vis
Dicam?

D. Immo etiam, narrationis incipit mihi initium,

Chapter

D. Eho tu impudens non satis habes quod tibi
Dieculam addo, quantum huic promoveo nuptias.

Chapter Dave, attamen.

D. Quid ergo?

Chapter Ut ducam.

D. Ridiculum.

Chapter Hoc fac^
Ad me ut venias, si quid poteris.

D. Quid veniam? nihil habeo.

Chapter Attamen si quid.

D. Age, ego veniam.

Chapter Si quid, domi ere.

D. Mysis, dum exeo, parumper me operire hic.

M. Quapropter?

D. Ita facto opus est.

M. Matura.

D. Jam, inquam, adero hic.

Act IV. Scen. 3.
Mysis. M. IS there nothing that one can be sure on? O wonderful strange!
I thought this Pamphilus was my Mistresses greatest comfort,
As being her friend, sweetheart, husband, and one ready to serve her
Upon all occasions: but what pain does the poor woman endure because of him!

But Davus comes forth; my good friend, what is that I pray you?
Whither do you carry the child?

Actus IV. Scen. 3.
Mysis. M. NIhilne esse proprium cuiquam? Dii vestram fidem!
Summum bonum esse herae putavi hunc Pamphilum,
Amicum, amatorem, virum in quovis loco
Paratum: verum ex eo misera quem capit

Sed Davus exit; mi homo, quid istuc obsecro est?
Quo portas puerum?

Act. IV. Scen. 4.
Davus, Mysis. D. MYsis, I have now need
Of your ready feat and cunning for this matter.

M. What are you going to do?

D. Take this child of me quickly,
And lay it before our gate.

M. What I pray you,


D. Take thee some strewing-herbs hence from off this altar,
Amd straw them under it.

M. Why do you not do it your self?

D. Because, if perhaps I be driven to swear to my Master,
Thal I laid it not there, that I may do it safely.

M. I understand you:
But tell me, how came you to be so very scrupulous?

P.
O Jupiter!

M. What now?

D. The Brides farther preventeth me;
I leave off the purpose which I first intended.

M. I know not what you say.

D. I will make as though I came
Here hence on the right hand thee; do you see that you hold up

I do not at all understand what you mean to do; but if there be any thing
Wherein you may stand in need of my help, or you see more then I,
I will tarry, that I may not hinder you in any thing that may do you good.

Act. IV. Scena 4.
Davus, Mysis. D. -- MYsis, nunc opus est tua
Mihi ad hanc rem exprompta militia atque astutia.

M. Quidnam incepturus es?

D. Accipe a me hunc ocyus,
Atque ante nostram januam appone.

M. Obsecro,


D. Ex ara hinc sum verbenas tibi,
Atque eas substerne.

M. Quamobrem id tute non facis?

D. Quia si forte opus sit ad herum jusjurandum mihi,
Non apposuisse, ut liquido possim.

M. Intelligo.
Nova nunc religio in te istaec incessit, cedo.

D.
Pro Jupiter!

M. Quid?

D. Sponsae pater intervenit;
Repudio consilium quod primum intenderam.

M. Nescio quid narres.

D. Ego quoque hinc ab dextra
Venire me adsimulabo; tu, ut subservias

Ego, quid agas, nihil intelligo: sed si quid est
Quod mea opera opus sit vobis, aut tu plus vides,
Manebo, ne quid vestrum remorer commodum.

Actus IV. Scen. 5.
Chremes, Mysis, Davus. Chapter NOw I come back again, after I have provided what
was fitting
For my daughters wedding, that I may bid her be sent for. But what is this?
Verily it is a child.
Woman, did you lay this child here?

M. Where is this fellow?

Chapter Do thou not
Answer me?

M. Alas, he is nowhere to be seen: Woe is me, poor woman!
The man has left me, and is gone away.

D. O wondrous strange!
What an hurly-burly there is in the market? what a sort of men are brabling
there?
Besides provision is dear, I know not what I should say.

M. Why do you leave me here alone, I pray you?

D. How now, what tale is this?
Ey but Mysis, whose is this child? or who brought it hither?

M.

D. Whom else should I ask?
That see no body else here.

Chapter I wonder whose it should be!

D. Will you tell me what I ask you, or not?

M. Ah,

D. Come hither on my right hand.

M. You dote; did not you your self lay it there? you had best take heed
You do not speak one word besides those that I ask you.

M.

D. Whence is it? speak aloud.

M. From us.

D. Ha, ha, he.
It is a wonder indeed if a woman that is a whore deal shamelesly.

Chapter This maid belongs to the woman of Andros, as far as I can perceive.

D. Do we seem to be so fit persons for you to play upon?

Chapter I came in time.

D. Make haste withal to take away the child hence from the gate;


M. A mischief light on thee, thou do so terrify me poor woman.

D. Do I speak to you or no?

M. What would you have?

D. Do you yet stand to ask?
Deal plainly, whose child have you laid here? tell me.

M. Do not you know?

D. Let what I know alone, and tell me what I ask.

M.

D. Whose yours?

M. Pamphilus's.

D. How now, what? Pamphilus's?

M. Why, is it not?

Chapter I did well always to avoid this marriage.

D. O villain, that deserves to be punished!

M. Why do you exclaim?

D. Which child? was not it brought to you yesternight in the evening?

M. O thou bold-faced fellow!

D. But I saw Canthara


M. Truly, I thank God
That some free-women were at her delivery.

D. Truly, she does not well know him, for whose cause she begins these things.
If Chremes (thinks she) shall see a child laid before the door,
He will not give his daughter: but he will the rather give her.

Chapter Truly he will not.

D. Moreover, now that you may know my mind,
Unless you take away the child, I will tumble him into the middle of the way,
And I will tumble you there in the dirt.

M. Truly thou art not a man in thy wits.

D. One piece of knavery Discovers another. I hear it whispered now amongst
them
That this Glycerie is a Citizen of Athens.

Chapter What now?

D. He shall
Be forced by the Law to marry her.

M. Why I pray you, is she not a Citizen?

Chapter I was almost fallen upon a merry mischief at unawares.

D. Who talks here? O Chremes, you come in very good time;
Do you hearken?

Chapter I have heard all.

D. Have you heard all these things?

Chapter I have heard all I say from the beginning.

D. Have you heard I pray you?
O the rogueries! It is fit this woman should be had hence to the house of
correction.
This is he: do not think that you make a fool of Davus.

M. Woe is me, poor woman! my old Master, I have spoken nothing untrue.

Chapter I know the whole matter. But is Simo within?

D. He is.

M. You villain, do not meddle with me; If I do not tell Glycerie all these
things --

D. Away, you silly woman, you perceive not what is done.

M. How should I perceive?

D. This is the Brides Father, it could not otherwise be brought about
That he should know th^se things we would have him.

M. You should have told me beforehand.

D. Do you think there is but small difference whether you do all by hab nab,
As the nature of them requires, or merely for the nonce?

Act IV. Scene 6.
Crito, Mysis, Davus. Chapter I Was told, that Chrysis lived in this street,
Who chose rather to get wealth here dishonestly,
Then to live poor and honestly in her own country,
Her goods are fallen to me by her death.
But I see some of whom I may ask. God save you.

M. I pray you,
Whom do I see? Is not this Crito, Chrysis her full cousin?
It is he.

Cr. O Mysis, God save you.

M. God save you, Crito.

Cr. Is it so, is Chrysis dead? Ha!

M. She has undone us poor women.

Cr. How do you? How do you live? Is all well with you?

M. What we?
We do as we can, as they say, when we cannot do as we would.

Cr. What does Glycerie? has she yet found out her parents here?

M. I would she had.

Cr. What not yet? I came hither unluckily;
For truly had I known that, I would never have set foot hither;
For she was always reported and held to be her sister,
She is in possession of what was Chrysis's. Now for me that am but a stranger
to follow suits here,
How easy and profitable it is likely to be, other men's examples forewarn me.
Besides I suppose she has now some friend or guardian,
For she was almost a grown woman when she went thence, They may cry out on me,
That I like a petty-fogging knave do hunt after another bodies estate, that I
am a beggarly rascal and besides
I may not bereave her of all.

M. O most honest stranger Crito, indeed you keep your old wont.

Cr. Bring me to her, and seeing I am come hither, let me see her.

M. Yes.

D. I will follow these folks; I am loath the old man should see me at this
time.

Actus IV. Scen. 6.
Crito, Mysis, Davus. Cr. IN hac habitasse platea dictum est Chrysidem,
Quae sese inhoneste optavit parare hic divitias,

M. Obsecro,
Quem video? Estne hic sobrinus Chrysidis?
Is est.

Cr. O Mysis, salve.

M. Salvus sis, Crito.

Cr. Itan' Chrysis? Hem.

M. Nos quidem pol miseras perdidit.

Cr. Qui vos? quo pacto? satin' recte?

M. Nosne?


Cr. Quid Glycerium? jam hic suos parents repperit?

M. Utinam.

Cr. An nondum etiam? haud auspicato huc me appuli:
Nam pol si id scissem, nunquam huc tetulissem pedem.
Semper enim dicta est esse haec, atque habita est soror.

Facile atque utile, aliorum exempla commonent.
Simul arbitror jam aliquem esse amicum and defensorem ei;
Nam fere grandiuscula jam profecta est illinc, clamitent me

I began to undergo danger enough. Now cease your entreating;
Whilst I strive to humor you, I have almost befooled away my daughters life.

S. Nay rather Chremes, I most earnestly request and desire you,
That you would really perform the kindness erewhile begun.

Chapter See how unreasonable you are through earnestness; so you may effect what
you have a mind to,
You neither consider any mean in courtesies, nor what you entreat me.
For if you did consider, you would forbear to burden me with your
unreasonableness.

S. What, what?

Chapter Alas, do you ask? You have forced me
To bestow my daughter on a young man entangled in love with another,
Not enduring to hear of a wife, for discord, and uncertainty of wedlock;
That by her trouble and grief I may cure your son;
You obtained your desire, I began to do it, whilst the matter suffered; and
now it does not suffer, you must bear with me.
They say she is a Citizen herehence, there a child born, let us alone.

Sim. I entreat you for Gods sake, that you would not give your mind to believe
them,
For whom it is most advantageous that he be as bad as bad can be;
All these things are done and undertaken because of the marriage;
When that cause why they do these things shall be taken away, they will be
quiet.

Chapter You are mistaken, I my self saw a maid chiding with Davus.

S. I know it.

Chapter But in good earnest, when neither of them knew beforehand that I was
there.

S. I believe it, and Davus told me a while before that the women would do it.
I know not what I have forgot to say to you to day, as I had intended.

Act. V. Scena 1.
Chremes, Simo. Chapter SAtis jam satis, Simo, spectata erga te amicitia est mea,
Satis periculi incepi adire; orandi jam finem face.
Dum studeo obsequi tibi, pene illusi vitam filiae.

S. Immo enim quam maxim abs te oro atque postulo, Chremes,
Ut beneficium initum dudum re comprobes.

Chapter Vide quam iniquus sis prae studio; dum id effici^s quod cupis,
Neque modum benignitatis, neque quid me ores, cogitas.
Nam si cogites, remittas jam me onerare injuriis.

S. Quibus?

Chapter Ah rogitas? perpulisti me ut homini adolescentulo

Filiam darem in seditionem; atque in incertas nuptias;
Ejus labor atque dolor gnato ut medicarer tuo.
Impetrasti, incepi dum res tetulit, nunc non fert, feras.
Illam hinc civem esse aiunt, puer est gnatus, nos missos face.

Sim.
Quibus id maxim utile est, illum esse quam deterrimum.
Nuptiarum gratia haec sunt facta atque incepta omnia.
Ubi ea causa, quamobrem haec faciunt, erit adempta his, desinent.

Chapter Erras: cum Davo egomet vidi jurgantem ancillam.

S. Scio.

Chapter

S. Credo, and id facturas Davus dudum praedixit mihi.
Et nescio quid tibi sum oblitus hodie ac volui dicere.

Act. V. Scene 2.
Davus, Chremes, Simo, Dromo. D. I Charge you presently to set your heart at
rest.

Chapter See where Davus is for you.

S. Whence comes he forth?

D. By my means and the strangers.

S. What mischief is that?

D. I never saw a fitter man,
A more seasonable coming, nor a better time.

S. Whom does the rogue commend here?

D. Now all is cock-sure.

S. Do I linger to speak to him?

D. Here is my Master, what shall I do?

S. God save you, good Sir.

D. What now? O our Chremes, all things are ready
Now within.

Chapter You have looked to them very well.

D. Send for the Bride when you will.

S. Very well indeed:
That is the reason forsooth he is now absent therehence. Withal, do you answer
me this; What business
Have you there?

D. Who, I?

S. Yes, you.

D. I?

S. I speak to you.

D. I went but in just now.

S. As though I asked you how long ago?

D. With your son.

S. What is Pamphilus within? I am tormented, poor man.
Why, you rogue, did not you tell me there was a falling out betwixt them?

D. So there is.

S. Why is he here then?

Chapter What do you think he is doing? he is chiding with her.

D. Nay, but indeed Chremes you shall hear me tell you a notable strange matter;
I know not what old man is come even now; but to look on, he is a substantial,
understanding man: if you saw his face,
You would deem him a very honest man; there is a settled gravity in his
countenance,
And truth in what he says.

S. What news do you bring us?

D. Nothing indeed
But what I have heard him say.

S. What says he then?

D. That he is sure
That Glycerie is a Citizen of Athens.

S. Ho, Dromo, Dromo!

Dr. What is the matter?

S.

D. Do but hear me.

S. If thou speak a word, Dromo.

D. I pray you, hear me.

Dr. What would you have?

S. Take up this fellow
A good height in a doors, as fast as you can.

Dr. Whom?

S. Davus.

Dr. Why so?

S. Because I list. Take him up, I say.

D. What have I done?

S. Take him up.

D. If you find I have told you any lie, kill me.

S. I do not hear you.
I will now vex your patience.

D. Although this be true.

S. Yea for all that, do you take care to keep him fettered. And do you hear,
Tie the beast neck and heels together. Go to now, I will show you if I live to
day,
What danger it is for you to deceive your Master, and him his Father.

Chapter Ah, be not in such a passion.

S. Chremes, do you not pity me, to see my sons dutifulness toward me,
That I should take so much pains for such a son? Well, Pamphilus; come out
here Pamphilus, are you no whit ashamed?

Act. V. Scen. 2.
Davus, Chremes, Simo, Dromo. D. ANimo nunc jam otioso esse impero.

Chapter Hem Davum tibi.

S. Unde egred^tur?

D. Meo praesidio atque hospitis.

S, Quid illud est mali?

D. Ego commodiorem hominem,
Adventum, tempus non vidi.

S. Scelus, quemnam hic laudat?

D.

S. Cesso alloqui?

D. Herus est, quid agam.

S. Salve, bone vir.

D. Ehem, O noster Chremes, omnia apparata sunt
Jam intus.

Chapter Curasti probe.

D. Ubi voles, accerse.

S. Been sane.
Id enimvero hinc nunc abest. Etiam tu hoc responde, quid istic tibi
Negotii est?

D. Mihin'?

S. Ita.

D. Mihine?

S. Tibi ego.

D.

S. Quasi ego quam dudum rogem?

D. Cum tuo

S. Anne est intus Pamphilus? crucior miser.
Eho, number tu dixtin' esse inter eos inimicitias, carnifex?

D. Sunt.

S. Cur igitur hic est?

Chapter Quid illum censes? cum illa litigat.

D. Imo vero indignum, Chremes, jam facinus faxo ex me audies.

Videtur esse quantivis pretii; tristis severitas inest in voltu,
Atque in verbis sides.

S. Quidnam adportas?

D. Nihil equidem,
Nisi quod illum audivi dicere.

S. Quid ait tandem?

D. Glycerium
Se scire civem esse Atticam.

S. Hem, Dromo, Dromo!

Dr. Quid est?

S.

D. Audi.

S. Verbum si addideris, Dromo.

D. Audi, obsecro.

Dr. Quid vis?

S. Sublimem into o hunc
Rape, quantum potes.

Dr. Quem?

S. Davum.

Dr. Quamobrem?

S. Quia lubet. Rape, inquam.

D. Quid feci?

S. Rape.

D. Si quicquam invenies mentitum, occidito.

S. Nihil audio.
Ege jam te commotum reddam.

D. Tametsi hoc verum est.

S. Tamen, tu cura adservandum vinctum. Atque audin quadrupedem
Constringito. Age nunc jam, ego pol hodie si vivo, tibi ostendam
Herum quid sit pericli fallere, and illi patrem.

Chapter Ah ne saevi tantopere.

S. Chremes, pietatem gnati! nonne te miseret mei? Tantum


Act V. Scen. 3.
Pamphilus, Simo, Chremes. P. Who would speak with me? I am undone, it is my
Father.

S. What say thou of all knaves the worst?

Chapter Ah Speak rather to the matter, and forbear to give ill language.

S. As though any thing can be spoken too ill against this fellow.
Do you say it forsooth, Is Glycerie a Citizen?

P. So they report.

S. So they report! O his huge confidence!
Does he consider what he says? Is he sorry for what he has done.
See whether his color does show any sign of bashfulness?
That he should be so weak minded, as contrary to the custom
Of Citizens, and the law, and the mind of his own Father,
He should yet desire to have her to his utter disgrace?

P. Woe is me, poor man!

S. Oh Pamphilus, are you now sensible of it at last?
You should have said that long ago, I say long ago, when you so set your
mind,
As you must by any means effect what you had a desire to:
On that very day, that word was truly said of you.
But what do I do? why do I disquiet my self? why do I chase my self?
Why do I trouble my old age with his madness?
Is it that I should undergo the punishment for his faults?
Nay, let him take her, and fare him well; let him live with her.

P. My Father!

S. Why my Father? as if you had need of this father.
You have got a house, a wife and children, whether your Father will or no.
There he those brought that may say she is a Citizen: you shall have the
victory.

P. Father, may I speak a few words?

S. What will you say to me?

Chapter Yet, Simo, hear him.

S. I hear him? What should I hear him,
Chremes?

Chapter Yet let him speak.

S. Well, let him speak, I give him leave.

P. I confess I love this woman, and if that be an offense, I confess it too;
Father, I submit my self to you, lay what charge you will upon me, command me.
Will you have me marry, and let this woman go? I will bear it as well as I
can:
Only this I beseech you, that you would not think this old man was brought by
me.
Give me leave to clear my self, and bring him hither before you.

S. You bring him?

P. Suffer me, Father.

Chapter He desires but what is reason; give him leave.

P. Let me over-treat you.

S. I give you leave.
I could be content to yield to any thing, Chremes, so I may not find my self
to be cosened by this son of mine.

Chapter A little punishment is satisfaction to a father for a great offense.

Actus V. Scen. 3.
Pamphilus, Simo, Chremes. P. QUis me vult? perii, pater est.

S. Quid ais, omnium?

Chapter Ah,
Rem potius ipsam dic; ac mitte male loqui.

S. Quasi quicquam in hunc gravius dici possit.
Ain' tandem, civis Glycerium est?

P. Ita praedicant.

D.
Number cogitat, quid dicat? number facti piget?
Vide number ejus color pudoris signum usquam indicat?
Adeon' impotenti esse animo, ut praeter civium
Morem atque legem, and sui voluntatem patris,


P. Me miserum!

S. Hem: modone id demum sensistj, Pamphile?
Olim istuc olim cum ita animum induxisti tuum,
Quod cuperes aliquo pacto efficiundum tibi;
Eodem die istuc verbum vere in te accidit.

Cur meam senectam hujus solicito amentia?
An ut pro hujus peccatis ego supplicium sufferam?
Immo habeat; valeat; vivat cum illa.

P. Mi pater?

S. Quid, mi pater? quasi tu hujus indige as patris.
Demus, uxor, liberi inventi, invito patre.
Adducti qui illam civem hinc dicant: viceris.

P. Pater, licetne pauca?

S. Quid dices mihi?

Chapter Tamen, Simo, audi.

S. Ego audiam? Quid ego audiam,
Chreme?

Chapter Attamen, dicat, fine.

S. Age, dicat, sino.

P.
Tibi, pater, me dedo; quidvis oneris impende, impera.
Visne uxorem ducere, hanc vis amittere? ut potero, feram:
Hoc modo te obsecro, ut ne credas a me allegatum hunc senem.
Sine me expurgem, atque illum huc coram adducam.

S. Adducas?

P.

Chapter Aequum postulat, da veniam.

P. Sine te exorem.

S. Sino.
Quidvis cupio, dum ne ab hoc me falli comperiam, Chreme.

Chapter Pro peccato magno paululum supplicii satis est patri.

Act V. Scen. 4.
Crito, Chremes, Simo, Pamphilus. Cr. FOrbear to entreat me; any one of these
reasons persuade me to do it.
Either you, or because it is true, or because I wish well to Glycerie.

Chapter Do I see Crito of Andria? truly it is he.

Cr. God save you Chremes.

Chapter what do you at Athens, that are here so seldom?

Cr. It is so fallen out. But is this Simo?

Chapter This is he.

S. Do you ask for me? Why, do you say Glycerie is a Citizen of this place?

Cr. Do you deny it?

S. Do you come hither so well provided?

Cr. Why so?

S. Do you ask?
Do you think to do these things and go unpunished? Do you trapan
Young men here, that are unexperienced in the world, and honestly brought up?
Do you feed their fancies by enticing them on, and giving them fair words?

Cr. Are you well in your wits? and do you take them, and their whores
together?

P. I am undone. I am afraid the stranger cannot abide it.

Chapter Simo, if you knew this man sufficiently,
You would not judge so. He is an honest man.

S. Can this be an honest man?
Comes he so very jump to day upon the very nick of the marriage,
That he could never come before now? Must we believe him, Chremes?

P. B^t that I am afraid of my Father; I have something I could tell him very
well how to answer that matter.

S. You petty-fogging knave.

Cr. What now!

Chapter He is as you see, Crito, forbear him.

Cr. Let him consider who he is.
If he proceed to say what be list to me, he shall hear what he list not.
Do I meddle with those things, or care for them? Will not you bear your own
grief patiently?
For as concerning what I said, it may be quickly known, whether what you
heard, be true, or false.
An Athenian a good while ago having suffered Shipwreck, was cast a shore at
Andros,
And that little girl with him; Then he being in want by chance,
First betook himself to Chrysis Father.

S. He begins to tell a tale of a tub.

Chapter Let him go on.

Cr. Does he so interrupt me indeed?

Chapter Go on.

Cr. Beside,
He that entertained him was my Cousin. There I heard it of the man himself,
That he was an Athenian. He died there.

Chapter What was his name?

Cr. Must I tell you his name so quickly? Phania.

Chapter Ah, I am undone.

Cr. But truly
I think it was Phania. This I am sure of, he said he was one of Rhamnus.

Chapter O Jupiter!

Cr. O Chremes, many others in Andros heard
These same words then.

Chapter I wish it were as I hope it is, Well tell me
What did he say she was? Did he say she was his daughter?

Cr. N^.

Chapter Whose then?

Cr. His brothers daughter:

Chapter Surely she is mine.

Cr. What say you?

S. What
Is that you say?

P. Listen, Pamphilus.

S. How, do you believe it?

Chapter That Phania was my brother.

S. I knew the man, and know it was so.

Chapter He flying hen^e to avoid the war, and thinking to follow me into Asia,
Made a journey after me, he was then afraid to leave her here.
After those things, this is the first time I ^ear what was become of him.

P. I am scarce my own man, my mind is so tossed with fear,
And joy, and hope, and wondering at this so great and so s^dden a good hap.

S. Truly I am glad that she is so many ways found to be your daughter,

P. I bele^ve it, Father.

Chapter But one scruple yet remains with me.
Which does very much trouble me.

P. You deserve to be shent with your (...),
You seek a knot in a bull-rush.

Cr. What is that?

Chapter Her name
Does not accord.

Cr. Sh^e had another name truly when she was a little girl.

Chapter What, Crito? Do you remember it.

Cr. I am calling it to mind.

P. Should I suffer this man's memory to hinder my pleasure,
Seeing I can easily help my self in this matter?
I will not suffer it. O Chremes, the name is Pasibula which you enquire after.

Cr. That is she.

Chapter That is just she.

P. I heard it of her a thousand times.

S. Chremes, I think you believe that we are all glad at this.

Chapter In g^ earnest; I beleve it.

P. Father, what remains more to be done?

S. The matter it self has reconciled me toward you a good while ago.

P. O fine father! Chremes alters nothing about my wife,
But that I may have her so as I have had.

Chapter Very good reason, except your father
Say otherwise.

P. As for the portion forsooth.

S. That indeed is to be looked after.

Chapter Her portion.
is five hundred pounds.

P. I accept it.

Chapter I haste to my daughter.
(...) Crito, go along with me, for I believe she scarce knows me.

S. Why do you not give order she should be brought over hither?

P. You do well to put us in mind, I will now Commit that business to Davus.

S. He cannot do it.

P. Why can he not?

S. Because he has another thing which more concerns him, and a greater matter
then that.

P. What is it?

S. He is fast in Prison.

P. Father, he is wrongfully imprisoned.

S. Not so, I commanded it.

P. I pray you bid him be set at liberty.

S. Well, be it so.

P. But make h^ste.

S. I am going in.

P. O what a joyful and happy day is this!

P. Some body perhaps
May-think I do not believe this to be true; but I have a good mind that it be
thus true.
I suppose the life of the Gods is therefore everlasting,
Because pleasures do properly belong to them, for I am immortal
Already, if no grief at all intermingle with this joy.
What, whom should I chiefly desire now to be offered me, to whom I may tell
these things?

Chapter What joy is that?

P. I see Davus: There is no man that I had rather have
Of all men living. For I know that he alone will be hearti'y glad of any thing
that rejoices me.

D. O Pamphilus!

P. You do not know what has befallen me.

D. True indeed: But I know what has befallen my self.

P. And so do I too.

D. The fashion of the world goes, that you should first know what harm I have
got,
5. Then I know what good has befallen you.

P. My Glycerie has found

D. That is well.

Chapter What now?

P. Her Father is
An especial friend of ours.

D. Who is that?

P. Chremes.

On those things which his mind ran upon when he was awake?

P. And as for the child, Davus.

D. Tush, say no more.
He is the only child whom the Gods love.

Chapter I am well, if these things be true;
I will go to him, and speak with him.

P. What man is this? O Charinus, you come
In the very nick of time.

Chapter It is well done.

P. What, have you heard the matter?

Chapter I have heard all; well, think of me in your prosperity. Now Chremes is
yours,
I know he will do all things that you would have him do.

P. I know it:
But it would be too long for us to tarry for him till he come forth; follow me
this way.
He is within with Glycerie. Do you Davus go quickly home,
Fetch some body to lead her away hence: why do you stand still? why do you
loyter?

D. I am going.
Do not ye tarry till they come out hither; she will be married within:
It will be dispatched within doors, if there be any thing remaining to be
done. Clap your hands.

The Argument, or Plot of Eunuchus, by C. Sulpitius Apollinaris.
THe Soldier Thraso, not knowing so much, brought
With him a Maid which was falsely reported to be Thais's Sister,
And bestowed her on her. This Maid was a Citizen of Athens.
Phaedria a sweetheart of Thais, gives command, that an Eunuch
Which he had bought, should be delivered to her; and goes himself into the
Country,
Being entreated to give place to Thraso for two days.
A young stripling Phaedrias's brother (forasmuch as he dearly loved
The little girl which was sent for a present to Thais)
Is clad in the Eunuchs habit. Parmeno persuades him to it.
He went in, he defloureth the Maid. But his brother
Being found to be a Citizen of Athens, bestows her
When she was destoured on the stripling. Thraso over-intreateth Phaedria.
Eunuchi Argumentum. C. Sulpitio Apollonari authore.
SOrorem falso dictitatam Thaidis,
Id ipsum ignorans miles advext Thraso,
Ipsique donat. Erat haec civis Attica.
Eidem Eunuchum, quem emerat, tradi jubet
Thaidis amator Phaedria, acirus ipse abit,
Thrasoni oratus biduum concederet.
Ephebus frater Phaedriae (puellulam
Cum deperiret dono missam Thaidi,)
Ornatu Eunuchi induitur, suadet Parmeno.
Introiit, vitiat virginem. Sed Atticus
Civis repertus frater ejus, conlocat
Vitiatam ephebo: Phaedriam exorat Thraso.
The Prologue.
IF there be any that sets himself to please
All good men and to be offensive to few:
This Poet professes himself to be one of them.
Again if there be any that thinks he is too sharply
Spoken against, let him thus think,
That an Apology, and not an Invection is made, because he did the first wrong,
Who by translating well, but ordering them badly.
Has made bad Latin Comedies of good Greek ones.
The same man has now lately set out Menanders Phasma,
And in his Thesaurus he has set down that the defendant pleaded,
Of whom it was demanded why the gold should be his,
Before the Plaintiff who demands it, declared how the treasure came to be
his,
And how it came into his fathers monument.
From henceforth let him not deceive himself, or think thus,
I have now given over, he has nothing to say to me.
I advise him not to mistake himself, and to leave off provoking me.
I have many other things, which shall now be forgiven,
Which shall be produced afterward, if he go on to offend me,
So as he has begun to do. As for this Menanders Eunuchus
Which we are now to act, he obtained, after the Aediles
Had bought it, that he might have liberty to see it;
It began to be acted when the Magistrate was there.
He cry^th out that a thief, not a Poet had set out a Comedy,
And yet bad added no words of his own to it;
That Colax was an old Comedy of Naevius and Plautus,
That the Parasites and Soldiers part were taken thence.
If that be an off nee, it is an offense committed through the Poets ignorance
Who did not purpose to play the thief:
That it is so you may now judge:
Colax is a Comedy of Menanders, in it is Colax the Parasite;
And the braggadocian Soldier he does not deny
That he has translated those parts into his Eunuchus,
Out of the Greek Comedy; but that he knew that those Comedies
Were translated before into Latin, he utterly denies it.
But if it be not lawful for diverse men to use the same parts,
How is it more lawful to introduce running servants
To feign grave matrons, naughty drabs,
A greedy parasite, a b^aggadocian soldier,
A child to be suborned, an old man to be cousened by his servant,
And that folks love, hate, or suspect? To conclude,
There is nothing now said, which has not been said heretofore.
Wherefore it is fitting that you should understand, and pass it by,
If new Comedians do, what the old have used to do.
Do you endeavor, and give silent attention,
That you may fully know what Eunuchus means.
Prologus.
SI quisquam est qui placere se studeat bonis
Quamplurimis, and minime multos laedere,
In his Poeta hic nomen profitetur suum.
Tum si quis est qui dictum in se inclementius
Existimavit esse, sic existimet,
Responsum, non dictum esse, quia laesit prius,
Qui been vertendo, and eas describendo male
Ex Graecis bonis, Latinas fecit non bonas.
Idem Menandri Phasma nunc nuper dedit,
Atque in Thesauris scripsit causam dicere,
Prius unde petitur aurum quare sit suum,
Quam illum qui petit, unde is Thesaurus sit sibi;
Aut unde in patrium monimentum pervenerit.
Dehinc ne fraudetur ipse se, aut sic cogitet,
Defunctus jam sum, nihil est quod dicat mihi,
Is ne erret moneo, and desinat lacessere.
Habeo alia multa nunc quae condonabuntur;
Quae proferentur post, si pergat laedere,
Ita ut facere instituit. Quam nunc sumus acturi
Menandri Eunuchum, postquam aediles emerunt,
Perfecit, sibi ut inspiciund^ esset cop^a.
Magistratus cum ibi adesset, occoepta est agi.
Exclamat furem, non Poetam, fabulam
Dedisse, and nihil dedisse verborum tamen;
Colacem esse Naevi, and Plauti veterem fabulam,
Parasiti personam inde ablatam and militis.
Si id peccatum est, peccatum imprudentia est
Poetae, qui non furtum facere studuerit.
Id ita esse vos jam judicare poteritis.
Colax Menandri est, in ea est parasitus colax,
Et miles gloriosus, eas se non negat
Personas transtulisse in Eunuchum suam
Ex Graeca: sed eas fabulas factas prius
Latinas scisse se, id vero pernegat.
Quod si personis iisdem uti aliis non licet,
Qui magis licet currentes servos scribere,
Bonas matronas facere, meretrices malas,
Parasitum edacem, gloriosum militem,
Puerum supponi, falli per servum senem,
Amare, odisse, suspicari? Denique
Nullum est jam dictum, quod non dictum sit prius,
Quare aequum est vos cognoscere, atque ignoscere,
Quae veteres factitarunt, si faciunt novi.
Date operam, and cum silentio animadvertite,
Ut pernoscatis quid sibi Eunuchus velit.
Act. I. Scene 1.
Phaedria, Parmeno. Ph. WHat then shall I do? Should I not go? no, not now
When I am sent for by her of her own accord? or should I rather so behave my
self,
As to let her see I cannot put up the abuses of Whores?
She has shut me out of: door, she calls me back again, should I go back
again? no, though she should entreat me.

P.
But if you once begin, and not perform it gallantly,
And when you cannot endure, when no body shall desire you,
Before you have made peace, you shall come to her, and tell her
That you love her, and cannot abide without her, all is dashed, you may go
fiddle,


Ph. Therefore do you consider well of it, while time serves.

Par. Master, you cannot rule that thing by advice,
Which is neither capable of any advice, nor observes any mean.
All these vices are in love; Injuries,

War, and peace again. If you desire to make these uncertain things
Certain by reason, you should do no more good,
Then if you should endeavor to be mad with reason.
And that which you now in your angry mood think with your self,

I would die rather: she shall know what a fellow I am.
Verily, one counterfeit tear, which she has with much ado wrung from her eyes
By rubbing them pitifully, will cool these words,
And you will accuse your self of your own accord, and suffer her


Ph. O abominable act!
I now perceive her to be an errant queen, and that I am a wretched man.
It irketh me that I had any thing to do with her, and I burn in love, and
wittingly and willingly,
Being sensible and seeing it, I am undone, neither do I know what to do.

Par. What should you do? but ransom your self being a Prisoner, for as little

And do not torment your self.

Ph. Do you persuade me so?

Par. If you be wise:
And besides those troubles which love it self has
Do not you add more, and bear those patiently which it has,
But look where she is, the very destruction of our estate,


Act. I. Scen. 1.
Phaedria, Parmeno. Ph. QUid igitur faciam? non eam? ne nunc quidem
Cum accersor ultro? an potius ita me comparem,
Non perpeti meretricum contumelias?
Exclusit, revocat, redeam? non si me obsecr^t.

Par.
Verum si incipies, neque perficies gnaviter,
Atque ubi pati non poteris, cum nemo expetet,
Infecta pace, ultro ad eam venies; indicans
Te amare, and far non posse, actum est, illicet,


Ph. Proin tu, dum est tempus, etiam atque etiam cogita.

Par. Here, quae res in se neque consilium neque modum
Habet ullum, eam consilio regere non potes.
In amore haec omnia insunt vitia; injuriae,

Bellum, pax rursum. Incera haec si postules
Ratione cerca facere, nihilo plus agas,
Quam si des operam ut cum ratione insanias.
Et quod nunc tute tecum iratus cogitas,

Mori me malim; sentiet qui vir siem.
Haec verba una mehercule falsa lachrymula,
Quam oculos terendo misere vix vi expresserit,
Restinguet, and te ultro accusabis, and dabis


Ph. O indignum facinus! nunc ego
Et illam scelestam esse, and me miserum sentio.
Et taedet and amore ardeo, and prudens sciens,
Vivus vidensque pereo, nec quid agam, scio.

Par. Quid agas? nisi ut te redimas captum quam queas

Et ne te afflictes.

Ph. Itane suades?

Par. Si sapis,
Neque praeterquam quas ipse amor molestias habet,
Addas, and illas quas habet recte feras.
Sed ecca, ipsa egreditur nostri fundi calamitas;


Act. I. Scene 2.
Thais, Phaedria, Parmeno. Th. AH me poor woman, I am afraid lest Phaedria
Should take that more heavily, or otherwise then I did it,
Because he was not admitted yesterday.

Ph. Parmeno,
I tremble every joint of me, I am in a fright since I saw her.

Par. Have a good heart,


Th. Who talks here? Alas, was it you here, my Phaedria?
Why stood you here? Why did you not come in straight?

Par. But
Here is not a word of shutting out.

Th. Why do you not speak?

Th. Forsooth, because indeed these doors stand always open for me,


Th. Let these complements pass.

Ph. What let them pass? O Thais, Thais, I wish I had
A like share of your love as you have of mine, and that it might come to pass
in like manner,
That this might either grieve you, just as it does me;
Or that I could value that doing of yours as nothing.

Th. Phaedria,
I did not do it truly therefore because I loved or affected any man more then
you,
But so the case stood, it must needs be done.

Par I believe, as it fell out, the poor woman shut him out of doors for love.

Th. Say you so Parmeno? Well go to: But hear for what cause


Ph. Be it so.

Th. First ^elt me
This, can this man hold his peace?

Par. What, I? very well:
But do you hear, I assure you faithfully on this condition;
What I hear that is true, I conceal, and keep in very well;
But if any thing be false, or forged, it is all abroad presently.

And therefore if you would have it concealed, speak what is true.

Th. My mother was born at Samos, she dwelt at Rhodes.

Par. This may be concealed.

Th. Moreover a Merchant there
Gave my mother a little gire for a present,
Athens.

Ph. A Citizen, or no?

Th. I think she was one,
I am not sure; she told us the name of her Mother and Father,
But her Country, and other marks she neither knew,
Nor indeed could she by reason of her age.
The Merchant told us this moreover, that he had heard

My mother as soon as she had her, began to teach her
All things carefully, and to bring her up so, as if she had been her daughter;
Most folks thought that she was my sister:
I went thence hither with that stranger, with whom alone I had to do,


Par. Both these are false, out it goeeth.

Th. How know you that?

Par. Do you ask?
Because you was neither content with one, neither did alone give them:
For this man has also brought you a good, and a great share.

Th. It is so; but let me come to my tales end, as I desire.

Went a journey into Caria; in the mean space
I became acquainted with you; you your self know after these things, how
tenderly
I loved you, and how I made you privy to all my counsels.

Ph. Parmeno will not conceal this.

Par. Oh, is there any doubt of that?

Th.
But a while ago, her brother was somewhat covetous;
He, when he saw this maid to be of a lovely beauty,
And skilled on an instrument, hoping to get a sum of money,
Brought her out presently, and sold her; By mere fortune this friend of mine
Was there present; he bought her for a present for me,
Unwitting and ignorant of all these matters:
I came hither, and after he perceived that I had dealing with you too,
He made all the excuses he could, that he might not give me her.
He said, if he might be sure that he should be preferred with you
Before me, and might not fear, lest when I had got her,
I should forsake him, he could find in heart to bestow her on me,
But he was afraid of that. But as far as I can gather,
He has a mind to the maid.

Ph. Was there any more betwixt them?

Th. Nothing; for I enquired: Now my Phaedria,
There are many reasons, why I should desire to get her from him:
First, Because she is reported to be my sister: and besides, that I may
Restore and deliver her to her friends. I am a lone woman, I have no body
here,
Neither friend, nor kindsman. Wherefore; my Phaedria,
I desirt to get me some friends by my good office;
I pray you help me about it, that it may be done more easily.
Give him leave to have the greater respect from me
For these few day^s. Do you make me no answer?

Ph. Thou naughty queen,
Should I answer you any thing with your such doings?

Par. O brave Master of ours, I commend you. She is very sorry at last, you
play the man.

Ph. But I did not know what your speech tended to: There was a little girl
Stolen away hence, my mother brought her up for her own:
She is reported to be my sister: I desire to get her from him, that I may
restore her to her friends.
Forsooth all these words come to this; in short,
I am shut out, he is entertained. For what cause?
But that you love him better than me; i and you now fear that wench
Which is brought hither, lest she should get him such a man as he is from you.

Th. Am I afraid of that?

Ph. What else then troubles you?
Tell me, does he alone give you gifts? did you ever find
My bounty to be restrained toward you?
Did not I, when you told me that you desired to have a little maid
From Aethiopia, leaving all my business,
Get you one? Besides you said, you desired to have an Eunuch,
Because none but great Ladies use such* I got you one*
I gave twenty pounds yesterday for them both.
For all this I am slighted by you. I have not forgot these things.
For these good turns I am scorned by you.

Th. What is this you say, Phaedria?
Although I desire to get her away from him, and I suppose by this means
It may best of all be done, yet nevertheless
Rather then I should have your dis-favour, I will do as you would have me.

Ph. I would to God you spoke that word from your heart and really,
Rather then I should have your dis-favour, if I thought
It was sincerely spoken, I could away with any thing.

Par. How soon does he begin to falter, being overcome with one word?

Th. Do not I poor woman speak from my heart? what thing
Did you desire of me in jest, but you obtained at last*
Can not I obtain this of you, that you would but go aside
Two days only?

Ph. If it be but two days;
But let them not be made twenty days.

Th. Truly not above two days, or --

Ph. O^ I matter not.

Th. It shall not be, only let me entreat you this.

Ph. Yes forsooth,
I must do, what will you have me do.

Th. I love you because you deserve it.

Ph. You do well.
I will go into the country, there will I pine my self this two days,
I am resolved to do it, I must satisfy Thais mind.
Do you, Parmeno, see they be brought hither.

Par. Yes.

Ph. farewell for these two days.

Th. My Phaedria,
Fare you well too; would you have any thing else?

Ph. Would I have any thing else?
I desire that you may be absent from the soldier, when you are present with
him,
That you would love me night and day, and long for me,
That you would dream on me, look for me, think on me,
Hope for me, delight your self with me, and be wholly with me.
Lastly, see that you be my sweetheart, for as much as
I am yours.

Th. Woe is me poor woman, this man perhaps
Gives little credit to me, and now judges me by other women's dispositions,
But I indeed, who am privy to my self, am sure of this,
That I have not forged any lie, neither is any man
More dear to my heart then this Phaedria is.
And whatever I have done in this matter, I did it
For the maids sake; for I hope I have now in a manner
Found out her brother, a very noble young gentleman;

I will go in hence, and tarry looking for him till he come.

Actus I. Scen. 2.
Thaas, Phaedria, Parmen^. Th. MIseram me! vereor ne illud gravius Phaedria
Tulerit, neve aliorsum, atquc ego feci, acceperit,
Quod heri intromissus non est.

Ph. Totus tremo
Parmeno, horr^^, postquam aspexi hanc.

Par. Bono animo es.


Th. Quis hic loquitur? Ehem, tun' hic eras, mi Phaedria!
Quid stabas hic? Cur non recte introibas?

Par. Caeterum De exclusione verbum nullum.

Th. Quid taces?

Ph. Sane quia vero hae mihi patent semper fores,


Th. Missa istaec face.

Ph. Quid missa? O Thais, Thais, utinam esset mihi
Pars aequa amoris tecum: ac pariter fieret
Ut aut hoc tibi doleret, itidem ut mihi dolet;
Aut ego istuc abs te factnm nihili penderem.

Th.
Non pol quo quenquam plus amem, aut plus diligam
Eo feci: sed ita erat res; faciundum fuit.

Par, Credo, ut fit, misera prae amore exclusit hunc for as.

Th. Siccine ais, Parmeno? age; Sed, huc qua gratia


Ph. Fiat.

Th. Dic mihi
Hoc primum, potin' est hic tacere?

Par. Egone? optume,
Verum heus tu, lege hac tibi meam astringo fidem:
Quae vera audiv, taceo, and contineo optime;
Sin falsum, aut vanum, aut fictum est, cont^nuo palam est.

Proin tu taceri si vis, vera dicito.

Th. Samia mihi matter fuit, ear habitabat Rhodi.

Par. Potest taceri hoc.

Th. Tum ibi matri parvulam
Puellam dono quidam mercator dedit,


Ph. Civemne?

Th. Arbitror.
Certum non scimus: matris nomen and patris
Dic^bat ipsa: patriam and signa caecera
N^que sciebat, neque per aetatem etiam potuerat.
Mercator hoc addebat, e praedonibus

Matter ubi accepit, cepit studiose omnia
Docere, educare, ita ut si esset filia.
Sororem plerique esse credebant meam.
Ego cum illo, quocum tum uno rem habebam, hospite,


Par. U^rumque hoc falsum est: efluit.

Th. Qui istuc?

Par. Rogas?
Quia neque uno eras content^, neque solus dedit:
Nam hic quoq bonam magnamque partem ad te attulit.

Th. Ita st: sed sine me pervenire quo volo.

In Cariam profectus est: te interea loci
Cognovi tute scis post illa quam intimum
Te habeam, and mea consilia ut tibi credam omnia.

Ph. Ne hoc quidem ^ebit Parmeno.

Par. Oh, dubiumne id est?

Th.
Nuper, ejus frater aliquantum ad rem est avidior;
Is ubi hanc forma videt honesta virginem,
Et fid^bus scire, pretium sperans, ill^co
Producit, vendit. Forte fortuna affuit
Hic meus amicus; emit eam dono mihi,
Imprudens harum rerum ignarusque omnium:
Is venit, postquam sensie me tecum quoque
Rem habere, fingit causas, ne det, sedulo.
Ait, si fidem habeat se iri praepositum tibi

Sese relinquam, velle sese mihi dare,
Verum id vereri; sed, ego quantum suspicor,
Ad virginem animum adjecit.

Ph. Etiamne amplius?

Th. Nihil: nam quoesivi; Nunc ego eam, mi Phaedria,

Primum quod soror dicta est; praeterea ut suis
Restituam ac reddam. Sola sum, habeo hic neminem
Neque amicum neque cognatum: Quemobrem, mi Phaedria.
Cupio aliquos praeparare amicos beneficio meo.

Sine illum priores parts hosce aliquot dies
Apud me habere; nihil respondes?

Ph. Pessuma,
Egon' quicquam cum istis factis respondeam?

Par. Heu noster, laudo. Tandem perdoluit: vir es.

Ph.
Hinc est abrepta; eduxit matter pro sua:
Soror dicta est; cupio abducere ut reddam suis.
Nempe omnia haec verba huc redeunt denique,
Excludor ego, ille recipitur: qua gratia?

Quae advecta est, ne illum talem praeripiat tibi?

Th. Egon' id timeo?

Ph. Quid ergo aliud sollicitat?
Cedo, number ille solus dona dat? nunc ubi meam
Benignitatem sensisti in te claudier?

Ancillulam, relictis rebus omnibus
Quaesivi? porro Eunuchum dixti velle te,
Quia solae utuntur his reginae; repperi.
Heri minas viginti pro ambobus dedi,

Ob haec facta abs te spernor.

Th. Quid istuc, Phaedria?
Quanquam illam cupio abducere, atque hac re arbitror
Id fieri posse maxim, veruntamen
Potius quam te inimicum habeam, faciam ut jusseris.

Ph.
POTIUS quam te inimicum habeam; si istuc crederem
Sincere dici, quidvis possem perpeti.

Par. Labascit, victus uno verbo, quam cito?

Th. Ego non ex animo misera dico? quam joco

Ego impetrare nequeo hoc abs te, biduum,
Saltem ut concedas solum.

Ph. Siquidem biduum
Verum ne fiant isti viginti dies.

Th. Profecto non plus biduum, aut.

Ph. Aut? nihil moror.

Th.

Ph. Scilicet,
Faciundum est quod vis.

Th. Merito te amo.

Ph. Been facis.
Rus ibo, ibi hoc me macerabo biduum,
Ita facere certum est, mos gerundus est Thaidi.
Tu, Parmeno, huc fac illi adducantur.

Par. Maxume.

Ph.

Th. Mi Phadria,
Et tu, nunquid vis aliud?

Ph. Egone quid velim?
Cum milite isto praesens, absens ut sies,
Dies noctesque ames me, me desideres,
Me somnies: me expectes, de me cogites:

Meus fac sis postren o animus, quandoquidem
Ego sum tuus.

Th. Me miseram, forsitan mihi hic
Parvam habeat fidem, atque ex aliarum ingeniis me nunc judicet.
Ego pol, quae mihi sum conscia, hoc certo scio,

Cordi esse quenquam chariorem hoc Phaedria,
Et quicquid hujus feci, causa virginis
Feci; nam me ejus fratrem spero propemodum
Jam repperisse, adolescentem adeo nobilem:

Concedam hinc intro: expectabo dum venit.

Act II. Scene 1.
Phaedria, Parmeno. Ph. Do as I bade you, let those be brought away.

Par. I will.

Ph. But diligently.

Par. It shall be done.

Ph. But quickly.

Par. It shall be done.

Ph. Have I not
Given you sufficient commands?

Par. Do you go on to ask, as though i^ were such a hard matter?
Phaedria, I wish you could as easily get any thing,


Ph. I am like to be lost my self too, which is a thing more precious to me;
Do not you take that so impatiently.

Par. No.
But would you have any thing else, and I will dispatch it for you?

Ph. Set out my present with words as well as you can, and thrust away
T^ copes-mate from her as far as you can.

Par. I remember it, though


Ph. I will go into the country, and tarry there.

Par. I think so.

Ph. But do you bear?

Par. What would you have?

Ph. Do you think that I can
Settle my self, and abide, so as not to come back again in the mean time?

Par. What you?
Truly I think not; for either you will return by and by, or your dreams after
a while,
Will drive you hitherway.

Ph. I will do some work, until I be weary,


P. You will lie waking, when you are weary,
And then you will do this the rather.

Ph. Alas, Parmeno, you talk to no purpose truly;
This niceness of mind must be cast away. I pamper my self too much.
Can I not be without her, if need be, for three days together?

Par. Whoo, whole three days? beware what you do.

Ph. I am resolved upon it.

Par.
By love, that you cannot know one to be the same he was? There was no man alive
Less given to folly, nor any one more stayed, or that could better bridle his
affections, than this man.
But who is this that comes on hither? Ah, Ah, this indeed is Gnatho
The Soldiers Parafite; he brings with him a Virgin for a present to her. O
strange!

With this decrepit Eunuch of mine* She surpasses Thai^ (...) self.

Act. II. Scene 1.
Phaedria, Parmeno. Ph. FAc ita ut jussi; deducantur isti.

P. Faciam.

Ph. At diligenter.

Par. Fiet

Ph. Mature.

Par. Fiet.

Ph. Satin' hoc
Mandatum est tibi?

Par. Ah, rogitare? quasi difficile sit,
Utinam tam aliquid invenire facile possis Phaedria


Ph. Ego quoque una pereo, quod mihi est charius.
Ne istoc tam iniquo patiare animo.

Par. Minime*
Sed nunquid aliud vis? quin effectum dabo.

Ph. Munus nostrum ornato verbis quoad poteris, and istum (...)
Quoad poteris ab ea pellito.

Par. Memini, tametsi


Ph. Ego rus ibo, atque ibi manebo.

Par. Censeo. Sed heus tu.

Par. Quid vis?

Ph. Censen' posse (...)
Obfirmare and perpeti, ne redeam interea?

Par. Tene? non hercle
Arbitror; nam aut jam reverte^, aut mox noctu te
Adigent horsum insomnia.

Ph. Opus faciam, ut defatiger use*


Par. Vigilabis lassus, hoc plus
Facies.

Ph. Ah, nihil dicis, Parmeno, ejiciunda hercle
Haec est mollities animi: Nimis me indulgeo.
Tandem ego non illa caream, si sit opus, vel totum* triduum?

Par. Hui universum triduum? vide quid agis.

Ph. Stat se^

Par.
Ex amore, ut non cognoscas eundem esse? hoc nemo fuit.
Minus ineptus, magis severus quisquam, nec magis continens.
Sed quis hic est, qui huc pergit? Atat, hic quidem parasitus Gnatho
Militis, ducit secum una virginem dono huic. Pape!

Cum meo decrepito hoc Eunucho: haec superat ipsam Thaidem.

Act II. Scen. 2.
Gnatho, Parmeno. G. O Wonderful! how much is one man more excellent to an
another?
What odds there is
Betwixt a wise man and a fool? This came into my mind thus upon the occas^^n;
As I was coming hither to day, I met with one of my own rank
And condition, a man that was no niggard, who had consumed as (...) had done

Sickly, full of tatters and years: What apparel is this? quoth I,
Because* I poor man, have idly spent what I had; Alas, to what estate
Am I brought? All my acquaintance and friends forsake me.
Hereupon I scorned him in comparison of my self. what you, Idle fellow, quoth
I,

Have you lost your wit with your estate? Do you not see me
Come from the same estate, what my color, neatness, clothing, and plight of
body is?
I have all things, and yet have nothing: and though I have nothing, yet
I want nothing. But I poor man, can neither endure to be made a fool on,

You are far deceived. This sort of men made again of it in times past,
In the days of old: This is a new kind of bird-catching.
Besides, I first was he that invented this way: There is a sort of men
That would have themselves reputed the bravest in the world. I follow these.
I do not apply my self to these, that they may laugh at me, but I laugh at
them for the nonc^:
And withal, I wonder at their wits: what soever they say, I commend it; and
again
If they unsay it, I commend that too; if any one deny this or that, I deny it;
if he say it, I say it.
Lastly, I have such a command over my self, as to flatter them in every thing;
This is the greatest gain in the world now.

P. A pretty fellow inindeed!
He makes these men stark mad that were but fools before.

G. Whilst he and I talked thus, in the mean time, as we came into the shambles,
There came running, and glad to meet me, all the Comfit-makers, Fishmongers,
Butchers,
Cooks, Pudding-wrights, Fishermen, Fowlers, whom I had been beneficial to,
When I had my estate, and since I lost it, and yet do many good turns too;
they salute me, they invite me (...) supper,
They bid me welcome. When that poor hunger-starved fellow saw me
To be in so great repute, and that I got my living so easily, then
The man began to entreat me, that be might have leave to learn it of me:
I bade him follow me, if be could learn; that as the Sects of Philosophers
Have their names from them, so Parasites in like manner might be called
Gnathonicks.

P. Do you not see what idleness and other men's meat can do?

G. But I make small baste
To bring this maid to Tha is, and to entreat her to come to supper.
But I see Parmeno, the rivals servant, sad before Thais' s door:
All is well enough yet I forsooth men may stand and starve here.
I am resolved to play upon this knave.

Par. These suppose Thais is theirs,
By this present.

G. Gnatho greeteth Parmeno his especial friend With many salutations, what are
you doing?

Par. I am standing.

G. I see that. But do you see any thing here which thou would not see?

Par. I see you.

G. So I think. But see you nothing else?

Par. Why so?

G. Because
You are sad.

Par. Never a whit indeed.

G. Be not so. But do you think of
This slave?

Par She is no ill-favored one indeed.

G. I nettle the fellow.

Par. How, you are quite deceived!

G. How weldome will this present be to Thais
Think thou?

Par. This is as much as if you should say, that we are packt out hence;
But do you hear, There is an alteration of all things.

G. Parmeno,
I will set you at ease for these whole six months;
That you may not run to and fro, nor sit up till light day:
Do not I make you a happy man?

Par. What me! whoo.

G. Thus I use to pleasure my friends.

Par. I commend you.

G. I detain you, perhaps you had gone somwhither else
If I had not detained you,

Par. No whither.

G. Then
Afford me a little of your help; cause that I may be admitted in to her.

Par. Well, go on, these doors stand open for you, because you bring that maid.

G. Would you have any body called out hither?

Par. Let but these two days
Be passed, and I will be sure to make you that are happy, to open me the doors
now with one little finger,
That you shall often kick against with your heels to no purpose.

G. Do you stand here yet, Parmeno? what are you left to be a Watchman,
Lest any Messenger should hap now to step privily from the Soldier to Thais?

Par. Wittily spoken; Mavelous things they must be, that should please the
soldier.
But do not I see my Masters younger son coming hither?
I wonder why he went from Piraeum, for he is now to keep public watch there.
There is something in the matter, and comes hastily; he looks about him I know
not at what.

Act II. Scen. 3.
Chaerea, Parmeno. Chapter I Am undone, the maid is nowhere to be found; and I am
lost too, that lost her
Out of my sight. Where should I seek her? where should I look after her? whom
should I ask for her?
What way should I tak? I am uncertain: yet this is my only hope,
Wherever she is, she cannot be long concealed. O beautiful face! I will

These common ordinary beauties.

Par. But look you where the other brother is,
He talks something of love.

Chapter O this unfortunate old man!

Par. This is he indeed,
Who if he begin to love, you will say his other brother was but a sport and a
jest,
In comparison of these things which his mad fit will afford.

Chapter I wish

And me too, because I stood still, and did not set him light. But look where
Parmeno is, God save you.

Par. Why are you so sad? why are you not merry? whence come you?

Chapter Truly I do not know either whence I come, nor whither I go, I have so
utterly


Par. How, I pray you?

Chapter I am in love.

Par. How now?

Chapter Now, Parmeno,
Show your self what an honest man you are; you know you often promised me,
saying, Chaerea,
Do but find out one that you can love, and I will let you know how far
I am able to pleasure you in that matter; when I give thee all my Fathers
provision
Into thy cock-loft privately.

Par. Go on, you fool.

Chapter Truly this was done:


Par. If so be the thing
Be worthy that one should bestow pains about it.

Chapter The maid is not like
Our ordinary Lasses, whom the mothers strive that they may have their shoulders
Down, and have their bodies laced, that they may be slender. If so be
One be a little grosser, they say she is a Champion, they abridge them of
their diet;


Par. What a one was thine?

Chapter Such a feature of a face is seldom seen.

P. Wh^o.

Chapter Her
Color is natural, her body is sound, and full of good blood.

P. Of what years is she?

Chapter Sixteen*

P. The very prime of her age.

Chapter See thou procure me her, either by force, or by privy stealth, or by love
for a while.
It makes no matter to me, so I may but have her.

P. What whose maid is she?

Chapter

Par. Whence is she?

Chapter I can tell you just as much.

Par. Where dwells she?

Chapter I cannot tell that neither. Where lost you her?

Chapter In the way.

Par. How
Came you to lose her?

Chapter Truly as I came I was now angry at my self for that,
Neither do I think there is any man to whom all good fortunes.
Fall out more* cross.

Par. What villainy is this?

Chapter I am undone.

Par. What is done?

Chapter Archimedes a kinsman of my faand of his age?
Why should I not?

Chapter He, as I was following the maid, met me. Truly it was inconveniently.

Chapter Nay indeed unluckily, for other things may be accounted inconveniences.
I may safely swear I had not seen him at all these six or seven months
Last post, but just now, when I had least mind to see him, and when I h^^ no
need.


P. Yes.

Chapter He presently came running to me, a great way off, being crooked,
^rembling, with his lips hanging down, groaning; Ho, h^, I speak to you?
Chaerea, says he, I stood still. Wot you what I would have with you? Tell me;
To morrow
I must have a trial. What then? I would have you be sure to tell your father,
that be may
Remember to be of my counsel betimes in the morning. He was an hour telling
this,

When I looked this way toward the maid, she fairly had turned in the mean
while
Into this street of ours.

P. It is a wonder if he do not speak of this maid which
Was given erewhile for a present to Thais.

Chapter When I came hither, here was no maid;

P. Did any company follow the maid?

Chapter Yes, a Parasite


P. It is even she. Say no more; the matter is now at a point.

Chapter You mind other things.

P. Truly I mind this.

Chapter Do you know who she is? tell me,
Or have you seen her?

P. I have seen her, and know her.

Chapter And wot you where she is?

P. She is brought hither to Thais the whore, and is given her for a present.

Chapter Who


P. Thraso the soldier,
Phaedria's corrival.

Chapter You tell me my brother has a hard game to play.

P. Yes,
Indeed if you knew but what a gift he has provided on the other side to match
with this,
Then you would say so the rather.

Chapter What I pray you, in good sooth?

P. An Eunuch.

Chapter That
Ill-favored fellow I pray you, whom he bought yesterday, that old man,


P. That very same.

Chapter Certainly the man will be
Thrust out of doors with his gift. But I did not know that that Thais was our
neighbor.

P. She has not been long so.

Chapter I am undone. That I should never have seen her yet.
Come tell me, is she as handsome as she is reported to be?

P. Yes.

Chapter But
She is not to be compared to this of mine.

P. That is another matter.

Chapter I pray thee in earnest
Parmeno, see to it, that may obtain her.

Par. I will do the best I can, and will do my endeavor,
I will help you; would you have me do more?

Chapter Why do you go home now?

Par. That I may bring these slaves to Thais, so as your brother bade me.

Chapter O that happy Eunuch, that is to be bestowed into this house!

Par. Why so?

Chapter Do you ask? He shall alwayet behold his fellowservant at home

In one house; he shall sometimes take his victuals with her; he shall sometimes
Sleep by her side.

Par. What if you your self now should be made the happy man?

Chapter How,
Parmeno? answer me.

Par. You moy take his clothes.

Chapter His clothes?
What then must I do afterward?

Par. I will bring you in his stead.

Chapter I hear you.

Par.

Chapter I understand you.

Par. You may enjoy those commodities
Which you said erewhile he was like to enjoy. You may diet with her, you may
by her touch her,
Dally with her, and sleep by her side: forasmuch as none of them
Knows you, nor can they tell who you are. Besides your countenance and age
is such,
As you may easily prove your self to be the Eunuch.

Chapter You have said well, I never knew

As fast as you can.

Par. What do you mean? truly I did but jest.

Chapter You prate.

Par. I am undone: what have I done poor wretch? whether do you thrust me? you
will throw me over by and by.
Truly I read you, tarry.

Chapter Let us go.

Par. Do you go on.

Chapter I am resolved.

Par. Have a care this be not too rash a resolution now.

Chapter Truly it is not: Let me do it.

Par.

Chapter Is it
A villainous act, i^ I be brought into a bawdy house, and now come even with
Those whores, which contemn our young years, and continually torment us every
way,
And beguile them so as they have beguiled us;
Or rather, is it fit I should put up these things? It is but just that I should

Every body will think it was well done.

Par. What is that; if you be resolved to do it, do it.
But do not lay the blame on me afterward.

Chapter I will not*

Par. Do you bid me do it?

Chapter I bid you; noy, I charge and command you.

Par. I will never resist
Your authority. Follow me.

Chapter God speed us well.

Act III. Scen. 1.
Thraso, Gnatho, Parmeno. Th. ANd did Thais give me great thanks?

G. Huge ones.

Th. Say you so!
Is she glad?

G. Not so much indeed for the gift it self, as for that you bestowed it:
Indeed she heartily rejoices at that.

P. I come hither to see, that when time serves
I may bring my present; But see where the Soldier is.

Th. Truly I have that gift,


G. Indeed I have observed so much.

Th. Even the King gave me always great thanks for what I did; but he did not
so to others.

G. He often times by words trasfers the great honor upon himself, which was
got
By other men's pains; who has the wit that you have?

Th. You have it right.

G. Therefore the King had you in repute.

Th. Yes indeed.

G. To delight himself with you.

Th. Yes;
And to commit all his army and his counsels to me.

G. This is a wonder.

Th. And besides,
If at any time he grew weary of men's company, or was tired with business,
When he would take his ease, as though: do you not know my meaning?

G. I know it.
As though when he would ease his mind of that trouble.

Th. You hit it.
Then had he to be his guest.

G. ^hoo, you tell me of a fine king indeed.

Th.

P. Nay,
I think there are none like him, if he keep you company.

Th. They all envied me,
And spoke ill of me behind my back: I cared not a button; they spited me
pitifully;
But one of them very greatly, whom he had made master of his Indian Elephants,
When he began to be more trouble some then others; I pray you, you Yeoman of
the stirrup, (quoth I) are you so ^ickish,


G. Truly, it was well and wisely
Spoken: Whoo! You stifled the fellow. What said he?

Th. He was presently
Mute.

G. What should he but be so?

P. O strange* That vile rascal,
And wretch, and that errand thief.

Th. What Gnatho, did I never tell you that,
How I handled the young man of Rhodes at a feast.

G. Never. But


Th. This same
Young man of Rhodes, which I speak of, was with me at a feast: By chan^,
I had a whore, he began to jeer at that, and to scoff me. What say you,
You shameless fellow said I? You are a Hare your self, and look for a dain^y
bit.

G. Ha, ha, he.

Th. What is the matter?

G. Wittily, dai^tily, finely said, nothing surpasses it.


Th. Had you heard it?

G. Many times; and it is reported for a choice one.

Th. It is mine own.

G. I am sorry that it was
Spoken to an undiscreet young man, and one that is a Gentleman.

Par. But a mischief light on thee.

G. What said he, I pray you?

Th. He was quasht: All that were by, were ready to die with laughing. To be
short, they were all afraid of me.

G. Not without cause.

Th. But do you hear, had I not best clear my self to Thais concerning the maid,


G. By no means: Nay rather
Increase her suspicion.

Th. Why?

G. Do you ask? Do you not know, if she at any time
Make mention of Phaedria, or if she commend him, that she may nettle you
soundly?

Th. I think so.

G. To prevent that, there is no remedy but this; when she
Shall name Phaedria, do you presently name Pamphilus: If she shall at any time
Phaedria to feast it with us; do you say, let us encourage
Pamphila to sing; if she shall commend his beauty,
Do you on the contrary commend hers. To be short, give her quid for quo,
Which may vex her at the heart.

Th. If she loved me, Gnatho, then that might do some good.

G. Forasmuch as she desires and loves what you give, she ere this

Lest you in your angry fit should bestow elsewhere the commodity which she
Now gets by you.

Th. You say well; but that never entered into my thoughts.

G. It is fondly done; for you did not consider of it: But, Thraso, how much
better
Might you have found out this same thing your self?

G. Nunquam. Sed


Th. Una in
Convivio erat hic, quem dico, Rhodius adolescentulus. Forte
Habui scortum, cepit ad id ludere, and me irridere. Quid ais,
Homo, inquam impudens? Lepus tute es, and pulpamentum quaeris.

G. Ha, ha, he.

Th. Quid est?

G. Facete, laute, lepide, nihil supra.


Th. Audieras?

G. Saepe and fertur in primis.

Th. Meum est.

G. Doler dictum imprudenti
Adolescenti and libero.

Par. At te dii perdant.

G. Quid ille quaeso?

Th. Perditus. Risu omnes, qui aderant, emori. Denique, omnes metuebant.

G. Non injuria.

Th. Sed heus tu, pergon' ego me de istac Thaidi,


G. Nihil minus. Imo, auge
Magis suspicionem.

Th. Cur?

G. Rogas? sin'? siquando illa
Mentionem Phaedriae facit, aut si laudat, te ut male urat.

Th. Sentio.

G. Id ne fiat, haec res sola est remedio, ubi
Nominabit Phaedriam, tu Pamphilam continuo. Siquando

Cantatum provocemus. Si laudabit haec illius formam,
Tu hujus contra. Denique par pro pari referto, quod eam
Mordeat.

Th. Siquidem me amaret, tum istuc prodesset Gnatho.

G. Quando illud, quod tu das, expectat atque amat, jamdudum

Quem ipsa nunc capit fructum, ne quando iratus tu alio
Conferas.

Th. Been dixisti: at mihi istuc non in mentem venerat.

G. Ridiculum! non enim cogitaras* caeterum idem tute melius
Q^anto invenisses, Thraso!

Act III. Scen. 2.
Thais, Thraso, Parmeno, Gnatho, Pythias. Th. ME thought, I heard the Soldiers
voice
Even now: and look where he is! God save you, my Thraso.

Thr. O my Thais,
Mine own sweetheart, how is it with you? Do you love me ere a whit
For that singing wench?

Par. How handsomely does he complement! what a beginning has he made at his
coming!

Th.

G. Let us go then to supper, Why stay you?

Par. Behold the other! he would say he was spit out of that man's mouth.

Th. When you will;
I will make no stay.

Par. I will go to them, and make as though I came but now forth.
Thais, Are you going any whither?

Th. O Parmeno, It is well done
Truly of you: I am going to day.

Par. Whither?

Th. What? Do you not see this man?

Par. Phaedria.

Thr. Why stand we still? Why go we not hence?

Par. I pray you forsooth, that we may
By your good leave, give this Gentlewoman what we desire; and that we may
Have liberty to come and speak to her.

Thr. I think, they are very goodly gifts, not like mine.

Par. The deed will make mention. Do you hear; bid those come forth adores
quickly, whom I commanded to be brought out.
Aethiopia.

Thr. Here are three pounds.

G. Scarce.

Par. Where are you Dorus? come hither: Look you where an Eunuch is,
Of what a lovely countenance, of what a perfect age!

Thr. I swear
He is a comely person.

Par. What say you, Gnatho? Do you find any thing, that you can dislike in him?
And what say you Thraso? they hold their tongues: they commend him
sufficiently. Make trial of him

To be skillful in those things, which it is fitting for a young Gentleman to
know. And he that sent these things, does not desire you
To live with him alone, and that others shon^ shut out for his sake; nor does
he tell of
His fights, nor brag of his marks of honor: nor does he hinder you, which
Some body does; but he thinks it sufficient, if he be then entertained,


Thr. It seems
This fellow is a servant to some poor and beggarly Master.

G. For indeed I am sure,
No body could abide to have this fellow, that has wherewithal to get another.

Par. Hold you your tongue,
Whom I think to be the basest rascal in the world: for thou that can find in
thy heart
To flatter this fellow, wilt not stick, I suppose, to do any thing


Thr. Shall we now go?

Th. I will first bring these in,
And withal give order what things I would have done; afterward I will come
forth presently.

Thr. I will be gone hence. Do you tarry for her.

Par. It is not fit for a Commander
To go with his sweetheart along the way.

Thr. What should I use many words to thee?
You are like your Master.

G. Ha, ha, he.

Thr. What do you laugh at?

G. That which you said
Rhodian comes into my mind. But Thais comes forth.

Thr. Go thy way, step before, that things may be got ready at home.

G. It shall be done.

Th. Pythias, see you look diligently to it; that if Chremes chance to come
hither,
You entreat him first to tarry; if that cannot conveniently be done, to come
again;
If he cannot do that, bring him to me.

Py. I will do so.

Th.
See that you keep home.

Thr. Let us go.

Th. Do you come after me (maids.)

Act. III. Scen. 2.
Thais, Thraso, Parmeno, Gnatho, Pythias. Th. AUdire vocem modo militis
Visa sum: atque eccum. Salve mi Thraso.

Thr. O Thais mea,
Meum suavium, quid agitur? Ecquid nos amas de fidicina
Istac?

Par. Quam venuste! quod dedit principium adveniens!

Th.

G. Eamus ergo ad caenam. Quid stas?

Par. Hem alterum: ex homine hunc natum dicas.

Th. Ubi vis,
Non moror.

Par. Adibo atque adsimulabo, quasi nunc exeam.
Ituran' Thais quopiam es?

Th. Hem Parmeno, Been pol
Fecisti: hodie itura.

Par. Quo?

Th. Quid? hunc non vides?

Par.

Thr. Quid stamus? Cur non imus hinc?

Par. Quaeso hercle ut liceat,
Pace quod fiat tua, dare huic quae volumus: Convenire
Et colloqui.

Thr. Perpulcra credo dona, haud nostris similia.

Par. Res indicabit. Heus, jubete isto, for as quos jussi ocyus.


Thr. Hic sunc tres
Minae.

G. Vix.

Par. Ubi tu es, Door: accede huc. Hem Eunuchum,
Quam liberali facie, quam aetate integra!

Thr. Ita me dii ament,
Honestus.

Par. Quid tu ais, Gnatho? nunquid habes quod contemnas?
Quid tu autem Thraso? Tacent: Satis laudabant: fac periculum

Aequum est adolescentem, solertem dabo. Atque haec qui misit non sibi soli
postulat
Te vivere, and sua causa excludi caeteros, neque pugnas
Narrat, neque cicatrices suas ostentat: neque tibi obstat, quod
Quidam facit: verum ubi molestum non erit, ubi tu voles, ubi


Thr. Apparet servum hunc
Esse domini pauperis, miserique.

G. Non hercle nemo posset, sat
Scio, qui habet, qui pararet alium, hunc perpeti.

Par. Tace tu
Quem ego esse infra infimos omnes puto homines; nam qui
Huic animum assentari duxeris, e flamma te cibum


Thr. Jamne imus?

Th. Hos prius introducam,
Et quae volo simul imperabo: postea, continuo exeo.

Thr. Ego hinc abeo. Tu istam opperire.

Par. Non convenit una ire
Cum amica imperatorem in via.

Thr. Quid tibi ego dicam multa?
Domini similis es.

G. Ha, ha, he.

Thr. Quid rides?

G. Istuc quod dixti


Thr. Abi, praecurre, ut sint domi parata.

G. Fiet.

Th. Diligenter,
Pythias, fac ut cures, si Chremes huc forte advenerit,
Ut ores, primum ut maneat: si id non commodum est, ut redeat:
Si id non poterit, ad me adducito.

Py. Ita faciam.

Th.
Virginem; domi adsitis, facite.

Thr. Eamus.

Th. Vos me sequemini.

Act. III. Scene 3.
Chremes, Pythias. Chapter TRuly the more and more I consider it, without doubt
this Thais will do me
Some great mischief, I see I am so cunningly destroyed by her.
Even then when she first bade I should be sent for to her house, (one may ask,
What had you to do with her? Truly I do not know) when I came, she found

With me about some serious business. I had then a suspicion that all these
things
Were done in knavery: She sat down by me, she offered her self to to me;
She sought occasion of discourse: When she had little to say, she came to
this, as to enquire of me how long ago
It was since my father and mother died; I told her it was a long while ago.
Sunium, and how far it lay from the sea? I think,
This likes her well; she hopes she can get it from me. Lastly, she asked me,
whether I had
Ever a little sister lost from thence? whether any body was lost with her? and
what she had
When she was lost? and whether any body could know her? why should she ask
these things,
Unless perhaps she feigneth that she is that little sister of mine which was
lost long ago?

And no more. Thais is a gooddeal ^lder then I am;
Besides she sent to entreat me, that I would come to her. Let her tell me in
good earnest
What she would with me, or let her not trouble me. I will not come the third
time, Ho, ho.

Py. Who is there?

Chapter Its I Chremes.

Py. O most pretty,


Chapter I say, I am like to be trepand.

Py. Thais
Did most earnestly entreat you, that you would come again to morrow.

Chapter I am going into the country.

Py. I beseech you do it.

Chapter I say, I cannot.

Py. But do you tarry then
Here at our house, till she come again.

Chapter By no means.

Py. Why, my Chremes?

Chapter Get thee hence with a mischief.

Py. If you be so


Chapter I go then.

Py. Go your way Dorias, bring this man quickly to the soldiers.

Actus III. Scen. 3.
Chremes, Pythias. Chapter PRofecto quanto magis, magisque cogito, nimirum dabit
Thais
Mihi magnum malum: Ita me ab ea astute video labefactarier.
Jam tum cum primu n jussit me ad sese accersier domum: (roget
Quis, Quid tibi cum ea? ne noram quidem) ubiveni, causam,

Velle agere mecum. Jam tum erat suspicio dolo malo haec
Fieri omnia. Ipsa accumbere mecum, mihi sese dare,
Sermonem quaerere. Ubi friget, huc evasit; Quam pridem
Pater mihi and matter mortui essent: dico, jam diu. Rus Sunii

Hoc: sperat se a me avellere. Post^emo, ecqua inde parva
Perisset soror? ecquis cum ea una; and quid habuisset,
Cu n periit? ecquis eam posset noscere? haec cur quaereret
Nisi si illa forte, quae olim periit parvula soror, hanc se

Nata est sedecim, non major. Thais, ego quam sum, majuscula est.
Misit porro orare, ut venirem. Serio aut dicat quid vult,
Aut molesta ne siet. Non hercle veniam tert o. Heus, heus,

Py. Ecquis hic est?

Chapter Ego sum Chremes.

Py. O capitulum


Chapter Dico ego mihi insidias fieri.

Py. Thais
Maxumo te orabat operc, ut cras redires.

Chapter Rus eo.

Py. Fac amabo.

Chapter Non possum inquam.

Py. At tu apud
Nos hic mane, dum redeat ipsa.

Chapter Nihil minus.

Py. Cur mi Chremes?

Chapter Malam rem! hinc abi.

Py. Si istuc


Chapter Eo.

Py. Abi, o Dorias, cito hunc deduc ad militem.

Act. IV. Scene 1.
Dorias. D. I Swear, as far forth as I see by the soldier, I poor woman
Do somewhat fear, lest that mad fellow should make any bustle to day,
Or offer violence to Thais. For after Chremes the young man
The maids brother came, she entreated the soldier to give order

Moreover Thais was urgent upon him to invite the man; that she did
To stay Chremes there, because she had had no time for that matter
Which she desired to tell him concerning his sister. He inviteth him with a
heavy heart,
He tarried there, she begins to talk with him. Now the Soldier thought

He endeavored to do what he could to cross her. Ho boy, says he, call me
Pamphila,
That she may make us m^rry here. She cries out, By no means
Admit her to the banquet: The soldier fell from that to chiding.
In the mean time the woman strips her self of her gold, and gives it me to
carry away.


Act. IV. Scen. 1.
Dorias. D. ITa me Dii been ament, quantum ego illum vidi, non
Nihil timeo misera, ne quam ille hcdie insanus turbam
Faciat aut vim Thaidi. Nam postquam advenit Chremes
Adolescens frater virginis, militem rogat ut eum admitti

Thais porro instare ut hominem invitet; id faciebat
Retinendi illius causa, quia, illa quae cupiebat de sorore
Ejus indicare, ad eam rem tempus non erat. Invitat tristis;
Mansit ibi; illa cum illo sermonem incipit; miles vero sibi

Huic contra aegre! Heus, inquit, puer, Pamphilam accerse,
Ut delectet hic nos: illa exclamnt; minime gentium
In convivium illam: miles tendere inde ad jurgium;
Interea au^um sibi clam mul^er demit; dat mihi ut auferam:


Act IV. Scene 2.
Phaedria. P. AS I was going into the country, I began (as it falls out when
Any trouble is in ones mind) to consider one thing after another,
And to construe them all to the worst sense: What needs many words?
Whilst I mused upon these things, I went unawares beyond my house. I was gone

When I came to the turn, I stood still, and began to think with my self;
What now, must I tarry here alone two days without her?
What then will be next? It is nothing. What? nothing? If I may not have leave
To touch her, why, shall I not have leave so much as to see her? If I may not
do that,

I willingly pass by my country house. But what is the matter,
That Pythias goes out of doors so fearful on a sudden?

Actus IV. Scen. 2.
Phaedria. P. DUm rus eo, coepi egomet mecum inter vias, (ita ut fit ubi
Quid in animo est molestiae) aliam rem ex alia cogitare,
Et ea omnia in pejorem partem. Quid opus est verbis?
Dum haec reputo, praeterii imprudens villam. Long jam

Ubi ad ipsum veni d^ verticulum, constiti; occepi mecum
Cogitare, hem, biduum hic manendum est soli sine illa?
Quid tum postea? nihil est; quid? nihil? si non tangendi
Copia est, eho, ne videndi quidem erit? si illud non licet,

Nihil est. Villam praetereo sciens. Sed quid hoc est,
Quod timida subito egreditur Pythias?

Act IV. Scen. 3.
Pythias, Phaedria, Dorias. Py. WHere shall I poor woman find that wicked and
ungracious fellow?
Or where shall I seek for him? That he should dare to commit
This so bold a prank!

Ph. I am afraid what this should be.

Py. Moreover
And besides the rogue, after he had befooled the maid, he pitifully tare


Ph. What now?

Py. Who if he were but now offered
Me, how willingly could I claw out the eyes of that wizard!

Ph. I know not indeed what a stir has been made at home, whilst I was away, I
will go to her.
What is the matter? why do you make such haste, or whom do you look for,
Pythias?

Py. Ah Phaedria! whom do I look for? get you hence whither you deserve to go
with
Such unpleasant gifts of yours.

Ph. What is the matter?

Py. Do you ask
Me? what a stir that Eunuch which you gave us has made? He has defloured
The maid which the Soldier gave my Mistress for a present.

Ph. What say you?

Py. I am undone.

Ph. You are drunk.

Py. I wish they were so, that
Wish me ill.

D. Alas! I pray you, my Pythias, What strange thing
Was that?

Ph. You are mad, how could an Eunuch do that?

Py. I know him not, who he was, but the thing it self evidenceth
This that he has done: The maid her self weepeth, neither dare she
Tell you, when you ask her, what the matter is: and that honest man is not to
be seen.
Besides, I poor woman suspect this, that he stole away something out of the
house
When he went away.

Ph. I cannot sufficiently marvail, whether that idle fellow
Could go far off, unless perhaps he be gone home again to ^ur house.

Py. I pray you, go see, whether he be, or not.

Ph. I will let you know presently.

D. I am undone!
I pray you, my dear-heart, I never so much as heard of such an a^ominable
trick.

Py. But indeed I had heard that they are the greatest lovers of women in the
world,
But that they can do nothing: but it never came into my mind, poor woman:
For I should have shut him up somewhere, and not have committed the maid to
him.

Actus IV. Scen. 3.
Pythias, Phaedria, Dorias. Py. UBi ego illum scelerosum misera atque impium
inveniam?
Aut ubi quaeram? Hoccine tam audax facinus facere
Esse ausum?

Ph. Hoc quid sit, vereor.

Py. Quin
Etiam insuper scelus, post quam ludificatus est virginem, vestem


Ph. Hem?

Py. Qui si nunc si detur
Mihi, ut ego unguibus facile illi in oculos involem venefico!

Ph. Nescio quid profecto absente nobis turbatum est domi: adibo
Quid istuc? quid festinas? aut quem quaeris, Pythias?

Py. Hem Phaedria, egon' quem quaeram, abi hinc quo dignus cum


Ph. Quid istuc est rei?

Py. Rogas
Me? Eunuchum quem dedisti nobis, quas turbas dedit? Virginem
Quam herae dono dederat miles, vitiavit.

Ph. Quid ais?

Py. Perii.

Ph. Temulenta es.

Py. Utinam sic sient, qui mihi
Male volunt.

D. Au, obsecro mea Pythias, quid istucnam


Ph. Insanis, qui i^tuc facere Eunuchus
Potuit?

Py. Ego illum nescio qui fuerit; hoc quod fecit
Res ipsa indicat. Virgo ipsa lachrumat, neque cum rogites,
Quid sit, audet dicere. Illa autem bonus vir nusquam apparet.
Etiam hoc misera suspicor, aliquid domo abeuntem


Ph. Nequeo mi^ari satis, quo ille abire
Ignavus posset long us: nisi domum forte ad nos rediit.

Py. Vise, amabo, number sit.

Ph. Jam faxo scies.

D. Perii,
Obsecro, tam infandum facinus, mea tu, ne audivi quidem.

Py. At pol ego amatores audieram mulierum esse eas maxumos,

Nam illum aliquo conclusissem, neque illi commisissem virginem.

Act IV. Scene 4.
Phaedria, Dorus, Pythias, Dorias. Ph. COme out of doors, you rogue; but do you
sneak back indeed? you runnagate-rogue, come out.
Yau that are ill bought.

Dor. I beseech you.

Ph. Oh, see what a wry mouth
The hangman makes! Why came you back hither again?
Why are your clothes changed? what say you? If I had ta^ried never so little
^onger,
I should not have found him at home, he had made himself so ready to run away.

Py. Have you the sellow, I pray you?

Ph. What else should I but have him?

Py. O well done!

Dori. This is very well done indeed.

Py. Where is he?

Ph. Do you ask? do you not see him?

Py. Whom I pray you, should I see?

Ph. This fellow
Forsooth.

Py. What fellow is this?

Ph. He that was brought
To you to day.

Py. None of us ever saw this fellow
With our eyes, Phaedria.

Ph. Did none of you see him?

Py. I pray, did you believe
That this was the fellow that was brought to us?

Ph. For whom else should I believe
To be he? I had no body else.

Py. Fi^, this fellow is not ta be compared
To him; he had an handsome face, and well-favoured.

Ph. So he seemed to you er^-while, because he was ^lad in a changeable suit;
Now you think him to be ugly, because he has not that on.

Py. I pray you hold your peace; as if indeed there was but a very little
difference betwixt them.
There was brought to our house to day a young youth, whom you, Phaedria,
Would indeed be glad to see: but this is a wizz^nd, old, d^ousie, aged fellow,
As tawnie as a we sil.

Ph. How now, what a tale is this? you bring me to this print,
That I know not what I have done. Ho you sirrah, did not I buy you?

Dorus. You bought me.

Py. Bid him answer me again.

Ph. Ask him.

Py. Did you come to our house to day? be says no: But that other came
Being about sixteen years old, whom Parmeno brought with him.

Ph. Come on,
Now tell me this first, whence had you that sull which you have?
You ugly fellow, will you tell me, or no?

Dorus. Chaerea came.

Ph. My brother?

Dorus. Yes.

Ph. When?

Dor. To day.

Ph. How long ago?

Dor. Just now.

Ph. With whom?

Dor. With Parmeno.

Ph. Did you know him before?

Dor. No.


Ph. How then?
Did you know that he was my brother?

Dor. Parmeno said
That it was he, he gave me this suit.

Ph. I am undone.

Dorus. He put on mine himself, afterward they went both together out of doors.

Py. Do you now sufficiently believe that I am not drunk, and that I have told
no lie?


Ph. Go to now
You great beast, do you believe this fellow what he says?

Py. What should I believe him for?
The deed hears mention.

Ph. Go aside thither a little.
Do you hear? ay but a very little, that is enough: Tell me now this again:
Did Chaerea pull off thy clothes from thee?

Dor. He did so.

Ph.

Dor. He did so.

Ph. And was he brought hither in stead of you?

Dor. Yes.

Ph. O wonderful! O the roguish and audacious fellow!

Py. Woe is me! what do you not yet believe that we have been mocked most basely?

Ph. Its a marvel but you believe what this fellow says. I know not what to do.
Do you hear, sirrah? Deny it again, can I not get the truth out of you to day?
Chaerea?

Dor. No.

Ph. I see, he cannot confess
Without he be punished. Follow me this way. One while he says it, another
while he denies it. Entreat me.

Dor. I beseech you Phaedria.

Ph. Go in a doors.

Dor. Ah welladay!

Ph. I know not,
How by any other means I can come honestly off hence; there is no help, if
these things be true;
Shall you, you knave, make a laughing stock on me here?

Py. I am as sure
Parmeno's, as that I live.

Dor. So it is.

Py. I will find
How I may be even with him to day. But now Dorias, what do you persuade
To be done?

Dor. Do you ask concerning that maid?

Py. Yes,
Whether should I hold my tongue, or tell it abroad?

Dor. Do you, truly if you be wise, not know what you do know;
Neither concerning the Eunuch, nor the deflouring of the maid. By this means
you shall both
Dorus is gone.

Py. So I will.

Dor. But do not I see Chremes? Thais will be here by and by.

Py. Why so?

Dor. Because when I came away thence, just then began a bustle
Betwixt them.

Py. Do you have away the gold: I will know of him what the matter is.

Actus IV. Scen. 4.
Phaedria, Dorus, Pythias, Dorias. Ph. EXiforas, sceleste: at etiam restitas?
fugitive, prodi:
Male conciliate.

Doius. Obsecro.

Ph. Oh, illud vide os
Ut sibi distorsit carnifex. Quid huc reditio est?
Quid vest is mutatio? quid narras? paululum si cessassem,


Py. Habesne hominem amabo?

Ph. Quid ni habeam?

Py. O factum been (...)

Dori. Istuc pol vero been.

Py. Ubi est?

Ph. Rogitas? non vides?

Py. Videam, obsecro, quem?

Ph. Hunc
Scilicet.

Py. Quis homo hic est?

Ph. Qui ad vos


Py. Hunc oculis suis nostrarum nunquam
Quisquam vidit, Phaedria.

Ph. Non vidit?

Py. An tu hunc
Credidisti esse, obsecro, ad nos deductum?

Ph. Nam quem
Alium? habui neminem.

Py. Au, ne comparandus hic
Quidem est ad illum. Ille erat honesta facie and liberali.

Ph.
Nunc ^o tibi videtur faedus, quia illam n^n habet.

Py. Tace obsecro; quasi vero paululum inter^iet. Ad nos
Deductus hodie est adolescentulus, quem tu videre ve^o
Velles, Phaedria: Hic est vietus, vetus, veternosus, fenex, color


Ph. Hem, quae est fabula? co redigis me,
Ut quid egerim ego nesciam. E^o ru, emin' ego te?

Dorus. E^isti.

Py. Jube mihi denuo respondeat.

Ph. Roga.

Py. Venistin' hodie ad nos? nega^. At ille alter venit natus
Annos sedecim, quem secum adduxit Parmeno.

Ph. Agedum,

Vestem? monstrum hominis, number dicturuses?

Dorus. Venit Chaerea.

Ph. Frat^^ne?

Dorus. Ita.

Ph. Quando?

Dor. Hodie.

Ph. Quam dudum?

Dor. Modo.

Ph. Quicum?

Dor. Cum Parmenone.

Ph. Narrasne eum prius?

Dor. Non


Ph. Unde igitur
Fratrem meum esse sciebas?

Dor. Parmeno dicebat
Eum esse: is dedit mihi hanc vestem.

Ph. Occidi.

Dorus. Meam ipse induit, post ambo una abierunt for as.

Py. Jam satis credis sobriam esse me, and nihil mentitam?


Ph. Age nunc
Bellua, credis huic quod dicat?

Py. Quid isti credam?
Res ipsa indicat.

Ph. Concede istue paululum.
Audin etiam nunc paululum; sat est; dic dum hoc rursum,
Chaerea tuam vestem detraxit tibi?

Dor. Factum est.

Ph.

Dor. Factum.

Ph. Et pro te huc deductus est?

Dor. Ita.

Ph. Jupiter magne! O scelestum atque audacem hominem!

Py. Vae mihi; etiam nunc non credis indignis nos esse irrisas modis?

Ph. Mirum, ni tu credas, quid iste dicat; quid agam, nescio. Heus tu,
Negato rursum. Possumne ego hodie ex te exculpere verum?


Dor. Non.

Ph. Video, non potest fateri
Sinc malo. Sequere hac; modo ait, modo negat. Ora me.

Dor. Obsecro te vero Phaedria.

Ph. I intro.

Dor. Hei, hoi.

Ph. Al^o
Pacto honest quomodo hinc abeam, nescio. Actum est, siquidem; tu me
Hic etiam nebulo ludificabere?

Py. Parmenonis tam scio


Dor. Sic est.

Py. Inveniam
Pol hodie parem ubi referam gratiam. Sed nunc quid faciundum
Suades, Dorias?

Dori. De istac virgin rogas?

Py. Ita.
Utrum taceam, an praedicem?

Dor. Tu pol si sapis, quod s^ias, nescis,
Neque de Eunucho, neque de vitio virginis. Hac re and te omni


Py. Ita faciam.

Dor. Sed videon' Chremem? Thais jam aderit.

Py. Quid ita?

Dor. Quia tum inde abeo, jam tum inceperat turba
Inter eos.

Py. Tu aufer aurum: scibo ex hoc quid siet.

Act IV. Scene 5.
Chremes, Pythias. Chapter ALas, in good truth, I am beguiled. The wine that I have
drunk has over-mastered me.
And while I sat at the table, how fine and sober I did think my self to be?
Since I have risen, neither my feet, nor my wit, do as they should do.

Py. Chremes.

Chapter Oh, Pythias. O how much fairer now


P. Truly, you are far more cheerful.

Chapter Certoinly this is a true saying, Without meat and drink lust grows cold.
But Thais came long before.

Py. Is she Gone from the soldiers already?

Chapter Long ago, an age since, there was
A great contention betwixt them.

Py. Did she say nothing then that you should follow her?

Chapter

Py. Why, was not that enough?

Chapter But I did not know that she meant that, but the soldier righted me, which
I did not well understand, for he thrust me out of doors;
But (...) I see her: I wonder where I got before her.

Act. IV. Scena 5.
Chremes, Pythias. Chapter AT at, data hercle verba mihi sunt. Vicit me vinum quod
bibi;
Ac dum accubabam, quam videbar mihi esse pulchre sobrius?
Postquam surrexi, neque pes neque men's satis suum officium facit.

Py. Chreme.

Chapter Ehem Pythia, vah quanto nunc formosior


P. Certe quidem tu pol multo alacrior.

Chapter Verbum hercle hoc verum est, Sine Cerere
Et Libero friget Venus. Sed Thais multo ante venit.

Py. Anne
Abiit jam a milite?

Chapter Jamdudum, aetatem. Lites factae sunt
Inter eos maxumae.

Py. Nihil dixit tum ut sequerere sese?

Chapter

Py. Eho, nonne id sat erat?

Chapter At nesciebam id dicere illam, nisi quia correxit miles; quod
Intellexi minus: nam me extrusit for as.
Sed eccam ipsam video: miror ubi ego huic antevorterim.

Act IV. Scen. 6.
Thais, Chremes, Pythias. Th. I Believe indeed he will be here by and by, that
he may take her
From me; Let him come. But if he touch her with one
Finger, I will presently scratch out his eyes; I can so long abide
His fooleries, and his big words, whilst they are but words; but
If they be turned to deeds, he shall he beaten.

Chapter Thais, I have been
Here a good while.

Th. O my Crhemes! I look for you. Do you know that this bustle
Was made because of you, and that so all the matter concerns you?

Chapter Me, how? as though I made it.

Th. Because whist I labored
To give and restore you your sister again, I have endured these and many the
like things.

Chapter Where is she?

Th. At home at my house.

Chapter Ha.

Th. What is the matter?
She has been brought up so as it befitteth you and her.

Chapter What say you?

Th. As
The matter is, I bestow her on you, and do not demand any thing of you for
her.

Chapter Thais, I both thank you, and will also study to requite you, so as you
have deserved.

Th. But take heed Chremes, that you do not lose her, before you receive her of
me;
For this is she, whom the soldier comes to take from me by force. Pythias,
go you
And fetch the little cabinet out of the house with the tokens.

Chapter Thais, Do you not see him?

Py. Where is it laid?

Th. In the trunk, thru spiteful queen, do thou make no baste?

Chapter Do you not see the soldier, and what forces he brings with him? Alas,
alas.

Th. What man, I pray you, are you faint-hearted? Away, away.

Chapter Am I faint-hearted?
There is no man living less fearful.

Th. And so you have need.

Chapter Alas,
I fear what kind of man you think me to be.

Th. Nay consider this,
^im whom you have to do; he is a stranger, less powerful
Then you, not so well acquainted, having fewer friends here.

Chapter I know that;
But it is a folly to suffer that to be done, which you may avoid. I had rather
We should provide beforehand, then be revenged on him after a wrong is
received:
Go you and lock the door on the inside, whilst I make a step hence to the
market;
I desire we may have some Mediators here in this combustion.

Th. Tarry, tarry.

Chapter It is better.

Th. Tarry.

Chapter Let me go,
I will be here again by and by.

Th. Chremes, we have no need of them. Do but say this,
That she is your sister, and that you lost her when she was a little girl,
That you have now come to the knowledge of her. Let him see the tokens.

Py. They are here.

Th. Lay hold of him: If he shall offer any violence, bring an action against
him. Do you understand me?

Chapter Very well.

Th. See you speak this with a good courage.

Chapter I will.

Th. Take up you cloak about you. Alas, he himself has need of a Counselor,
Whom I have got to defend me.

Thais, Chremes, Pythias. Th. CRedo equidem illum jam jam adfuturum esse, ut
illam a me

Uno, oculi illico effodientur. Usque adeo ego illius far possum
Ineptias and magnifica verba, verba dum sint; verum enim


Chapter Thais, ego jamdudum
Hic adsum.

Th. O mi Chremes, teipsum expecto. Scin' tu turbam
Hanc propter te esse factam, and adeo ad te attinere hanc omnem rem?

Chapter Ad me, qui? quasi istuc.

Th. Quia dum tibi sororem studeo
Reddere ac restituere, haec atque hujusmodi sum multa passa.

Chapter

Th. Domi apud me.

Chapter Hem.

Th. Quid est?
Educta est ita ut teque illaque dignum est.

Chapter Quid ais?

Th. Quod
Res est. Hanc tibi dono do, neque repeto pro illa quicquam abs te pretii.

Chapter Et habetur and referetur, Thaeis, a me ita uti merita es, gratia.

Th. At enim cave, ne priusquam hanc a me accipias, amittas, Chreme,

Pythias, domo effer cum monumentis.

Chapter Viden' tu illum, Thais?

Py. Ubi sita est.

Th. In risco; odiosa cessas?

Chapter Militem fecum
Atque quantas copias adducere? At, at.

Th. Number formidolosus
Obsecro es, mi homo? apagesis.

Chapter Egon' formidolosus?


Th. Aque ita opus est.

Chapter Au,
Metuo qualem tu me hominem esse existumes.

Th. Immo hoc
Cogitato, quicum res tibi est, peregrinus est, minus potens
Quam tu minus notus, minus amicorum hic habens.

Chapter Scio
Isthuc, sed tu quod cavere possis stultum est admittere. Malo ego

Atque obsera ostium intus, dum ego hinc transcurro ad forum.
Volo hic ego addesse advocatos nobis in turba hac.

Th. Mane, mane.

Chapter Melius est.

Th. Mane.

Chapter Omit,
Jam adero.

Th. Nihil opus est istis, Chreme. Hoc modo die

Nunc cognosse; signa ostende.

Py. Adsunt.

Th. Cape,
Si vim faciet, in jus ducito hominem. Intellextin'?

Chapter Probe.

Th. Fac animo haec praesenti dicas.

Chapter Faciam.

Th. Attolle pallium. Phy, huic ipsi opus patrono est, quem


Act 4. Scene 7.
Thraso, Gnatho, Sanga, Chremes, Thais. Thr. GNatho, Is it fit that, I should
put up this so notable abuse offered me?
It is better for me to die. Simalio, Dorax, Syriscus,
M^rch after me. First of all I will pull down the house.

G. Very well.

Th. I will take the maid away by force.

G. Exceeding well.

Thr. I will punish her sharply.

G. Bravely spoken!

Thr. Dorax, come hither, into the middle of the army with the door-bar.
Do you Simalio, march into the left wing; and you, Syriscus, into the right.
Give me the rest.
Where is Captain Sanga, and his company of slaves?

S. Look at him,
Here he is.

Thr. What, you coward, do you think to fight with a di^^clout,
That you bring it hither?

Sang. What I? I know the vatour of my General,

Without blood shed, and therefore I brought to wipe their wounds.

Thr. Where are the others?

Sang. What others with a mischief? None but Sannio
Keeps the house.

Thr. Do, set these in array here. And I being behind
The Vaunt-guard will thence give the Word to all.

Gn. That is a wise part:


Th. This same thing.
Now Pyrrhus was wont to do.

Chapter Do you not see Thais,
What thing he does? Certainly that was very good counsel which I gave you
About shutting up the door.

Th. That which seems to you now a a gallant fellow,
Is but this great boobie? do not fear him.

Thr. What do you think?

Gn.
Out of this close place; they would run away.

Thr. But look where I see
Thais her self.

Gn. How quickly do we fall in upon them?

Thr. Tarry: It becomes
A wise man to try all things by words rather then arms. How know you, whether
She will do what I command her without compulsion or not?

Gn. O strange!


Thr. First and foremost, answer me this, when I gave you that maid,
Did not you say, you would keep me only company these days?

Th. And what then?

Thr. Do you ask? who have brought me your lover here present before your eyes.

Th. What can you do to him?

Thr. And conveyed your self-with him privily from me.

Th.

Thr. Therefore give me Pamphila again hither.
Except you had rather her taken from you by force.

Th. Should she give her you, or ought you to meddle with her you errant rascal?

Gn. Ah, what do you do? hold your tongue. What mean you?

Thr. Ought not I meddle
With my own?

Chapter What yours you rogue!

Gn. Have a care, you know not
What a man you now give ill words to.

Chapter Do you get you gone hence? Do you know

I will make you always remember this place, and day, and me too.

Gn. I am sorry for you, that you make such a worthy man as this your enemy.

Chapter I will break your pate by and by, unless you be gone.

Gn. Say you so indeed you cur; do you do so?

Thr. What fellow are you?


Chapter You shall know.
First I say she is a free woman.

Thr. Ha.

Chapter A Citizen of Athens.

Thr. Whoo.

Chapter My own sister.

Thr. You impudent fellow!

Chapter Soldier,
Moreover I charge you, that you offer no violence toward her. I am going
To Sophrona the nurse, to fetch her, and show her these tokens.

Thr.

Chapter I forbid you,
I say.

Gn. Do you hear? This man accuses himself of felony,
Is not this sufficient for you?

Thr. Do you say so too, Thais?

Th. Go look some body
That may answer you.

Thr. What do we now?

Gn. Marry let us go back again,
She will come to you by and by, beseeching you on her own accord.

Thr. Think you so?

Gn. Yes,

They fain will with all their heart.

Thr. You think rightly.

Gn. I will now disband the army.

Thr. When you will.

Gn. Sanga, as becomes valiant soldiers, see
You remember to do at home, and by the fireside.

Sang. My mind is in the pottage pot
Long ago.

Gn. You are an honest fellow.

Sang. March after me this way.

Act IV. Scen. 7.
Thraso, Gnatho, Sanga, Chremes, Thais. Thr. HAnccine ego ut contumeliam tam
insignem in me accipiam,
Gnatho? Mori me satius est. Simalio, Dorax, Syrisce,
Sequimini. Primum aedes expugnabo.

G. Recte.

Thr. Virginem eripiam.

G. Probe.

Thr. Male mulctabo ipsam.

G.

Thr. In medium huc agmen cum vecti Dorax;
Tu, Simalio, in sinistrum cornu; tu, Syrisce, in dexterum. Cedo alios.
Ubi centurio est Sanga, and manipulus furum?

S. Eccum
Adest.

Thr. Quid, ignave, peniculon' pugnare, qui
Istum huc portas, cogitas?

Sang. Egone? imperatoris

Hoc non posse fieri, qui abstergerem vulnera.

Thr. Ubi alii?

Sang. Qui malum alii? solus Sannio servat
Domum.

Thr. Tu hosce instrue hic. Ego vero post
Principia, inde omnibus signum dabo.

Gn. Illuc est sapere:


Thr. Idem hoc
Jam Pyrrhus factitavit.

Chapter Viden' tu, Thais,
Quam hic remagit? nimirum concilium illud rectum est
De occludendis aedibus.

Th. Sane, quod tibi nunc vir videatur
Esse, hic nebulo magnus est, ne metuas.

Thr. Quid videtur?

Gn.
Ex occulto caederes; facerent fugam.

Thr. Sed eccam Thaidem
Ipsam video.

Gn. Quam mox irruimus?

Thr. Mane. Omnia
Prius experi^i verbis quam armis sapientem decet. Qui scis, an
Quae jubeam sine vi faciat?

Gn. Dii vestram fidem! quanti est


Thr. Thais, primum hoc mihi responde, cum tibi do istam virginem,
Dixtin', hos dies mihi soli dare te?

Th. Quid tum postea?

Thr. Rogitas? quae mihi ante oculos tuos coram amatorem adduxisti tuum?

Th. Quid cum illo agas?

Thr. Et cum eo cla n te subduxisti mihi.

Th.

Thr. Pamphilam ergo huc read, nisi vi mavis
Eripi.

Chapter Tibi illam reddat, aut tu eam tangas, omnium?

Gn. Ah, quid agis? tace. Quid tu tibi vis?

Thr. Ego non tangam

Chapter Tuam autem, furcifer?

Gn. Cave sis, Nescis cui
Maledicas nunc viro.

Thr. Quis tu homo es?

Inquam.

Gn. Audin' tu? hic furti se alligat,

Thr. Idem tu hoc ais, Thais?

Th. Quaere,

Thr. Quid nunc agimus?

Gn. Quin redeamus? jam haec
Tibi aderit supplcans ultro.

Thr. Credin'?

Gn. Immo

Cupiunt ultro.

Thr. Been putas.

Gn. Jam dimitto exercitum.

Thr. Ubi vis.

Fac vicissim ut memineris.

Sang. Vos me hac sequimini.

Act V. Scene 1.
Thais, Pythias, Th. DO you go on to talk doubtfully, you errant queen?
I know, I know not: I heard it: I was not there.
Will not you tell it me plainly, whatsoever it is?
The maid with her clothes rent, is weeping, and says not a word.
The Eunuch is gone: why so? what is done, do thou not speak?

Py. What should I poor woman say to you? they say it was not An Eunuch.

Th. Who was it then?

Py. That same Chaerea.

Th. What, Chaerea?

Py. That young stripling Phaedria' s brother.

Th. What say you, you witch!

Py. But I have found it to be true.

Th. How, I pray you, came he to our house, or wherefore was he brought?

Py. I know not, but I that think he loved Pamphila.

Th. Alas, I am undone, poor woman!
I am unfortunate, if those things be true which you say.
Why does the maid weep?

Py. For that I suppose.

Th. What say you,
You wicked queen? Did not I give you charge about that, when I went away
hence?

15r
Py. What should I do? she was committed to him alone, as you gave order.

Th. You queen, you committed a sheep to a wolf; I am ashamed
That I should be thus deceived: What fellow is it?

Py. Mistress, hold your tongue, I pray you, we are well enough.
We have the man himself.

Th. Where is he?

Py. Look you, on your left hand.
Do you not see him?

Th. I do see him.

Py. Cause him to be laid hold on, as soon as you can.

Th. You fool, what shall we do to him?

Py. What should I do, do you ask?
See, I pray you, if when you look on him, he seem not to be a shameless
person,

Th. He is not; besides, how very confident is he?

Act. V. Scen. 1.
Thais, Pythias. Th. PErgin' scelesta mecum perplexe loqui?
Scio, nescio: abiit: audivi: ego non assui.
Non tu istuc mihi dictura a perre es, quicquid est?
Virgo, conscissa vest, lachrymans obticet.


Py. Quid tibi ego dicam misera? illum Eunuchum negant Fuisse.

Th. Quis fuit igitur?

Py. Iste Chaerea.

Th. Qui Chaerea.

Py. Iste ephebus frater Phaedriae.

Th. Quid ais, venefica?

Py. Atqui certe-repperi.

Th.

Py. Nescio; nisi amasse credo Pamphilam.

Th. Hem, misera, occidi.
Infoelix, siquidem tu istaec vera praedicas.
Quid lacrymat virgo?

Py. Id opinor.

Th. Quid ais,
Sacrilega? Istuccine interminat^^ sum hinc abiens tibi?

Py.

Th. Scelesta, ovem lupo commisisti; dispudet,
Sic mihi data esse verba; quid illic hominis est?

Py. Hera mea, tace obsecro, salvae sumus.
Habemus hominem ipsum.

Th. Ubi is est?

Py. He^, ad fini^.


Th. Video.

Py. Comprehendi jube, quantum potes.

Th. Quid illi faciemus, stulta?

Py. Quid faciam, rogas?
Vide amabo, si non, cum aspicias, os impudens
Videtur.

Th. Non est, tum quae ejus confidentia est?

Actus V. Scen. 2.
Chaerea, Thais, Pythias. Chapter AT Antipho' s house, both his mother and father
Were at home, as if it had been for the nonce, so as I could
By no means go in, but they must see me. In the mean time
Whilst I was standing at the door, an acquaintance of mine
Came and met me; when he saw me, I betook me to my heels as fast as I could,
Into a back corner where no body dwelt, and from that
Into another, and thence into another; so I became most wretched
In running away, for fear any body should know me.
But is this Thais, which I see? it is she. I am at a stand.
What shall I do? what is it to me? what will she do to me?

Th. Let us go to him. Good man Dorus, God save you: tell me, did you run away?

Chapter Mistress, I did so.

Th. Do you like that very well?

Chapter No.

Th. Did you think you should go scot-free?

Chapter Forgive me this one fault,
And if ever I do any more, I will give you leave to kill me.

Th. Was you afraid of my cruelty?

Chapter No.

Th. What then?

Chapter I was afraid of this woman, lest she should accuse me unto you.

Th. What had you done?

Chapter A very small matter.

Th. Ah you shameless fellow, a small matter? Do you think it
A small matter to defile a maid that is a Citizen?

Chapter I took her to be my fellow servants.

Py. Your fellow servants? I can scarce refrain my self
But I must fly about his ears; the ugly knave besides
Comes voluntarily to mock us.

Th. Can you be gone you mad girl?

Py. Why forsooth
Should I go hence? should I believe that rogue in any thing? especially
When he confesses himself to be your servant?

Th. Let us see these things pass: Chaerea, you have not done
As it became you; For though I very well deserve to have
This abuse, yet you was an unmeet person to do it.
Neither indeed do I know what course to take
About this maid; you have put me to such a nonplus,
That I cannot restore her to her friends,
So as it was fitting; and as I endeavored,
That I might gain my self thanks for a complete benefit, Chaerea.

Chapter But I hope there will be henceforward a continual amity
Betwixt us, Thais; for often times from some such thing as this is,
And from a bad beginning, great acquaintance
Has grown. What if some God would have it thus?

Th. Truly I construe it in that sense, and wish it may be so.

Chapter Nay, I pray you, understand this one thing, that I did not do it
To abuse you, but out of love.

Th. I know it.
And therefore indeed I the rather pardon you.
I am not of so unkind a nature, Chaerea,
Nor so unexperienced, that I should not be able to know, what love can do.

Chapter Thais, I swear, I love you too.

Py. Then, Mistress, I perceive you had need to take heed of this fellow.

Chapter I dare not be so bold.

Py. I do not trust you any whit at all.

Th. Give over.

Chapter Thais, I commit and commend my self to your fidelity.
Now I beseech you be my helper in this matter.
I desire you to be my patroness, and I beseech you:
I wish I were dead, if I do not marry her hereafter.

Th. Yet if you father.

Chapter What! I am sure be will be willing,
If so be she be but a Citizen.

Th. Tarry here a little
If you will; the maids brother will be here by and by:
He went to fetch the nurse, which nursed her when she was a little one.
Chaerea, you your self shall be by at the owning of her.

Chapter I will indeed tarry.

Th. Will you, in the mean time whilst he come,
That we tarry at home rather, than here before the door?

Chapter Yes, I am heartily willing to it.

Py. I pray you, what are you going to do?

Th. For why?

Py. Do you ask? Do you think to entertain this fellow Into the house
hereafter?

Th. Why not?

Py. Take this on my word, 60. He will make some bustle again.

Th. Tush, I pray thee, hold thy tongue.

Py. You seem not to have observed his boldness.

Chapter Pythias, I will no do so.

Py. Truly, Chaetea, I do not trust you; Unless it be in a thing not committed
to you.

Chapter But, Pythias,
Do you look to me.

Py. Truly I dare neither commit any thing to you
To keep, nor take charge of you. Away with you.

Th. Her brother is here in good time.

Chapter Truly I am undone, I pray you
Let us go hence in adoors, Thais. I am loath he should see me
In the street with these clothes.

Th. Why so, for sooth; is it because you are ashamed?

Chapter That is the matter.

Py. That is the matter? a maid I warrant you?

Th. Go before, I will come after:
do you stay there, that you may bring in Chremes.

Ut solidum pararem hoc mihi beneficium, Chaerea.

Fore, Thais: saepe ex hujusmodi re quapiam,

Conflata est. Quid si hoc quispiam voluit Deus?

Th. Equidem pol in eam partem accipioque and volo.

Chapter Immo ita quaeso, unum hoc scito, contumeliae
Non me fecisse causa, sed amoris.

Th. Scio,

Non adco inhumano sum ingenio, Chaerea,

What? how shall I requite that wicked fellow,
That put him upon us?

Chapter Stir you self apace,
Nurse.

S. I stir.

Chapter I see that, but you make no riddance.

Py. Have you showed the tokens already to the nurse?

Chapter All.

Py. I pray you, what says she? does she know them?

Chapter Yes, and remembers them too.

Py. Truly you tell me good news, for I wish the maid well.
Go ye in, my Mystress has looked for you at home a good while ago.
But look, I see that honest man Parmeno go along.
Do you see how leisurely he goes, forsooth.
I hope I have got a trick, how to vex him after my own fashion.
I will go in, that I may know the certainty about the owning of her:
Afterward I will come forth, and terrify this wicked varlet.

Act V. Scene 4.
Parmeno, Pythias. Par. I Come again to see what Chaerea does here;
For if he have cunningly carried the matter, O strange!
What and how real commendations shall Parmeno get?
For to let that pass, that I have gotten him his love, which was very hard,
and
Dear to purchase of a covetous whore, that maid which he loved, Without any
trouble, without any charge, without any loss: That other thing;
That indeed is it which I think I deserve the garland for,
That I have found, how a young man may know
The dispositions and behavior of whores;
That when one knows them betimes, he may hate them for ever;
Who whilst they are ahroad, nothing in the world is more cleanly,
Nor any thing more demure, nor more neat;
Who when they sup with their lover, feed nicely; but
How nasty they are at home, by themselves, and greedy of neat;
After what fashion they sosse brown-bread out of cock-crown pottage:
To know all these things is a making to young men.

Py. You rogue, I will indeed be revenged on you for those your sayings,
And doings; that you may not play upon us scot-free.

Actus V. Scen. 4.
Parmeno, Pythias. Par. REviso, quidnam Chaerea hic rerum gerat,
Quod si astu rem tractavit, Dii vostram fidem!
Quantam and quam veram laudem capiet Parmeno?
Nam ut mittam, quod and amorem difficillimum, and

Quam amabat, came confeci sine molestia,
Sine sumptu, sine dispendio: Tum hoc alterum,
Id vero est quod ego mihi puto palmarium,
Me reperisse, quomodo adolescentulus
Meretricum ingenia and mores posset noscere:

Quae dum for is sunt, nihil videtur mundius,
Nee magis compositum quidquam, nec magis elegans:
Quae cum amatore cum coenant, liguriunt:
Harum videre ingluviem, sordes, inopiam,
Quam inhonestae solae sint domi, a^que avidae cibi,

Nosse omnia haec, salus est adolescentulis.

Py. Ego pol te pro is it is dictis and factis, scelus,
Ulciscar, ut ne impune in nos illuseris.

Act V. Scene 5.
Pythias, Parmeno. Py. O Wonderful strange, an ugly prank! that unhappy
young man! O roguish Parmeno, who brought him hither?

Par. What is the matter?

Py. It pitieth me to see it, and therefore I poor woman can hither out of
doors, that I might not see it.
What examples do they think shall be made of him, which are not sor him?

Par. O Jupiter,
What ado is there? am not I undone? I will go to her: What is the matter,
Pythias!
What say you? on whom shall examples be made?

Py. Do you ask, you bold fellow?
You have undone that young man whom you brought instead of the Eunuch,
Whilst you strive to begule us.

Par. Why so, or what is done, tell me?

Py. I will tell you: That maid which was given for a present to Tha is to day;
Do you know that she is a Citizen here hence, and that her brother is a great
Gentleman?

Par. I know it not.

Py. But she is found so to be, the poor youth has defloured her,
When her brother being a very passionate man knew these things.

Par. What did he?

Py. First, he bound him after a pitiful manner.

Par. Bound him, what now?

Py. And indeed when Thais entreated him that he would not do it.

Par. What say you?

Py. Now he threatens moreover that he will do, as is used to be done to
whoremasters;
A thing which I never saw to be done, nor desire to see.

Par. With what confidence
Dares he to attempt so great a villainy?

Py. Why so great?

Par. Do not you think it a very great one?
What man ever saw one taken for a whoremaster
In a baudie house?

Py. I know not.

Par. But Pythias, that ye may not but know this,
I tell you, and tell you plainly, that he is our masters son.

Py. Alas,
I pray you is it he?

Par. Let not Thais suffer any wrong to be done to him,
And withal, why do not I my self go in?

Py. Have a care Parmeno,
What you do, lest you do him no good, but undo your self; for they think
this,
What ever it is that is done, to be long of you.

Par. What then shall I do poor man,
Or what shall I begin? but lo I see the old man coming out of the country
again,
Should I tell him, or not? Truly I will tell him though I know some great harm
Attends me. But it is necessary that he should help him.

Py. You are wise,
I am going in. Do you tell him all the matter in order: how it was done.

Act. V. Scen. 5.
Pythias, Parmeno. Py. PRo Deum fidem, facinus foedumio infoelicem
adolescentulum! O scclestum Parmenonem, qui istum huc adduxit?

Par. Quid est?

Py. Miscret me: itaque ut ne viderem, misera huc effugi for as.
Quae futura exempla dicunt in eum indigna?

Par. O Jupiter,

Quid ais, in quem exempla sient?

Py. Rogitas audacissime?
Perdidisti istum, quem adduxti pro Eunucho, adolescentulum,
Dum studes dare verba nobis.

Par. Quid ita? aut quid factum est, cedo.

Py. Dicam; virginem istam, Thaidi hodie quae dono data est,


Par. Nescio.

Py. Atqui sic inventa est, came iste vitiavit miser,
Ille ubi haec rescivit frater violentissimus.

Par. Quidnam fecit?

Py. Pri^um cum miseris modis.

Par. Colligavit? Hem!

Py. Atque equidem orante, ut ne id faceret, Thaide.

Par.

Py. Nunc minitatur porro sese id facturum, quod maechis solet,
Quod ego nunquam vidi fieri, neque velim.

Par. Qua audacia tantum
Facinus audet?

Py. Quid ita tantum?

Par. Annon tibi hoc maxumum?
Quis homo pro maecho unquam vidit in domo meretricia
Deprehendi quenquam?

Py. Nescio.

Par. At ne hoc nesciatis, Pythias,


Py. Hem!
Obsecro an is est?

Par. Ne quam in illum Thais vim fieri sinat.
Atque adeo autem, cur non egomet int^o eo?

Py. Vide, Parmeno,
Quid agas, ne neque illi prosis, and tu pereas; nam hoc putant,
Quicquid factum est, a te esse ortum.

Par. Quid igitur faciam miser?

Dicam huic, an non? Dicam hercle, etsi mihi magnum malum
Scio paratum. S^d necesse est ut huic subveniat.

Py. Sapis,
Ego abeo intro. Tu isti narrato omnem rem ordine, ut factum est.

Act V. Scen. 6.
Lathes, Parmeno. La. I Get this benefit by my conntrey farm which lies near
the city, I never ^feel^ any wearisomness either of the^ country or
When I begin to be weary, I change my place.
But is not this Parmeno? Certainly, it is even be:
Parmeno, here before the door?

Par. What man is that? Ho master, you are welcome hither.

La. Whom do you tarry for Parmeno? I am undone. I am not able
To speak for fear.

La. Ha, what is the matter, why do you tremble?
Are they all well? tell me.

Par. Master, I would first have you to think

Is not done through my fault.

La. What is it?

Par. You have done well to ask.
I should have told you the matter before hand. Phaedria bought an Eunuch,
Which he bestowed on this woman.

La. On whom?

Par. On Thais.

La. Has he bought one?
Without doubt I am undone; for how much?

Par. For twenty pounds.

La. There is no remedy.

Par. Chaerea is in love here with a minstrelless.

La. How now, what?
Is he in love, does he know already what a whore means? is he come to the
town?
One mischief comes on the neck of another.

Par. Master, do not look on me,
He does not these things at my setting on.

La. Speak no more of your self, you rogue,
If I live, I will; but first tell me this whatsoever it is.

Par. He was brought
Thais instead of that Eunuch.

La. Instead of the Eunuch.

Par. Yes, Afterward they apprehended him within, in stead of the Eunuch, and
bound him.

La. I am undone.

Par. See the boldness of these whores.

La. Is there any more
Mischief or harm besides, which you have not told me?

Par. This is all.

La. Do I forbear to break in hither within upon them?

Par. There is no doubt, but some

I am glad that any mischief is like to befall these by my means.
For the old man now a long time has fought some occasion,
How he might play them some not able trick: and now he has found one.

Actus V. Scen. 6.
Laches, Parmeno. La EX meo propinquo rure, hoc capio commodi, Neque agri n^que
urbis odium me unquam percipit.
Ubi satias coepit fieri, commuto locum.
Sed estne ille Parmeno? and certe ipsus est.


Par. Quis homo est? Ehem, salvum te advenisse, here, gaudeo.

La. Quem praestolare, Parmeno?

Par. Perii. Metu
Lingua haeret.

La. Ehem, quid est? quid tu trepidas?
Satin' salvae? dic mihi.

Par. Here, primum te arbitrari

Culpa non factum est mea.

La. Quid?

Par. Recte sane interrogasti.
Oportuit rem praenarrasse me. Emit quendam Phaedria Eunuchum,
Quem dono huic daret.

La. Cui?

Par. Thaidi.

La. Emit? Perii
Hercle; quanti*

Par. Viginti minis.

La. Actum est.

Par. Tum


La. Ehem, quid?
Amat? an scit jam ille quod meretrix siet; an in astu venit?
Aliud ex alio malum.

Par. Here, ne me spectes, me impulsore
Haec non facit.

La. Omit de te dicere; ego te, furcifer,
Si vivo; sed istud quicquid est primum expedi.

Par. Is pro illo


L. Pro Eunuchon'?

Par. Sic est. Hunc pro Eunucho postea comprehendere intus and constrinxere.

La. Occidi.

Par. Audaciam meretricum specta.

La. Numquid est
Aliud mali damnive, quod non dixeris, reliquum?

Par. Tantum est.

La. Cesso huc intro irrumpere?

Far. Non dubium est quin mihi magnum

Id gaudeo propter me hisce aliquid esse eventurum mali:
Nam jam diu aliquam causam quaerebat senex,
Quamobrem insigne aliquid faceret iis: nunc repperit.

Act V. Scene 7.
Pythias, Parmeno. Py. TRuly never any thing happened to me this many a day,
Which I more desired might happen, then that the old man came just now in into
our house being mistaken.
He was a laughing stock to me only, who knew what he feared.

Par. But what is the matter?

Py. Now I come forth, that I may speak with Parmeno.


Par. Does she seek for me?

Py. And lo I see him.
I will go to him.

Par. What is the matter you foolish girl? what would you have? what do you
laugh at? Do you go on?

Py. I am undone,
I am weary already poor woman with laughing at you.

Par. Why so?

Py. Do you ask?
I never saw, nor never shall see a foolisher fellow then you are; ah
It cannot be sufficiently told what sport you have made within:


Par. What is the matter?

Py. Must you needs presently believe those things which I told you?
Did it not repent you of the wicked act, which the young man had done,
By your advice, unless you must further bewray the poor man to his father?
For what heart do you think he had then, when his father saw him


Par. Ha, what say you, you errant queen? did you tell me a lie? what do you
laugh?
Do you think it such a fine trick to mock us, you drab!

Py. A very fine one.

Par. If you can escape scot-free with that.

Py. But what can you do?

Par. I will requite you.

Py. I think so. But Parmeno, that which you threaten me perhaps is for a long
time to come;

By such villainous deeds, and bewray him too: They will both of them make you
an example.

Par. I am quite undone.

Py. This is the honor you are like to have for that service. I am gone.

Par. I poor man am undone to day, like a rat, by my own squeaking.

Actus V. Scen. 7.
Pythias, Parmen^* Py. NUnqua^ aedipol quidquam jam diu, quod magis vellem
evenire,
Mihi evenit, quam quod modo senex intro ad nos venit errans.
Mihi soli ridiculo fuit, quae quid timeret sciebam.

Par. Quid hoc autem est?

Py. Nunc id prodeo, ut conveniam Parmenonem.


Par. Me quaerit haec?

Py. Atque eccum video.
Adibo.

Par. Quid est, inepta? quid tibi vis? quid rides? Pergin'?

Py. Perii,
Defessa jam sum misera te ridendo.

Par. Quid ita?

Py. Rogitas?
Nunquam pol hominem stultiorem vidi, nec videbo; ah,
Non satis potest narrari quos ludos praebueris intus:


Par. Quid?

Py. Illi^one credere ea, quae dixi, oportuit te?
An poenitebat flagitii, te authore, quod fecisset
Adolescens, ni miserum insuper etiam patri indicares?
Nam quid illi credis animi tum fuisse, ubi vestem vidit


Par. Ehem, quid dixti, pessuma? an mentita es? etiam rides?
Itan' lepidum tibi visum est scelus, nos irridere?

Py. Nimium.

Par. Siquidem istuc impune habueris.

Py. Verum.

Par. Reddam hercle.

Py. Credo, sed in diem istuc Parmeno est fortasse, quod minitare:

Nobilitas flagiriis, and cundem indicas: uterque exempla in te edent.

Par. Nullus sum.

Py. Hic pro illo tibi munere honos est habitus. Abco.

Par. Egomet meo indicio miser, quasi forex, hodie perii.

Act. V. Scene 8.
Gnatho, Thraso. Gn. WHat now, with what hope, or to what intent go we hither?
what do you attempt Thraso?

Thr. What I? that I may yield my self to Thais, and do as she bids me.

Gn. What is that?

Thr. May I not as well serve her, as Hercules served Omphale:

Gn. I like the example: I wish I may see your head broken with her slipper.


Thr. But what mischief is this?
I never saw this fellow yet; why does he skip forth so hastily?

Act. V. Scena 8.
Gnatho, Thraso. Gn. QUid nunc! qua spe, aut quo consilio huc imus? quid
incoeptas Thraso?

Thr. Egone? ut Thaidi me dedam, and faciam quod jubeat.

Gn. Quid est?

Thr. Qui minus huic, quam Hercules servivit Omphalae?

Gn. Exemplum placet. Utinam tibi commitigari videam sandalio caput.


Thr. Quid autem hoc est mali?
Hunc ego nunqua^ videram etiam; quidnam hic properans prosilit?

Act V. Scen. 9.
Chaerea, Parmeno, Phaedria, Gnatho, Thraso. Ch O Country men, is any man
living more happy then I?
Truly no man at all, for the gods have plainly showed all their power
On me, to whom so many good things have come together on such a sudden.

Par. Why is he so merry?

Chapter O my Parmeno, O thou that art the inventer,

Do you know that my Pamphila is found to be a citizen?

Ph. I have heard so.

Chapter And
Do you know that she is my bride?

Par. It is well done, I swear.

Gn. Do you not hear what he says?

Chapter Besides I am glad for my brother Phaedria,
That all his love is secure: there is but one house;
Thais commended her self into my fathers protection and fidelity.
She has yielded her self to us.

Par. Then Thais is wholly your brothers.

Chapter Yes.
Now this is another thing whereof we may be glad; the Soldier is driven out of
doors:
Then do you see, that my brother wherever he is, may hear of these things as
soon as may be.

Par. I will go see for him at home.

Thr. Do you make any doubt now Gnatho, but that I am undone for ever?

Gn.

Chapter What, shall I mention the first, or whom should I most
Commend? Him that gave me advice to do it, or my self that durst adventure
To begin? or should I extol fortune, which was my conductress?
Which has brought to pass so many things, so great, so fitly, all in one day?
Or shall I commend my fathers pleasantness, and courteous behavior?


Ph. O strange! what incredible things did Parmeno tell me even now?
But where is my brother?

Chapter He is at hand.

Ph. I am glad of it.

Chapter I verily believe so.
Brother, there is nothing in the world deserves more to be loved, than this
your Thais,
She is such a fautrix to all our family.

Ph. Whoo, do you commend her to me?

Thr. I am undone.
Gnatho help me,
My hope hangs on thee.

Gn. What would you have me do?

Thr. Bring this to pass
By entreaty or for money, that I may have some share in Thais's favor now at
last.

G. It is a hard matter?

Thr. If you have any list, I knew you what you can do:
If you will but do it, ask what gift or reward you will, and you shall have it
at a wish.

G.

Thr. It shall be so.

G. If I bring it to pass, I desire this, that your house
May be open to me, whether you be present, or absent, that I may always have
a place, though I be uninvited.

Thr. I give you my word it shall be so.

G. I will go about it.

Ph. Whom do I hear here?
O Thraso!

Thr. God save you.

Ph. Perhaps you do not know what things are done here.

Thr. I do know.

Ph. Why then do I see you in these quarters?

Thr.

Ph. Do you know how you rely? Soldier, I tell you plainly,
If I find you in this street ever hereafter, it shall not avail you to say to
me I was seeking another man,
I was passing this way; you are but a dead man.

Gn. Soft, it does not become you to do so.

Ph. I have said it.

Gn. I am not acquainted with your proud behavior.

Ph. I shall be so.

Gn. First, hear me a few words, which when I shall have said, do as you please.

Ph.

Gn. Do you Thraso, go aside thither a little. First, I would fain have you
Both believe me this, that whatsoever I do in this matter,
I do it chiefly for my own sake; but if it be also beneficial to you, it is a
folly
For you not to do it.

Ph. What is that?

Gn. I think the royal soldier ought to be entertained.

Ph. What, to be entertained?

Gn. Do but consider of it; Phaedria, you indeed

You have but little to give, and Thais must of necessity receive much,
That she may be able to maintain your love without your cost.
For all these purposes, there is no man more fit, or more for your use.
First, he both has what to give, and no body gives more freely then he.

And you need not fear lest the woman should love him, you may easily drive him
away, when you will.

Ph. What do we do?

Gn. Besides, this also which I think to be a very main matter,
There is no body entertaineth a man better, nor more lavishly at all.

Ph. It is a wonder if we shall not have need of that man one way or other.

Chapter I think so to.

Gn.
Into your company; I have labored about this long enough.

Ph. We entertain you.

Chapter And with all our hearts.

Gn. But I Phaedria, you Chaerea for this favor
Will deliver him up to you to be devoured, and made a fool on.

Chapter Content.

Ph. He deserves it.

G. Thraso, come hither when you will.

Thr. I pray you what do we?

G.
And commended you according to your deeds, and virtuous qualities:
I have obtained my request.

Thr. It is well done of you, I thank you heartily:
I was never yet in any place, but every body loved me very well.

G. Did not I tell you, that this man did roll in Rherorick?

Ph.

Thr. Perii.

In te spes est.

Gn. Quid vis. faciam?

Thr. Perfice hoc precibus,
Pretio, ut haeream in part aliqua tandem apud Thaidem.

Gn. Difficile est.

Thr. Si quid collibuit, novi te. Si effeceris,
Quidvis donum and praemium a me optato, id optatum feres.

Gn.

Thr. Sic erit.

Gn. Si effecero, hoc postulo, ut tua mihi domus,

The Argument or Plot of Heautontimorumenos, By Cajus Sulpitius Apollinaris.
A Harsh Father enforced his Son Clinia, that was in love
With Antiphila, to go to be a Soldier;
And being sorry for what he had done, he vexed himself.
After he returned, within a while, he went to lodge with Clitipho,
Unwitting to his Father: this Clitipho loved the whore Bacchis.
When Clinia sent for his desired Antiphila,
Bacchis came as his sweat-heart, and Antiphila apparelled
Like a waiting-maid. This was done that Clitipho
Might conceal the matter from his Father. He by Syrus's subtle tricks,
Gets ten Pounds from the old man, to bestow on the Whore.
Antiphila is found to be Clitipho's sister,
Clinia takes her to wise, and Clitipho another woman.

The Prologue.
THat none of you may wonder, why the Poet has allotted
These parts to an old man, which belong unto young men,
I will first tell you that, and afterward I will show you why I came.
This day I am to act a whole Comedy called Heautontimorumenos,
Translated out of a whole Greek one;
Which is become double of a single Subject.
I have showed it to be a new one, and what it is: now, who writ it,
And whose it was in Greek, but that I think the greatest part of you
To know already, I would tell it you.
I will tell you now in few words, wherefore I have learned to act this part;
The Poet was desirous to have me to be an Orator, not a Pro^ogue:
He has appealed to your judgment, he has made me an Actor.
But I wish this Actor could be able to do as much by his eloquence,
As he is able to invent wittily,
Who writ this speech, which I am about to utter.
For whereas ill-willed persons have spread reports abroad,
That he has spoiled many Greek Comedies, whilst he makes
A few Latin ones: He does not deny that he did it,
Neither is he sorry for it, and supposes he may do so again.
He has the example of good men to follow; by which example
He thinks it may be lawful for him to do that which they have done.
Besides, whereas the old ill-willed Poet uses to say,
That he set his mind to Poetry on a sudden,
Presuming on the wit of his friends, not his own inclination:
Your ownjudgment, your own opinion
Shall prevail in the business. Wherefore I would desire you all,
That the speech of partial men may not prevail more with you, then of them
that are impartial:
See you prove indifferent. Give them liberty to make more new Comedies,
That grant you liberty to look at them, being
Without mistakes. Let not him think that this is spoken on his behalf,
Who lately made the people to give way to a servant
Running in the street; why should they yield to a mad fellow?
He will tell more concerning his faults, when he shall set out
Other new Comedies, except he give over his railing.
Show your selves indifferent: give me liberty
That I may act a quiet Comedy without noise;
That always a running servant, a testy old man,
A greedy Parasite, and a shameless sycophant,
A covetous bawd, may not be daily acted by an old man
With a very loud speaking, and a great deal of pains.
For my sake, persuade your selves that this is a lawful excuse,
That some of my pains may be eased.
For now adays, they that write new comedies, make no spare of an old man;
If any Comedy be toylsome, they run to me with it;
But if it be easy, it is presently carried to another company.
In this Comedy is a pure style; Try
What my wit can do for one as well as the other:
If I never in a covetous manner set a price of my skill,
And always thought in my mind that that was my greatest gain,
To attend upon your profiting as much as might be possible,
Let me be an example, that young men
May strive rather to please you, than themselves.
Prologus.
NE cui sit vestrum mirum, cur parts seni
Poeta dederit, quae sunt adolescentium,
Id primum dicam: deinde quod veni, cloquar.
Ex integra Graeca integram Comaediam
Hodie sum actuius Heautotimorumenon,
Duplex quae ex argumento facta est simplici.
Novam esse ostendi, and quae esset: nunc, qui scripserit,
Et cuja Graeca sit, ni partem maxumam
Existimarem scire vestrum, id dicerem.
Nunc, quamobrem has parts didicerim, paucls dabo:
Oratorem voluit esse me, non Prologum:
Vestrum judicium fecit; me actorem dedit.
Sed hic actor tantum poterit a facundia,
Quantum ille poterit cogitare commode,
Qui orationem hanc scripsit, quam dicturus sum.
Nam quod rumores distulerunt malevoli,
Multas contaminasse Graecas, dum facit
Paucas Latinas; id esse factum hic non negat,
Neque se id pigere, and deinde facturum autumat.
Habet bonorum exemplum, quo exemplo sibi
Licere id facere, quod illi fecerunt, putat.
Tum quod malevolus vetus Poeta dictitat,
Repent ad studium hunc se applicasse musicum,
Amicum ingenio fretum, hand natura sua:
Arbitrium vestrum, vestra ex^stimatio
Valebit. Quare omnes vos oratos volo,
Ne plus iniquum possit, quam aeqrum oration.
Facite, aequi sitis. Date crescendi copiam
Novarum, qui spectandi faciunt copiam
Sine vitiis. Ne ille pro se dictum existumet,
Qui nuper fecit servo current is in via
Decesse populum, cur insano serviat?
De illius peccatis plura dicet, cum dabit
Alias novas, nisi finem maledictis facit.
Adeste aequ^ animo: date potestatem mihi,
Statariam agere ut liceat per silentium;
Ne semper servus currens, iratus senex,
Edax parasitus, sycophanta autem impudens,
Avarus leno, assidue agendl sint seni
Clamore summo, cum labor maxumo.
Mea causa causam hanc justam esse animum inducite,
Ut aliqua pars laboris minuatur mihi:
Nam nunc novas qui scribunt, nil parcunt seni:
Si qua laboriosa est, ad me curritur:
Sin levis est, ad alium mox defertur gregem.
In hac est pura oration; experimini,
In utramque partem ingenium quid possit meum.
Si nunqnam avare pretium statur arti meae,
Et cum esse quaestum in animum induxi maxumum,
Quam maxume servire vestris commodis,
Exemplum statuite in me, ut adolescentuli
Vobis placere studeant potius quam sibi.
Act. I. Scene 1.
Chremes, Menedemus. Chapter ALthough this acquaintance betwixt us is of very late
time,
And hereupon in that you have bought a piece of ground here hard by,
Neither was there indeed almost any matter of occasion, besides;
Yet either your honesty, or your neighborhood,

Causes me boldly and familiarly to advise you,
Because you seem to do otherwise then becomes one of your age,
And otherwise then your estate does advise you to;
For, O wonderful strange! what mean you to do with your self,

Or more then so, as I suppose; no man hoth a better piece of ground
In these parts, nor more worth;
You have a great many servants; and yet as though you had no body,
You your self so diligently supply their office.

So late in an evening, but I epsy you in your ground,
Either digging or plowing, or carrying something. To be short,
You slack no time, nor do you consider your self.
I know very well, that these things are no pleasure to you.

What pains of your own you bestow in working,
If you would spend it in employing them, you would do more good.

Men. Chremes, have you so much leisure srom your own business,
That you can mind other men's, those which do not belong to you?

Chapter
Imagine I do but admonish you, or ask you a question:
It is lawful that I should do it; it is not to discourage you.

M. I have need to do thus: Do you do as is needful for you to do.

Chapter Is it needful for any man to torment himself?

M. For me it is.

Chapter
I pray you? what have you deserved so much of your self?

M. Alas.

Chapter Do not weep, but let me know the matter what ever it is.
Do not keep it in, be not afraid; believe me, I say,
I will help you either by comforting you, or advising, or in the thing it self.

M.

Chapter For this reason indeed that I told you.

M. I will tell you.

Chapter But in the mean time lay down
Those boughs, do not work.

M. By no means.

Chapter What do you do?

M. Let me alone; that I may not afford my self any time
Free from labor.

Chapter I say, I will not let you alone.

M. Ah, you do not do fairly.

Chapter

M. Such is my desert.

Chapter Now speak.

M. I have one only son, a young youth;
But what said I, that I have one? Nay, Chremes I had one,
But whether I have one now or not, I am uncertain.

Chapter Why so?

M. You shall know.
There is here a poor old woman a stranger from Corinth,

So as he was just near upon having her to wife. All these things were done
unknown to me.
When I came to know it, I began to deal with him
Not in a gentle way, nor as it became the weak mind of a youth,
But by force, and after the common fashion of fathers:

Any longer, whilst I your father am alive,
So as to have a sweetheart now as though she were your wife?
You are mistaken, if you think so, and you do not know me, Clinia.
I am contented you should be called my son so long

I shall find what may be fitting for me to do to you.
That comes of nothing else but too much idleness;
When I was at that age I did not set my mind on wooing
But I went hence into Asia, by reason of poverty, and there

At last the matter came just to this pass; the young youth
Was overcome with hearing the same things often over, and with gries.
He thought that I by reason of my age and good will toward him
Knew more, and would provide better for him, then he could do for himself;
Chremes, into Asia to the King to be a soldier

Chapter What soy you?

M. He went unknown to me, and has been away this three months.

Chapter Ye are both too blame; though that enterprise for all this
Is a sign of a bashful mind, and of one that is no coward.

M. When I understood it by those that were privy to it,

I not knowing what to do for grief, I sat me down:
My servants come running to me, they pull off my shoes;
I see others hasten to lay the table,
And to get ready my supper: every one for his own part did the best he could,

When I saw these things, I began to muse with my self; Alas, are so many
So much trou^led sor my sake only, that they may give me content?
Should so many maids cloth me? Should I alone
Be at so great charges in my house? but my only son

Because that age is more meet to make use of these things,
I have abandoned him hence poor man by my unjust dealing.
Truly I may judge my self worthy of any misery,
If I should do it; for so long as he shall live that poor kind of life,

I will punish my self all the while for his sake,
Working, pinching, seeking sor more, and making my self a slave to him,
And so I do: I leave nothing at all in my house.
Neither vessel, nor suit, I scraped all together.

All except those who by doing husbandry-work
Could easily gain their charges; I set a b^ll presently
Upon my house to be sold; I got together about two thousand pounds.
I bought this parcel of ground, and here I ^mpl^y my self.
Chremes, that I do less wrong to my son,
So long as I undergo mis^rie my self;
And that it is not lawful for me to enjoy any pleasure here,
Till he that should share with me return safe.

Chapter I think that you are tenderhearted toward your children;

Well or orderly. But you neither knew him well enough,
Nor he you, this falls out there, where men do not live as they ought.
You never let him see how much you valued him,
Neither durst he commit such things to you, as it is fit for a father to know;


M. It is so, I confess; I am in the greatest fault of the two.

Chapter But Menedemus, I hope it will be well for all this, and I trust, that he
Is well, and will be here shortly with you.

M. God grant it may be so.

Chapter He will grant it; and now if it may be convenient,
Bacchus to day, I would have you be at my house.

M. I cannot.

Chapter Why not? I pray you, spare your self
A little; your son that is away would have you do so.

M. There is no reason that I who have forced him to pain,
Should now avoid it my self.

Chapter Is that your resolution?

M.

Chapter Fare you well.

M. And you too.

Chapter He has made me to weep,
And I pity him. But as the time of the day is,
I must put this Phania in mind to come to supper:
I will go see if he be at home. He needed no body
To put him in mind; They say he has been ready a good while

I will go hence in a doors: But why did the door creak?
Who come's hence out ot my house? I will step aside hither.

Act. I. Scen. 1.
Chremes, Menedemus. Chapter QUanquam haec inter nos nupera notitia admodum est,
Inde adeo quod agrum in proximo hic mercatus es,
Nec rei fere sane amplius quicquam fuit:
Tamen vel virtus tua me, vel vicinitas,

Facit ut te audacter moneam, and familariter,
Quod videre praeter aetatem tuam
Facere, and praeterquam res te adhortatur tua^
Nam proh Deum atque hominum fidem! qui^ is tibi?

Aut plus eo, ut conjicio; agrum in his regionibus
Mellorem, neque pretii majoris nemo habet;
Servos quam plures: P^oinde quasi nemo siet,
Ita tute attente illorum officia fungere.

Domum revertor, quin te in fundo conspicer
Fodere, aut arare, aut aliquid far. Denique,
Nullum remittis tempus, neque te respicis.
Haec non voluptati tibi esse, satis certe scio.

Quod in opere faciundo operae consumis tuae,
Si sumas in illis exercendis, plus agas.

Men. Chreme, tantumne est ab re tua otii tibi,
Aliena ut cures, ea quae nihil ad te attinent?

Chapter
Vel me monere hoc, vel percunctari puta;
Rectum est ut ego faciam; non est ut deterream.

Men. Mihi sic est usus. Tibi ut opus est facto, face.

Chapter An cuiquam homini est usus, ut se cruciet?

M. Mihi.

Chapter
Quaeso? quid de te tantum meruisti?

M. Eheu.

Chapter Ne lachryma, atque istuc quicquid est, fac me ut sciam.
Ne retice; ne verere: creed, inquam, mihi,
Aut consolando, aut consilio, aut re juvero.

Scire hoc vis?

Chapter Hac quidem causa qua dixi tibi.

M. Dicetur.

Chapter At istos rastros interea tamen
Depone, ne labora.

M, Minime.

Chapter Quam rem agis?

M. Sine; vacuum tempus ne quid them mihi
Laboris.

Chapter Non sinam, inquam.

M. Ah, non aequum facis.

Chapter

M. Sic meritum est meum.

Chapter Nunc loquere.

M. Filium unicum adolescentulum
Habeo; at, quid dixi, habere me? imo habui, Chreme,
Nunc habeam necne incertum est.

Chapter Quid ita istuc?

M. Scies.
Est e Corintho hic advena anus paupercula,

Prope jam ut pro uxore haberet. Haec clam me omnia.
Ubi id rescivi, coepi non humanitus,
Neque ut animum decuit aegrotum adolescentuli
Tractare; sed vi and via provulgata patrum;

Licere speras facere, me vivo patre
Amicam ut habeas prope jam in uxorisloco?
Erras, si id credis, and me ignoras, Clinia.
Ego te meum esse dici tantisper volo,

Ego, quod me in te sit facere dignum, invenero.
Nulla ad o ex re ist^c fit, nisi ex nimio otio.
Ego istuc aetatis non amori operam dabam,
Sed in Asiam hinc abii propter pauperiem, atque ibi

Postremo adeo res rediit; adolescentulus
Saepe eadem and graviter audiendo victus est.
Putavit me and aetate and benevolent a
Plus scire, and providere quam seipsum sibi.


Chapter Quid ais?

M. Clam me profectus menses ^res abest.

Chapter Ambo accusandi: etsi illud incoeptum tamen,
Animi est pudentis signum and non instrenui.

M. Ubi comperi ex his qui fue^e ei conscii,

Conturbato atque incerto prae a gritud ne, assedi:
Accurrunt servi; soccos detrahunt:
Video alios festinare, lectos sternere,
Coenam apparare; pro se quisque sedulo

Ubi video, haec coepi cogitare; Hem, tot mea
Solius solliciti sunt causa, ut me unum expleant?
Ancillae tot me vestiant? sumptus domi
Tantos ego solus faciam? sed gnatum unicum

Quod illa aetas magis ad haec utenda idonea est,
Eum ego hinc ejeci miscrum injust tia mea.
Malo equidem me dignum quovis deputem,
Si id fa^iam; nam usque dum ille vitam illam incolet

Interea usque illi de me supplicium dabo,
Laborans, parcens, quaerens, illi serviens.
Ita facio: prorsus nihil relinquo in aed bus,
Nec vas, nec vesti mentum: contasi omnia.

Faciundo facile sumptum exercerert suum,
Omnes perduxi ac vendidi: inscripsi illico
Aedes mercede; quasi ad talenta quindecim
Coegi: agrum hunc mercatus sum, hic me exerceo.

Chreme meo gnato facere, dum fiam miser.
Nefas esse ulla me voluptate hic f^ui,
Nisi ubi ille huc salvus redierit meus particeps.

Chapter Ingenio te esse in liberos leni puto.

Tractaret. Verum neque tu illum satis noveras,
Nec te ille: hoc ibi fit, ubi vere non vivitur.
Tu illum, nunquam ostendistl, quanti penderes;
Nec tibi ille credere est ausus, quae est aequum patri;


M. Ita res est fateor; peccatum a me maxumum est.

Chapter Menedeme, at porro recte spero, and illum tibi
Salvum, and futurum esse hic confido propediem.

M. Utinam ita Dii faxint.

Chapter Facient; nunc si est commodum,


M. Non possum.

Chapter Cur non? quaeso tandem aliqnantulum Tibi parce: Idem absens facere te hoc
vult filius.

M. Non convenit, qui illum ad laborem impulerim,
Nunc me ipsum fugere.

Chapter Siccine est sententia?

M.

Chapter Been vale.

M. Et tu.

Chapter Lachrymas excussit mihi.
Miseretque me ejus. Sed ut diei tempus est,
Monere oportet me hunc ad coenam Phaniam
Ut veniat; ibo ut visam si domi est. Nihil opus
Fuit monitore, praesto jamdudum domi

Ibo hinc intro. Sed quid crepuerunt fores?
Hinc a me quisnam egreditur? huc concessero.

Act I. Scen. 2.
Clitopho, Chremes. Cl. THere is no cause yet, Clinia, why you should be
afraid; verily they do not linger.
And I know that she will be here for you to day, together with the messenger.
And therefore let go that false thought somness, which so tormenteth you.

Chapter Who is my son talking withal?

Cl. My father is here, whom I wished for. Father, you come in good time.

Chapter

Cl. Do you know Menedemus ^his neighbor of ours?

Chapter Very well.

Cl. Do you know that he has a son?

Chapter I heard he is in Asia.

Cl. He is not father; he is at our house.

Chapter What say you?

Cl. I brought him to supper, as soon as he came, just as he came from the ship;
For he and I had been acquainted over since we were little children.

Chapter You tell me good news. How I could wish that our neighbor Menedemus

At my house; and now it is full time.

Cl. Father, take heed how you do it; there is no need.

Chapter Why so?

Cl. Because as yet he is uncertain what to do with himself: He is but newly
come.
He is afraid of every thing; his fathers displeasure, and how his sweetheart
is affected to him.
He l^v th her dearly; this ado, and this going away is all long of her.

Chapter I know that.

Cl. Sy us with him.

Chapter What says he?

Cl. What? he says that he is in a miserable case.

Ch M^serable! whom
Should one think to be less miserable? What wants he, but he has those things
Which are rcckoned for good in a man, parents, a safe country, friends, stock,
kindred,
Riches; and these are indeed just as his mind is that enjoys them.


Chapter Nay, but
That old man has been always very unreasonable, and now I fear nothing more,
but
That his father b^ing angry will do more then is fitting against him.

Chapter What he? But
I will refrain my self; for it is good for this my son, that he stand in fear.

Cl. What say you with your self?

Chapter I will tell you.
How ever the case stood, yet he should have tarried; perhaps his father was a
little more harsh

If he will not abide his own father? was it fitting that the father should
live as the son would have him,
Or the Son as the Father would have him? and whereas he pretends he is harsh;
it is not so:
For Parents injuries are for the most part of one sort; he that is a man but
pretty tolerable,
They are loath they should often play the whore-master, they are loath they
should often feast it;

But when once the mind has entangled it self with a naughty appetite,
It must needs be, Clitipho, that like resolutions do follow. This is
A known truth, to make trial by others, what may be useful for your self.

Clit. I think so.

Chapter I will go hence in adoors, that I may see what supper we have.


Actus I. Scen. 2.
Clitipho, Chremes. Cl. NIhil est adhuc quod vereare, Clinia; haudquaquam etiam
cessant:
Et illam simul cum nuncio tibi hic ego ad futuram hodie, scio.
Proin tu sollicitudinem istam falsam, quae te excruciat, mittas.

Chapter Quicum loquitur filius?

Cl. Pater adest, quem volui. Pater, opportune advenis.

Chapter

Cl. Hunc Menedemum nostin' vicinum nostrum?

Chapter Probe.

Cl. Huic filium scis esse?

Chr. Audivi esse in Asia.

Chapter Non est, pater a pud nos est.

Chapter Quid ais?

Cl. Advenientem, e navi egre-dientem illico abduxi
Ad coenam, nam mihi cum eo jam inde usque a pueritia semper fuit familiaritas.

Chapter Voluptatem magnam nuntias. Quam vellem Menedemum vicinum

Objicerem ^ei, domi! atque etiam nunc tempus est.

Cl. Cave faxis, non est opus, pater.

Chapter Qua propter?

Cl. Quia enim incertum est etiam quid se faciat: modo venit.
Timet omnia, pat: is iram, atque animum amicae se erga ut sit suae.
Eam misere amat, propter eam haec turba atque abitio evenit.

Chapter Scio.

Cl.

Chapter Quid narrat?

Cl. Quid? ille miserum se esse.

Chapter Miserum! quem minus
Credere est? Quid reliqui est, quin habeat, quae quidem esse in homine d^cuntur
Bona, parents, patriam incolumem, amicos, genus, cognatos,
D^vitias? Atque haec perinde sunt ut illius any qui ea possider: 20. Qui uti
scit, ei bona; illi qui non utitur recte, mala.

Cl. Immo ille fuit
Senex import^nus semper: and nunc nihil magis. Vereor quam ne quid
In illum iratus plus satis faxit pater.

Chapter Illene? Sed reprimam me,
Nam in metu esse hunc, illi est utile.

Cl. Quid tute to cum?

Chapter Dicam.
U^ ut erat, mansum tamen oportu^t: fortasse aliquanto iniquior

Non ferret suum? hunccine erat aequum ex illius more, an illum
Ex hujus vivere? Et quod illum insimulat durum, id non est: nam parentum
Injuriae uniusmodi sunt ferme, paulo qui est homo tolerabilis,
Scortari crebro nolunt, crebro convivarier nolunt,

Verum ubi animus semel se cupiditate se devinxit mala,
Necesse est, Clitipho, consilia copsequi similia. Hoc
Scitum est, periculum ex aliis facere, tibi quod ex usu siet.

Cl. Ita credo.

Chapter Ego ibo hinc intro, ut videam nobis quid coenae siet.


Act II. Scene 1.
Clitipho. Cl. WHat unequal judges are fathers toward all young men?
Who think it meet that we should presently of children become old-men,
And not be partakers of those things which youth affords?
They measure us according to their desire which they have now, and not which
they had in times past.

For a time shall be allowed both to know, and pardon his faults.
I will not do as my Father, who shows me his mind by another person;
I am undone: When he has drunk a little too much, what pranks of his does he
tell!
Now he says, Make trial by others, what may be good for your self.

My sweet-hearts sayings do now more move me, Give me, and fetch me;
To whom I have nothing that I can answer, nor is any one in a worse condition:
For this Clinia, although he have work enough of his own to do, yet
He has one that is will and modestly brought up, and that knows not how to
play the whore.

Moreover, all that I have to give her, is to say well; for I dare not say I
have nothing.
I found this mischief not long ago, and my father does not yet know it.

Actus II. Scen. 1.
Clitipho. Cl. Quam iniqui sunt patres in omnes adolescentes judices?
Qui aequum esse censent jam nos a pueris illico nasci senes,
Neque illarum affines esse rerum quas fert adolescenti^:
Ex sua libidine moderantur nunc quae est, non quae olim fuit.

Nam and cognoscendi and ignoscendi dabitur peccatis locus:
Non ut meus, qui mihi per alium ostendit suam sententiam:
Perii: is ubi adbibit plus paulo, sua quae narrat facinora!
Nunc ait, Periculum ex aliis facito tibi quod ex usu siet.

Magis nunc me amicae dicta stimulant, Da mihi atque affer mihi:
Cui quid respondeam nihil habeo, neque quisquam est miserior.
Nam hic Clinia etsi is quoque suarum rerum satagit, attamen
Habet been and pudice eductam, ignaram artis meretrie^ae.

Tum quod them ei recte est: nam nihil esse mihi religi^ est d^cere.
Hoc ego mali non pr^dem inven^, neque etiam dum scit pater.

Act II. Scene 2.
Clinia, Clitipho. Cl. IF all things went well with me concerning my love, I
know
They would have come long ago; but I fear least the woman be corrupted here,
whilst I was away;
Many thoughts come in my head, which may increase my suspicion:
The occasion, the place, her age, her bad Mother under whose command she is,
to whom


Clit. Clinia.

Clin. Woe is me poor man.

Clit. Yet take heed that no body coming from your fathers chance to espy you
here.

Clin. I will. But I do not know what evil my mind for gives me.

Clit. Do you go on to judge of that, before you know what truth there is in it?

Clin. If there were no harm, they would have been here already.

Clit. They will be here by and by.

Clin. When will that be?

Clit.
Whilst they are getting up, and getting ready, it is a years time.

Clin. O Clitipho,
I am afraid.

Clit. Take heart again; see where Dromo is and Syrus; they are both here
together for you.

Actus II. Scen. 2.
Clinia, Clitipho. Clin. SIm hi secundae res essent de amore meo, jan dudum scio
Venissent: sed vercor, ne mulier, me abscntc, hic corrupta sit:

Occasio, lo^^s, aetas, matter cujus sub imperio est mala, cui nihil


Clit. Clinia.

Clin. Hei mise^o mihi,

Clit. Etiam cave, ne videat forte hic te a patre aliquis ex^ens.

Clin. Faciam, sed nescio quid prof^cto animus praesagit mali.

Clit. Pergin' ^stuc prius d^judicare, quam scias quad very siet.

Clin. Si nihil mali esset, jam hic adessent.

Clit. Jam aderunt

Clin. Quando is it c^erit?

Clit.
Dum moliuntur, dum comuntur, annus est.

Clin. O Clitipho,
Timeo.

Clit. Respira, eccum Dromonem cum Syro! una adsun tibi.

Act II. Scene 3.
Syrus, Dromo, Clitipho, Clinia. S. SAy you so?

D. It is so.

S. But in the mean time whilst we hold discourse,
They are left behind.

Clit. Your woman is here for you; do you hear, Clinia?

Clin. I hear indeed now at length, and see her, and am very well, Clitipho.

S. It is no wonder they are so hindered; they bring a company


Clin. I am undone: whence had she those maids?

Clit. Do you ask me?

S. They should not have been left, they bring some things with them.

Clin. We is me.

S. Gold, and clothes; and it groweeh toward night, and they know not the way.
We have done foolishly. Do you, Dromo, step and meet them.
Make haste, why do you loyter?

Clin. We is me poor man, how am I fallen short of my hope?

Clit.

Clin. Do you ask what it is?
Do not you see her maids, her gold, her clothes, whom I left here but with one
maid!
Whence do you think they are?

Clit. Ah, now at length I understand you.

S. O strange, what a hurry is here! I know our house will scarce he be able to
hold them.
What shall they eat? what shall they drink? what will be more miserable then
our old man?


Clin. O. Jupiter! where is there any truth to be found?
While I wandering up and down like a madman, want my Country sor your sake,
you in the mean time
Have enriched your self, Antiphila, and for saken me in these misfortunes,
Because of whom I undergo very great disgrace, and am not so dutitifull to my
father as I ought to be:
For whose sake I am ashamed, and I pity him, that often told me the conditions
of these whores.

Which thing I will now do; I would not do it then when it might have been for
my good.
There is no man in a worse case than I.

S. He is mistaken surely upon our words,
Wh^en we shake here. Clinia, you take your sweetheart to be otherwise then
she is,
For her course of life is the same, and her mind is the same as it was toward
you,


Clin. What is the matter, I beseech you? f^r there is nothing that I would now
be more glad of,
Than that I make a false surmiz^ about this matter.

S. First and fore^ost, that you may not be ignorant os any thing touching this
matter,
The old-woman which was heretofore said to be her mother, was not so.


Clit. Who is that other woman?

S. Tarry, Clitipho, I will first tell out my tale which I have begun,
And afterward I will come to that.

Clit. Make haste.

S. Now first of all,
As soon as ever we came at the house. D^ knocked at the door;

She presently got her self here in again; I followed hard after her:
The old-woman bolted the door, and fell to her spinning again.
Hereupon, or no way else, Clinia, it may be known,
In what employment she spent her time, when you was away,

For that thing then gave us an occasion to judge
Of the daily course of her life,
Which does most of all declare every ones disposition how it is.
We found her busily weaving a web,

For that old woman's sake, I suppose, which was dead;
Dressed then without any gold, just as they that are dressed for themselves:
We found her not painted with any ugly matter,
He hair was loose, hanging down, and thrown back


Clin. I pray thee, good Syrus,
Do not bring me into a fools Paradise.

S. The old-woman
Spun the woof, and a little maid besides,
She weaved with her, being all ragged,
Not regarded, nasty with sl^ttish less.

Clit. If these things be true Clinia,
As I believe they are, who is more fortunate then you?
Do you know this fluttish and nastie girl that he speaks of?
This also is a great sign that the mistress is faultless,
When they that go her errands to and fro are so much neglected.
For the order is, that they that desire way to the mistresses,


Clin. Go on I pray you, and beware you do not labor
To get thanks of me undeserved. What said she, when you named me?

Sir. As soon as we told her that you were returned, and entreated her
To come to you, the woman left her web presently,

That you might easily perceive it was done for the love of you.

Clin. I know not, I swear, where I am for joy;
I was so afraid.

Clit. But I knew there was no cause, Clinia:
Come on again, Syrus, tell me who is that other woman?

Sy. Bacchis with us.

Cl. How now? what, Bacchis?
Why you rogue, whither do you bring her?

Sir. Whither do I bring her? to our house for sooth.

Clit. To my father?

Sir. To him himself.

Clit. O the shameless boldness
Of the fellow!

Sir. Do you hear Sir, a great and memorable exploit
Is not done without danger.

Clit. Look you to this; you rogue, you go about

Though never so little fail you, I am undone; what will you do with him?

Sir. But.

Clit. What but?

Sir. If you will let me alone, I will tell you.

Clin. Let him alone.

Clit. I do let him alone.

Sir. Thus stands the matter; she as though with.

Clit. What
Long tales, with a mischief, does he begin to tell me?

Clin. He speaks the truth:


Sir. Truly I cannot but speak it,
Clitipho is injurious to me many ways, and he cannot be born withal.

Clin. Truly you must hear; hold your peace.

Clit. What is the matter?

Sir. You desire to love,
You desire to obtain, you desire it may be brought about, that you may have
something to give her, you will not willingly be at any hazard
In enjoying her; you are very wise, if this be to be wise, for you to desire
that

Or those that are to be foregone with these: Now see whether of these two
proffers
You would rather have; although I know this resolution that I have taken
Is right and safe. For there is liberty for your sweet heart to be with you
At your fathers, without any fear; and then as for the money which you
promised her,

Already by entreating me: What else would you have?

Clit. If indeed
This be done.

Sir. If indeed: you shall know it by making trial.

Clit. Well, well, tell me,
That your resolution, what it is.

Sir. We will fain his sweetheart to be
Your sweetheart.

Cl. Finely done! tell me what shall he do


Sir. Nay, she shall be had to your mother.

Clit. Why thither?

Sir. Clitipho,
It would be too long for me to tell you why I do it: there is cause sufficient.

Clit. These are but tales. I see nothing substantial why it is meet for me
To take this sear upon my self.

Sir. Stay, I have another trick, if you fear this,


Clit. I pray you,
Find some such thing as this.

Sir. Yes, I will go hence to meet them,
And bid them return home again.

Clit. Ha, what said you?

Sir. I will rid you
Of all your fear by and by, that you may rest securely.

Clit. What should I do now?

Clin. What you? What becomes an honest man.

Clit. Syrus, Do but tell me the truth.

Sir.

Clin. She is offered you now, enjoy her whilst you may;
For you know not whether you may have liberty of her hereafter, or never.

Clit. Syrus, I say.

Sir. Go on and spare not; yet I will do it.

Clit. Indeed that is very true, you said,
Syrus; Syrus I say, ho, ho Syrus.

Sir. He is very hot, what would you have?

Clit. come again, come again.

Sir. Here I am, say what is the matter; You will say anon that this does not
like you.

Clit. Syrus, I commit my self, my love, and my credit to you,
You are the judge, see you be not blameworthy.

Sir. It is a fondness,
Clitipho, for you to warn me of this. As if I was not as much concerned in the
matter,
As you; If any miscarriage chance to happen to us in this matter,
You shall be chid, but this fellow shall be beaten. Wherefore,

That he would make as though she were his sweet heart.

Clin. Yes, For the matter is now come to that point
That I must needs do it.

Clit. I love you, and good reason why, Clinia.

Clit. But take heed she do not faulter in her speech.

Sir. She is taught her lesson very well.
But I wonder at this, how you could so easily persuade her,


Sir. I came to her in season which is the chiefest thing of all.
For there I found a wretched soldier, entreating a nights lodging with her.
She dealt cunningly with the fellow, that she might inflame his lustful mind
With the want of her, and that she might be very great in your favor because
of this.
But do you hear Sir, have a care that you do not fall on unawares.

How little command you use to have of your self; forbear your speaking the
wrong word first,
Your turning your neck aside, your sighing, your spitting,, your coughing, and
laughing.

Clit. You will commend my behavior.

Sir. Have a care.

Clit. You your self will wonder at me.

Sir. But how soon have the women overtaken us?

Clit. Where are they? Why do you hold me?

Sir. Now this is none of your sweetheart.

Clit. I know that, at my fathers.


Sir. Not a jot the mere.

Clit. Let (...) alone.

Sir. I will not let you alone, I say.

Clit. I pray you, a little while.

Sir. I forbid you.

Clit. At least wise let me salute her.

Sir. Get you gone
If you be wise.

Clit. I am going, but what must be do?

Sir. He shall tarry.

Clit. O happy man he!

Sir. Walk.

Act. II. Scen. 3.
Syrus, Dromo, Clitipho, Clinia. S. AIn' tu?

D. Sic est.

S. Verum interea dum sermones edi^ mus,
Illae sunt relictae.

Clit. Mulier tibi adest, audin' Cliniae?

Clin. Ego vero audio nunc demum, and video and valeo, Clitipho.

Sir. Minime mirum, adeo impeditae sunt; ancillarum gregem


Clin. Perii, unde illique sunt ancillae?

Cl. Me rogas?

Sir. Non oportuit relictas: portant* quid rerum.

Clin. Hci mihi.

Sir. Aurum, vestem, and vesp^rascit, and non noverunt viam.
Factum a nobis stulte est. Abi dum tu, Dromo, illis obviam.
Propera, quid stas?

Clin. Vae misero mihi, quanta de spe decidi!

Clit.

Clin. Rogitas quid siet?
Viden'tu ancillas, aurum, vestem, quam ego cum una ancillula
Hic reliqui; unde esse censes?

Clit. Vah, nunc demum intelligo.

Sir. Dii boni, quid turbae est? aedes nostrae vix capient scio.
Quid comedent? quid b^bent? quid seen erit n^stro miferius?


Clin. O Jupiter, ubinam est fides?
Dum ego propter te errans patria careo demens, tu interea loci,
Collocupletasti, Antiphila, te, and me in his deseruisti malis:
Propter quam in summa infamia sum, and meo patri miru, obsequens:
Cujus nunc pudet me and miseret, qui harum mores cantabat mihi,

Quod tamen nunc faciam; tum cum mihi gratum effe potuit, nolui.
Nemo est miscrior me.

Sir. Hic de nostris verbis errat videlicer,
Quae hic sumus loquuti. Clinia, Aliter ^m amorem atque est a^cipis.
Nam and vita est cadem, and animus erga te idem ac fuit,


Clin. Quid est, obsecro? nam mihi nunc nihil rerum omnium est,
Quod malim, quam me hic falso suspicarier.

S. Hoc primum, ut ne quid hujus rei ignores, anus
Quae est dicta matter ei antehac, non fuit.

Dum narrat, forte audivi.

Clit. Quaenam est altera?

S. Mane, hoc quod cepi primum enarrem, Clitipho;
Post istuc veniam.

Clit. Propera.

S. Jam primum omnium,
Ubi ventum ad aedes est, Dromo pultat fores:

Continuo hic se conjecit int^o, ego consequor.
Anus foribus obdit pessulum, ad lanam red^it;
Hic sciri potuit, aut nusquam alibi, Clinia,
Quo st^dio vitam suam te absente exegerit,

Nam ea res dedit tum existumand* copiam
Quotidianae vitae consuetudinem,
Quae cujusque ingenium ut sit declarat maxume.
Texent^m telam st^diose ipsam effendimus,

Ejus an us causa, opinor, quae erat mortus;
Sine auro tum ornatam, ita ut quae ornantur sibi;
N^lla mala re esse expolitam muliebri,
Capillus passus, prolixus, circum capur


Clin. Sire mi, obsecro
Ne me in laetitiam frustra conjicias.

S. Anus
Sub regmen nebat; praeterea una ancillula
Erat, ea texebat una pannis obsita,
Neglecta, immunda illuvie.

Clit. Si haec sunt, Clinia,
Vera, ita ut credo, quis te est fortunatior?
Scin' tu hanc quam dicit sordidatam and sordidam?
Magnum hoc quoque signum est dominam esse extra noxiam,
Cum tam negliguntur ejus inter nuncii:
Nam disciplina est, iisdem munerarier


Clin. Perge, obsecro te, and cave ne falsam gratiam
Studeas inire: quid ait ubi me nominas?

Sir. Ubi dicimus rediisse te, and rogare uti
Veniret ad te, mulier telam deserit

Ut facil e scires desiderio id fieri tuo.

Clin. Prae gaudio, ita me Dii ament, ubi sim, nescio:
Ita timui.

Clit. At ego nihil esse sciebam, Clinia,
Agedum vicissim, Sire. Dic quae est altera.

Sir.

Clit. Hem! quid? Bacchidem?
Eho, sceleste, quo illam dueis?

Sir. Quo illam ego? ad nos scilicet.

Clit. Ad patremne?

Sir. Ad eum ipsum.

Clit. O hominis impudentem
Audaciam!

Sir. Heus tu, non fit sine periclo magnum facinus
Et memorabile.

Clit. Hoc vide; in mea vita tu tibi

Quid te fugerit, ego perierim. Quid illo facias?

Sir. At enim.

Clit. Quid enim?

Sir. Si finas, dicam.

Clin. Sino.

Clit. Sino.

Sir. Ita res est, haec quasi cum.

Clit. Quas malum,
Ambages mihi narrare occipit!

Clin. Verum hic dicit,


Sir. Enimvero reticere nequeo,
Multis modis injurius Clitipho est, neque ferri potis est.

Clin. Audiendum hercle est; tace.

Clit. Quid est?

Sir. Vis amare;
Vis potiri: vis, quod des illi, effici, Tuum esse in potiundo periculum
Non vis; haud stulte sapis, siquidem id sapere est, relle te id

Aut illa cum his amittenda sunt. Harum duarum conditionum
Nunc utram malis, vide; etsi hoc consilium quod coepi rectum esse
Et tutum scio; nam apud patrem tua amica tecum
Sine metu ut sit, copia est; tum quod illi argentum es pollicitus,

Jam aures reddideras mihi. Quid aliud vis tibi?

Clit. Siquidem
Hoc fic.

Sir. Siquidem, experiundo scies.

Clit. Age, age, cedo
Istud tuum consilium, quid id est?

Sir. Adsimulabimus tuam
Amicam hujus esse amicam.

Clit. Pulchre, cedo quid hic faciet


Sir. Immo, ad tuam matrem deducetur.

Clit. Quid eo?

Sir. Longum est,
Clitipho, si tibi narrem, quamobrem id faciam: Vera causa est.

Clit. Fabulae. Nihil satis firn^i video quamobrem accipere hunc mihi Expediat
metum.

Sir. Mane, habeo illud, si istuc metuis,


Clit. Hujusmodi,
Obsecre, aliquid reperi.

Sir. Maxim ibo obviam hinc;
Dicam, ut revertantur domum.

Clit. Hem, quid dixti?

Sir. Ademptum
Tibi jam faxo omnem metum, in aurem utramvis otiose ut dormias.

Clit. Quid ago nunc?

Clin. Tune? quod boni est.

Clit. Sire, dic modo verum.

Sir.

Clin. Datur modo: fruere dum licet.
Nam nescias ejus sit potestas posth^c an nunquam tibi.

Cli,. Sire, i^quam.

Sir. Perge porro: tamen istuc ago.

Clit. Verum herele istuc est.
Sire, Sire, inquam; Heus, heus, Sire.

Sir. Concaluit: quid vis?

Clit. Redi, redi.

Sir. Adsum, dic quid est. Jam hoc quoque negabis tibi placere.

Clit.
Tu es judex, ne quid accusandus sis, vide.

Sir. Ridiculum est
Te me istuc admonere, Clitipho. Quasi istic minor mea res
Agatur quam tua. Hic si quid nobis forte adversi evenerit,
Tibi erunt parata verba, huic homini verbera. Quapropter haec res

Assimulet.

Clin. Scilicet, facturum me esse, in eum res jam
Rediit locum, ut sit necesse.

Clit. Merito te amo, Clinia.

Clin. Verum illa ne quid titubet.

Sir. Perdocta est probe.
At hoc demiror, qui tam facile potueris persuadere illi, quae


Sir. In tempore ad eam veni, quod rerum omnium est
Primum. Nam miserum quendam offendi ibi militem ejus noctem
Orantem. Haec art tractabat virum, ut illius animum cupidum
Inopia incenderet, eademque ut esset apud te ob hoc quam
Gratissima. Sed heus tu, vide sis ne quid imprudens ruas.

Quam esse soleas impotens. Inversa verba, and versas cervices tuas,
Gemitus, screatus, tusses, risus abstine.

Clit. Laudabis.

Sir. Vide sis.

Clit. Tutemet mirabere.

Sir. Sed quam cito sunt consequutae mulieres?

Clit. Ubi sunt? cur retines?

Sir. Jam nunc haec non est tua.

Clit. Scio apud patrem,


Sir. Nihilo magis.

Clit. Sine.

Sir. Non sinam, inquam.

Clit. Quaeso paulisper.

Sir. Veto.

Clit. Saltem salutare.

Sir. Abeas,
Si sapis.

Clit. Eo, quid istic?

Sir. Manebit.

Clit. O hominem
Foelicem!

Sir. Ambula.

Act II. Scene 4.
Bacchis, Antiphila, Clinia, Syrus. B. TRuly my Antiphila, I commend you, and
deem you Fortunate, seeing you endeavored that your conditions might be
answerable to your beauty:
And (I swear) I do not wonder, though every one desire to enjoy you,
For your talk discovered to me of what disposition you are, and when I consider

That you are such as you are, and that we are not. For it stands you in hand
to be honest;
They with whom we have to do, will not suffer us. For lovers being taken with
our beauty
Do haunt us; when this is decayed, they turn their minds elsewhere;
Unless we have provided somewhat for our selves in the mean time, we live
forlorn.

Very answerable to yours; these apply themselves to you; by this good turn
Ye are so really linked one to another, that never any mishap
Can befall your love.

Ant. I know not what other women are, but I know I have always done my best,
That I might do my self good by seeking his good.

Clin. Ah, then
Antiphila, you alone bring me back again into my country.
For whilst I was absent from you, I thought all the pains which I undertook
were nothing,
But only that I was without your company.

Sir. I believe you.

Clit. Syrus, I have much ado
To forbear. That I poor man may not do now as it likes my self;

Sir. Nay, for as I see your father is disposed, a long while he will deal
hardly with you.

B.

Ant. Ah, hold me, I pray you.

B. I pray you, what ail you?

Ant. I am undone poor woman.

B. Antiphila,
Why are you ready to sound.

Ant. Do I see Clinia, or no?

B. Whom do you see?

Clin. God save you my dear-heart.

Ant. O my long-looked for Clinia, God save you.

Clin. How do you?

Ant. I am glad that you are come safe home.

Clin. Antiphila, whom my heart so much desires?

Sir. Get ye in, for the old man has tarried for you a good while.

Act. II. Scen. 4.
Bacchis, Antiphila, Clinia, Syrus. B. AE Dipol te, mea Antiphila, laudo, and
fortunatam Judico: id cum studuisti formae ut mores consimiles forent,
Minimeque (ita me been Dii ament) miror, si te sibi quisque expetit,
Nam mihi quale ingenium habetes fuit indicio oration, and cum egomet

Vestrarum, vulgus quae ab se segregant; Et vos esse istiusmodi,
Et nos non esse, haud mirabile est. Nam expedit bonas esse vobis,
Nos, quibuscum res est, non sinunt. Quippe forma impulsi nostra nos
Amatores colunt: haec ubi imminuta est, illi suum animum alio
Conferunt: nisi si prospectum est interea aliquid nobis, desertae vivimus.

Est consimilis vestrum; hi se ad vos applicant; hoc beneficio utrique
Ab utrisque ve (...) devincimini, ut nunquam ulla amori vestro incidere
Possit calamitas.

Ant. Nescio alias; me quidem semper scio fecisse sedulo,
Ut ex illius commodo meum comparem commodum.

Clin. Vah, ergo

Nam dum abs te absum, omnes mihi labores fu ere, quas cepi, leves,
Praeterquam tui carendum quod erat.

Sir. Credo.

Clit. Sire, vix
Suffero. Hoccine me miserum non licere meo medo ingenio f^ui!

Sir. Imo, ut patrem tuum video esse habitum diu, etiam duras dabi^*

B.

Ant. Ah, retine me, Obsecro.

B. Amabo, quid tibi est?

Ant. Disperii misera.

B. Quid
Stupes, Antiphila?

Ant. Videon' Cliniam, an non?

B. Quem
Vides?

Clin. Salve, anime mi.

Ant. O mi expectate Clinia, Salve.

Clin. U^ vales?

Ant. Salv^m advenisse gaudeo.

Clin.

Sir. Ite intro, nam vos jamdudum expectat senex.

Act. III. Scen. 1.
Chremes, Menedemus. Chapter IT is toward day: Do I forbear to knock at this door
Of my neighbors? that he may first know from me that his son
Is returned, although I know the young man is both to have it so.
But forasmuch as I see this poor man is so much troubled

When there is no danger to him by discovering it?
I will not do it, for I will help the old man as far as I am able,
Just as I see my son to be ready to serve his friend and companion,
And to help him with his attendance in all his business;


Men. Certainly I am either notably born disposed
To misery, or that is not true which I hear to be commonly
Spoken, that Time takes away grief from men;
For my grief concerning my son increases with me daily

He is away, by so much I desire and covet more and more to see him.

Chapter But I see him gone out of doors, I will go to him, and speak to him.
Menedemus, God save you, I bring you news
Whereof you desire most especially to be a sharer.

Men. Chremes, Have you heard any thing concerning my son?

Chapter He is well, and alive.

Men. Where I pray you?

Chapter At home at my house.

Men. My son?

Chapter Yes.

Men. Is he come?

Chapter For certain.

Men. Is my son
Clinia come?

Chapter I told you so.

Men. Let us go, have me to him, I pray you:

Chapter He would not have you know that he is returned yet, and he avoideth

Lest your old wonted austerity should be increased.

Men. Did not you tell him, how I was?

Chapter No.

Men. Why so, Chremes?

Chapter Because you take a very bad course both for him and you in that matter,
son show your self to be so tenderhearted, and easily overcome.

Men.

Chapter Ah
Menedemus, You are too eager both ways,
Either in too much spending or sparing.
You shall fall into the same trap by the one as well as the other.
First, in times past rather then you would suffer your son

And by whom all things were thankfully accepted,
You rated him hence; she being forced whether she would or not
Began to seek a living where she could come by it;
Now when she cannot be had without great loss,

How well she is now fitted to work ones destruction:
First of all, she has brought with her above ten maids
Laden with clothes and gold; if her lover were a Lord,
He could never be able to maintain her charges,


Men. Is she within?

Chapter Do you ask, whether she be or not?
I have felt it: For I have bestowed one supper upon her,
And her attendants; but if I were to give them another, I should be undone;
For to let other things pass, what wine has she spent me even now
In sipping, saying thus, This wine is somewhat too harsh,

I have unbroached all my hogs-heads, all my pipes,
I had all my folks bi^sied, and this was but one night,
What do you think will become of you, whom they will daily eat out of house
and harbor?
I swear from my heart, I pity your estate,
Menedemus.

Men. Let him do as he lists.
Let him take, let him spend, let him waste, I am resolved ^^ abide it,
So I may but have him with me.

Chapter If you be resolved
So to do, I think it will be very requisite for you,
That he may think you give it him unwittingly.

Men.

Chapter Any thing rather then what you intend;
I would have you give him by any body else, and suffer your self
To be cosened by a servant with his tricks, although that I perceive that also,
That they are about it, and consult of it closely amongst themselves.
Syrus whispereth with that son of yours, and the young men lay their heads
together;

This way, then a pound the other way.
We do not now stand about money, but that is we stand about,
How we may let the young man have it with the least peril;
For if he once come to understand your mind,

Lose all your money, then you will let your son go from you,
Fie, what a gap will you lay open for his lewdness?
So as besides you have small comfort of your life;
For we are all of us worse by too much liberty,

Neither will he consider whether it be bad or good which he shall request;
You will never be able to endure your estate and him to be cast away.
You will deny to give him, he will presently run to that
Whereby he shall think himself most able to prevail with you.


Men. You seem to speak the truth, and just as the matter is.

Chapter Truly, I have not slept one wink all this night,
Whilst I was musing, how I might help you to your son again.

Men. Give me your right hand; I entreat you further Chremes that you would do
this same thing.

Chapter

Men. Do you know what I would have you do now?

Chapter Tell me.

Men. That which you perceive they go about to cosen me of.
That they would make haste to do it; I desire to give him
What he would have; I long now to see him.

Chapter I will do my best.
I must take Syrus in hand and persuade him.

Lest they should think that you and I have agreed betwixt our selves;
This little business hinders me; Sinus and Crito
Our neighbors are at a controversy here about their lands.
They have made me an Vmpire betwixt them; I will go and say, as I told you,

I will be here again presently.

Men. I pray you do so: O strange!
That the nature of all men should be so disposed,
That they can better see and judge of other men's things then their own
Comes it hereupon, because in our own affairs

Or gries of mind? How much wiser
Now is this man for me then I am for my self?

Chapter I have rid my self srom them, that I might attend you at leisure.

Chremes, Menedemus. Chapter LUcescit; hoc jam cesso pultare ostium
Vicini? primum ex me ut sciat sibi filium
Redisse; etsi adolescentem hoc nolle intelligo;
Verum cum videam miserum hunc tam cruciarier

Cum illi pericli nihil ex indicio siet?
Haud faciam: adjuvabo senem nam quod potero;
Ita ut'filium meum amico atque aequali suo
Video inservire, and servum esse in negotii^:


Men. Aut ego prefecto ingenio egregie ad miseriam
Natus sum, aut illud falsum est quod vulgo audio
Dici, Diem adimere aegritudinem hominibus:
Nam mihi quotidie augescit magis de filio

Abest, magis cupio tanto and magis defidero.

Chapter Sed ipsum egressum for as video; ib^, alloquar.
Menedeme, salve, nuncium apporto tibi
Cujus maxume te fieri participem cup^s.

Men. Meus gnatus?

Chapter Sic est.

Men. Venit?

Chapter Cert^.

Meus venit?

Chapter Dixi.

Men. Eamus; duc me ad eum, obsecro.

Chapter Non vult te scire se rediisse etiam, and tuum

Ne tua duritia illa antiqua etiam adaucta siet.

Men. Non tu ei dixisti, ut essem?

Chapter Non.

Men. Quamobrem, Chreme?

Chapter Quia pessume istuc in te atque in illum consulis,
Si te tam leni and victo esse animo ostenderis.

Men.

Chapter Ah,
Vehemens in utramque partem, Menedeme, es nimis,
Aut largitate nimia aut parsimonia;
In eandem fraudem ex hac re arque ex illa incides.
Primum olim potius quam pater ere filium

Contenta, euique erant grata omnia,
Perterruisti hinc: ea coacta ingratiis
Post illa coepit victum vulgo quaerere.
Nunc cum sine magno intertrimento non potest

Quam ea nunc instructa pulchre ad perniciem siet,
Primum jam ancillas secum adduxit plus december,
Oner^tas vest atque auro: Satrapes si siet,
Amator, nunquam sufferre ejus sumptus queat,


Men. Estne ea intus?

Chapter Sit rogas?
Sensi. Nam unam coenam ei atque ejus comitibus
Dedi; quod si iterum sit danda, actum est.
Nam ut alia omittam, pitissando modo mihi
Quod vini absumpsit? sic, Hoc, dicens, asperum,

Relevi dolia omnia, omnes serias.
Omnes sollicitos habui, atque haec una nox,
Quid te futurum esse censes, quem assidue exederit?
Sic me Dii amabunt, ut me tuarum misertum est,


Men. Faciat, quod lubet,
Sumat, consumat, perdat; decretum est pati,
Dum illum modo habeam m^cum.

Chapter Si certum est tibi
Sic facere, illud permagnl refer arbitror,
Ut nescientem sentiat te id sibi dare.

Men.

Chapter Quidvis potius quam quod cogitas.
Per alium quemvis ut des; falli te sinas
Technis per servulum, ersi subsensi id quoque,
Illos ibi esse, id agere inter se clanculum.
Sy rus cum illo vestro consusurrat; conferunt

Talentum hoc pacto satius est, quam illo minam.
Non nunc de pecunia agitur, sed illud, quo modo
Minimo periculo id demus adolescentulo.
Nam si semel tuum animum ille intellexrit,

Pecuniam omnem, quam abs te amittas filium,
Hui quantam fenestram ad nequitiam parefeceris!
Tibi autem porro ut non sit suave vivere;
Nam deteriores omnes sumus licentia.

Neque id putabit pravum an rectum sit, quod petet.
Tu rem perire and illum, non poteris pati.
Dare denegaris, ibit ad illud illico,
Quo maxim apud re se valere sentiet;


Men. Videre verum, atque ita uti res est, dicere.

Chapter Somnum hercle ego hac nocte oculis non vidi meis,
Dum id quaero, tibi qui filium restituerim.

Men. Cedo dextram; porro te oro idem ut facias, Chreme.

Men. Scin', quid nunc facere te volo?

Chapter Dic.

Men. Quod sensisti illos me incipere fallere,
Id ut maturent facere; cupio illi dare,
Quod vult: cupio ipsum jam videre.

Chapter Operam dabe.
Syrus est prehendendus, atque adhortandus mihi.

Ne nos inter nos congruere sentiant.
Paulum hoc negoti mihi obstat: Sinus, and Crito
Vicini nostri hic ambigunt de finibus.
Me cepere arbitrum; ibo ac dicam, ut dixeram,

Continuo hic adero.

Men. Ita quaeso. Dii vostram fidem!
Itan' comparatam esse hominum naturam omnium
Aliena vt melius videant and judicent, quam sua?

Perpediti nimio, aut aegritudine? Hic mihi,
Nunc quanto plus sapit, quam egomet mihi?

Chapter Dissolvi me, otiosus ut operam tibi darem.

Act III. Scene 2.
Syrus, Chremes. Sy. RVn about this way and that way, yet I must find
Money, I must devise some trick for the old man.

Chapter I was not mistaken, that they were plotting about it, now verily
That same servant of Clinia's is a dullard,


S. Who talks here? I am undone. Has he heard these words?

Chapter Syrus.

S. Ha.

Chapter What do you there?

S. Truly Chremes I much wonder at you,
That you are up so early, who drunk so much yesterday.

Chapter Nothing too much.

S. Nothing say you! me thought as folks use to say,


Chapter No more of that.

S. This where is a pleasant and
Merry-conceited woman.

Chapter So she seemed indeed to me.

S. And truly of a clear complexion.

Chapter So and so.

S. Not so good as it was in times past, but as it is at this present.
And I do not wonder that Clinia is deep in love with her:

This neighbor of ours; do not you know him? And as if he had
Not means enough, his son for sook his country for want.
Do you know it to be done as I say?

Chapter Why should I but know?
A fellow that deserves the house of correction.

S. Whom do you mean?

Chapter I mean


S. O Syrus, I was cursedly afraid for *you.

Chapter Who suffered that thing to be done.

S. What should he have done?

Chapter Do you ask?
He should have found out some shift, and have devised wily tricks,
Whereby the young man might have somewhat to bestow on his sweetheart,
And might have saved this old man against his will, that is so hard to please.

S.

Chapter Syrus, these things ought to have been done by him.

S. Why, I pray you, do you commend those that deceive their masters?

Chapter In season
Truly I commend them.

S. Very well indeed.

Chapter Because
That is sometimes a remedy os great inconveniences.
Now his only son might have remained at home to this man.

S,
But indeed he gives me encouragement, that I may have more mind to do it.

Chapter And now, Syrus, what does he wait for? what whilst he go away
Hence again, seeing he cannot be able to bear her charges,
Does he not invent some cunning-trick to put upon the old man?

S. He a blockhead.


S. Truly I can soon do it, if you but say the word;
For I know very well, how it is wont to be done.

Chapter Verily you are so much the fitter man.

S. I am not used to dissemble.

Chapter Do it then.

S. But do you hear, be sure you remember these same things,
If any thing of this nature chance to befall at any time,
As humane things are casual, that your son should do the like.

Chapter It will not come to pass, I hope.

S. Truly I hope so too,
Nor do I speak it now therefore, because I perceived him go about any such
thing;
But if he should do any such thing, that you may not be angry at me; you see
what his age is.
Chremes, if need should be, I could handle you gallantly.

Chapter We will consider concerning that matter when occasion shall serve,
What shall be needful. Now mind what you have in hand.

S. I never heard my master speak more opportunely then now.
Nor when I went about to do a mischief, did I think


Actus III. Scen. 2.
Syrus, Chremes. Sy. HAc illac circumcursa, inveniendum tamen
Argentum, intendenda in senem est fallacia.

Chapter Non me fesellit hosce id struere, videlicet
Ille Cliniae servus tardiusculus est,


S. Quis hic loquitur? perii. Numnam haec audivit?

Chapter Sire.

S. Hem!

Chapter Quid tu is it ic?

S. Recte quidem te demiror, Chreme;
Tam mane, qui heri tantum b^beris.

Chapter Nihil nimis.

S. Nihil narras? visa vero est, quod dici solet,


Chapter Eja.

S. Mulier commoda and
Faceta haec est meretrix.

Chapter Sane idem vifa est mihi.

S. Et quidem hercle forma luculenta.

Chapter Sie satis.

S. Ita non ut olim, sed uti nunc sane, bona.
Minimeque miror; Glinia hanc si deperit.

Vicinum hunc, nostin? and quafi is non divitiis
Abundet, natus ejus profugit inopia;
Scin' esse factum ut dico?

Chapter Quid ego nesciam?
Hominem pistrino dignum.

S. Quem?

Chapter Istunc servulum


S. Sire, tibi timui male.

Chapter Qui passus est id fieri?

S. Quid faceret?

Chapter Rogas?
Aliquid reperiret, fingeret fallacias,
Unde esset adolescenti amicae quod daret,
Atque hunc difficilem invitum servaret senem.

S.

Chapter Haec facta ab illo oportebant, Sire.

S. Eho, quaeso, laudas qui heroes fallunt.

Chapter In loco
Ego vero laudo.

S. Recte sane.

Chapter Quippe quia
Magnarum saepe aegritudinum id remedium est,
Jam huic mansisset unicus gnatus domi.

S.
Nisi mihi qaidem addit animum, quo lubeat magis,

Chapter Et nunc quid expectat, Sire? an dum hinc denuo
Abeat, cum tolerare hujus sumptus non queat?
Nonne ad senem aliquam fabricam fingit?

S. Stolidus est,

Causa.

S. Facile quidem facere possum, si jubes:
Etenim quo pacto id fieri soleat, calleo.

Chapter Tanto hercle melior.

S. Non est mentiri meum.

Chapter Fac ergo.

S. At, heus tu, facito eadem haec memineris,
Si quid hujus simile, forte aliquand^ evenerit,
Ut sunt humana, tuus ut faciat filius.

Chapter Non usus veniet, spero.

S. Spero hercle ego quoque.
Neque eo nunc dico, quo quicquam illum senserim:
Sed si quid, nequid quae sit ejus aetas vides.

Tractare possim.

Chapter De istoc, cum usus venerit,
Videbimus quid opus sit; nunc istuc age.

S. Nunquam commodius unquam herum audiviloqui.
Nec, cum malefacerem, crederem mihi impunius


Act III. Scen. 3.
Chremes, Clitipho, Syrus. Chapter WHat is that I pray you? what behavior is that,
Clitipho?
Is it fitting to do so?

Cl. What have I done?

Chapter Did not I see you just now,
Put your hand into that whores bosom?

S. The matter is dashed, I am undone.

Cl. What me?

Chapter With these eyes.

That you cannot hold your hands? For indeed this is
A gross abuse, to entertain a man that is your friend
With you, and to busy your self with his sweetheart: even yesterday in your
wine
How immodest were you?

S. He was so.

Chapter How trouble some?

I know the mind of lovers, they take things in dudgeon
Which you would not imagine.

Cl. But he dare credit me,
Fathers that I will do no such matter.

Chapter Be it so; yet indeed
You should have gone somewhither a while out of their sight. Love

By my self. There is none of my friends at this day, Clitipho,
To whom I dare disclose all my secrets.
His worth hinders with one, with another it ir^eth me
Of what is done, lest I should seem to be foolish or saucie, which suppose him
to do.


S. What is he telling?

Cl. I am undone.

S. Clitipho, I discharging the duty
Of an honest and moderate person, do advise you these things.

Cl. Hold your peace, I pray you.

S. Very well indeed.

Chapter Syrus, I am ashamed.

S. I believe you, and not without cause; for it troubles me.

Cl. Do you go on


S. I speak the truth, what I think.

Cl. Should I not come
At them?

Chapter Why I pray you, is there but one way to come at them?

S, But he will first bewray him self, before I get the money.
Chromes, Will you hearken to me a foolish fellow?

Chapter What Shall I do?

S. ^id this man go some whither hence.

Cl. Whither should I go


S. Whither you list. Give them place. Go walk.

Cl. Walk, whither?

S Fie, as if you wanted a place.
Go forsooth this way, or that way, whither you will.

Chapter He says well
I suppose.

Cl. Syrus, an ill end come to thee
That thrustest me thence.

S. But do you hold those hands hereafter.
Chremes, he will do further,
Unless you observe, chastise, and admonish him, as far as God will enable you.

Chapter I will look to that.

S. But master, you must now look to him.

Chapter It shall be done.

S. If you be wise, for he regards me less and less.

Chapter Syrus, What say you? Have you done any thing about that matter, of which I
spoke to you a while ago?
Or have you found any thing that likes you, or not yet at all?

S. (...) you speak
About the trick? whilst I have found one lately.

Chapter You are an honest fellow, tell me what it is.

S. I will tell you, but as one thing fell out after another.

Chapter What is it Syrus?

S. This is a very naughty whore.

Chapter So she seems.

S. Nay, if you knew all.
See this prank which she begins to play. There was an old woman of Corinth
here.


Chapter What then? She died and left behind her a young daughter,
She was left as a pawn to this whore for that money.

Chapter I underderstand you.

S. She has brought her with her, and she is now with your wife.

Chapter What then?

S. Clinia entreats her to bestow her on him, and yet desires to give her


Chapter And will be indeed desire it?

S. Whoo, is that any question?

Chapter I thought so; what do you now think to do?

S. What I? I will go to Menedemus, and tell him she was bought from Caria,
Being rich, and a gentlewoman; if he will buy her again, much gain is to be
got by her.

Chapter You are mistaken.

S. Why so?

Chapter I will now answer you for Menedemus.


S. Speak as one would have you.

Chapter But there is no need.

S. Is there no need?

Chapter No indeed.

S. Why say you so? I wonder.

Chapter You shall know by and by* Tarry, tarry; what is the matter,
That our door creaks so much?

Act. III. Scen. 3.
Chremes, Clitipho, Syrus, Chapter QUid istuc, quaeso? qui istic mos est Clitipho?
Itane fieri oportet?

Cl. Quid ego feci?

Chapter Vid^n' ego te mod^
Manum in sinum huic meretrici ins^rere?

S. Acta haec res est, perii.

Cl. Mean?

Chapter Hisce oculis:

Illi, qui non abstaneas manum? nam istaec quidem
Contumelia est, hominem amicum recipere
Ad te, atque ejus amicam subagitare; Vel heri in vino
Quam immodestus fuisti?

S. Factum est.

Chapter Quam molestus?

Esset. Novi ego amantium animum, advortunt graviter,
Quae non censeas.

Cl. At mihi fides apud hunc est,
Nihil me istius facturum, pater.

Chapter Esto; at oerte
Coneedas aliquo ab ore ^orum aliquantisper. Multa fert

Apud alium prohibet dignitas, apud alium ipsius facti Piget, ne ineptus, ne
protervus videar: quod illum facere credito.


S. Quid istic narrat?

Clit. Perii.

S. Clitipho, haec ego
Praecipio tibi, hominis frugi and temperantis functus officio.

Cl. Tace, sodes.

S. Recte sane.

Chapter Sire, pudet me.

S. Credo, neque id injuria; quin mihi molestum est.

Cl. Pergin'


S. Verum dico, quod videtur.

Cl. Nonne accedam
Ad illos?

Chapter Eho, quaeso, una accedendi via est.

S. Atenim hic prius se indicaverit, quam ego argentum effero.
Chreme, vin'tu homini stulto mihi auscultare?

Chapter Quid Faciam?

S. J^be hunc abire hinc aliquo.

Cl. Quo ego hinc


S. Quo lubet. Da illis locum. Abi deambulatum.

Cl. Deambulatum? quo?

S. Vah, quasi desit locus.
Abi, sane, istac, istorsum, quo vis.

Chapter Recte dicit,
Censeo.

Cl. Dii te eradicent, Sire, qui me istinc
Extrudis.

S. At tu tibi istas posthac comprimito manus.

Nisi eum, quantum tibi op^s Dii dant, servas, castigas, mones?

Chapter Ego istuc curabo.

S. Atqui nunc, here, tibi adservandus est.

Chapter Fiet.

S. Si sapias; nam mihi jam minus minusque obtemperat.

Chapter Quid tu? ecquid de illo, quod dudum tecum egi, egistin', Sire?
Aut reperisti tibi quod placeat, an nondum etiam?

S. De fallacia
Dicis? est, inveni quandam nuper.

Chapter Frugies; cedo quid id est?

S. Dicam, verum ut aliud ex alio incidit.

Chapter Quidnam, Sire?

Chapter Pessima haec est meretrix.

Chapter Ita videtur.

S. Immo, si scias.
Hoc vide quod inceptat facinus. Fuit quaedam anus Corinthia hic;


Chapter Quid tum?

S. Ea mortua est: reliquit filiam adolescentulam,
Ea relicta huic arraboni est pro illo argento.

Chapter Intelligo.

S. Hanc secum huc adduxit, eaque est nunc ad uxorem tuam.

Chapter Quid tum?

S. Clinia orat sibi uti nunc det illam; illi tamen post daturum mill
(...). Nummum poscit.

Chapter Et pos^it quidem?

S. Hui, dubiumne
Id est?

Chapter Ego sic putavi. Quid nunc facere cogitas?

S. Egone? ad Menedemum ibo: dicam hanc esse captam ex Caria,
Ditem and nobilem; fi redimat, magnum in ea esse lucrum.

Chapter Erras.

S. Quid ita?

Chapter Pro Menedemo ego nunc tibi


S. Op^ata loquere.

Chapter Atqui non est opus.

S. Non opus est?

Chapter Non hercle vero.

S. Qui istuc? miror.

Chapter Jam scies. Mane, mane; quid est, quod tam.
A nobis graviter crepuere fores?

Act IV. Scene 1.
Sostrata, Chremes, Nutrix, Syrus. So. UNless I be deceived, surely this is the
ring, which I suppose it to be. That with which my daughter was exposed with.

Chapter Syrus, what means this talk?

So. What is it? Do not you think it
To be it?

N. Truly I told you presently, as soon as you showed it me,


So. But be sure that you now look well upon it,
My nurse.

N. I have viewed it sufficiently.

So. Now go your way in, and if she
Have already washed, bring me word. In the mean time I will tarry for my
husband here.

Sy. She would speak with you, you may see what she would have: I know not why
she is sad,
There Is some occasion: I fear what the matter should be.

Chapter What should it be? truly she


So. O ho, my husband.

Chapter O ho, my wife.

So. I am looking for you.

Chapter Speak, what
You would have.

So. First, I entreat you that you would not think
That I durst do any thing contrary to your command.

Chapter Would you have me
Believe you this, though it be a thing not to be believed? I believe you.

Sy. I know not


So. Do you not remember that I was with child,
And that you gave me very strict charge, that if I had a girl I should not
Bring it up?

Chapter I know what you have done, you have brought it up.

Sy. Have you done so?
Then, mistress, my master has received damage.

So. Not so,
But there was here an old woman of Corinth, an honest woman, I gave her to be
cast forth.

Chapter Jupiter, that you should be so void of wit!

So. I am undone.
What have I done?

Chapter But do you ask?

So. I have done amiss, my Chremes,
I have done it unwittingly.

Chapter I know that for certain, though you should say say to it,
That you both say and do all things unwittingly and unadvisedly;
You discover so many faults in this matter. For first now* if you would have
done

In words, and given her hope of life in very deed. But I pass by that; that
was but pity,
And a motherly mind, I bear with it. But how well have you look to it? what
did you intend?
Consider with your self, your daughter forsooth is most manifestly betrayed to
that old woman
By you, either to turn whore, or to be sold publicly. I think this was

That know neither right nor reason, what is fitting? be a thing better or
worse,
Be it for them, or against them, they regard nothing but what they list.

So. My Chremes,
I confess, I have offended, I am confuted; now I entreat you this, by how much
more
Experienced your mind is, and more inclinable to pardon, that your equity


Chapter Yes indeed
I will pardon that fault. But Sostrata, my gentleness does badly teach you
Many things. But what ever it be, speak, wherefore it was begun.

So. As we foolish and sorry women are all superstitious; when I gave her to
her to be exposed,
I plucked the ring from off my finger, and bade her expose it with the girl;


Chapter That is very well, you both saved your self and her.

So. This is that ring:

Chapter Whence had you it?

So. Of the young woman which Bacchis brought with her.

Sy. What now?

Chapter What does she say?

So. She whilst she went to wash her,
Gave me the ring to keep. I did not mind it at first, but after I looked upon
it, I knew it presently.


Chapter What now do you conjecture or find concerning her?

So. I know not, but you may ask of her, whence she had it, if she may
Be found.

Sy. I am undone, I see more hope then I would; she is ours, if it be so.

Chapter Is she alive to whom you gave her?

So. I know not.

Chapter What did she say
She did heretofore?

So. That which I bade her.

Chapter Tell me what was the name


So. Philtere.

Sy. That is she, it is a wonder
If she be not safe, and I undone.

Chapter Sostrata, follow me in this way.

So. How is it fallen out beyond my expectation! how greatly feared I, lest you
should be
As hard-hearted now, as you was heretofore, Chremes, about bringing her up!

Chapter A man may not be
Oftentimes as he would, if the matter do not permit. Now so is the time with
me that I desire


Sy. Unless I be deceived, an ill turn is not far off me,
My forces are now quite driven into such a narrow strait,
Except I find out some trick, that the old may not know this is his sons
sweetheart.
For there is nothing for me to hope on about getting the money, or that I
should desire
To deceive the old man; I shall be glad if I may get away with a whole skin.

What should I do? or what shall I devise? I must begin to reckon anew;
There is nothing so hard, but by searching it may be found out.
What if I should begin this thus? it is to no purpose. What if thus? I shall
do all one.
But I think it may be thus: it cannot be; Yes, very well; O brave! I have a
very fine way.
Truly I suppose I shall for all this draw into my fingers that same money
which is apt to be gone.

Act. IV. Scen. 1.
Sostrata, Chremes, Nutrix, Syrus. So. NIsi me animus fall it, hic profecto est
annulus, quem Ego suspicor. Is quicum exposita est gnata.

Chapter Quid vult sibi, Sire, haec oration?

So. Quid est? isne tibi
Videtur?

N. Dixi equidem, ubi mihi ostendisti,


So. At ut satis modo contemplata sis, mea Nutrix.

N. Satis.

So. Abi nunc jam intro, atque illa
Si jam laverit, mihi nuntia. Hic ego virum interea operibor.

Sy. Te vult: ut videas quid velit; nescio quid tristis est,
Non temere est: metuo quid sit.

Chapter Quid siet? nae ista hercle


So. Ehem, mi vir.

Chapter Ehem, mea uxor.

So. Teipsum quaero.

Chapter Loquere, quid Velis.

So. Primum hoc te oro, ne quid credas me advers^m Edictum tuum facere esse
ausam.

Chapter Vis me istuc tibi, etsi
Incredibile est, credere? credo.

Sy. Nescio quid peccati


So. Meministin' me esse gravidam,
Et mihi te maximo opere interminatum, si puellam parerem, nollc
Tolli?

Chapter Scio quid feceris, sustulisti.

Sy. Sic est factum?
Domina, Ergo herus damno auctus est.

So. Minime. Sed erat hic anus Corinthia haud impura, ei dedi exponendam.

Chapter

So. Perii.
Quid ego feci?

Chapter Atrogitas?

So. Si peccavi, mi Chremes,
Insciens feci.

Chapter Id quidem ego, etsi tu neges, certe scio,
Te inscientem atque imprudentem dicere ac facere omnia.
Tot peccata in hac re ostendis. Nam jam primum si meum imperium

Verbis, re ipsa spem vitae dare; at id omitto; miscricord^a,
Animus maternus, sino; quam been vero abs te prospectum est* quid voluisti?
Cogita: nempe anui illi prodita abs te filia est planissime,
Per te; vel uti quaestum faceret, vel uti veniret palam. Credo id

Qui neque, jus, neque bonum atque aequum sciunt? melius, pejus;
Prosit, obsit; nihil vident, nisi quod lubet.

So. Mi Chreme,
Peccavi, fateor, vincor; nunc hoc te obsecro, quanto tuus est
Animus natu gravior, ignoscentior, ut meae stultitiae


Chapter Scilicet equidem
Istuc factum ignoscam. Verum, Sostrata, male docet te mea facilitas
Multa. Sed istud quicquid est, qua hoc occeptum causa est, loquere.

So. Ut stultae and miserae omnes sumus religiosae; cum exponendam do
Illi, de digito annulum detraho, and cum dico ut una cum puella


Chapter Istuc recte, conservasti te atque illam.

So. Hic is est annulu^.

Chapter Unde habes?

So. Quam Bacchis secum adduxit adolescentulam.

Sy. Hem!

Chapter Quid ea narrat?

So. Ea lavatum dum it, servandum mihi
Dedit annulum. Non advorti primo; sed postquam aspexi, illico cognovi.


Chapter Quid nunc suspicare, aut invenis de illa?

So. Nescio, nisi ut ex ipsa quaeras, unde hunc habuerit, si potis est
Reperiri.

Sy. Interii, plus spei video quam volo; nostra est, si ita est;

Chapter Vivitne illa, cui tu dederas?

So. Nescio.

Chapter Quid renunciavit
Olim fecisse?

So. Id quod jusseram.

Chapter Nomen mulieris cedo


So. Philtere.

Sy. Ipsa est; mirum, ni
Illa salva est, and ego perii.

Chapter Sostrata, sequere intro hac.

So. Ut praeter spem evenit! quam timui male, ne nunc animo ita esses duro,
Ut olim in tollenda, Chreme!

Chapter Non licet hominem esse saepe
Ita ut vult, si res non sinit. Nunc ita tempus est mihi ut cupiam filiam, olim


Sy. Nisi me animus fall^t, haud multum a me aberit infortunium,
Ita hercle in angustum oppido nunc meae coguntur copiae:
Nisi aliquid video, ne esse amicam hanc gnati resciscat senex.
Nam quod de argento sperem, aut posse postulem, me fallere,
Nihil est; triumpho, si licet me latere tecto abscedere

Quid agam? aut quid comminiscar? ratio de integro ineunda est mihi.
Nihil tam difficile est, quin quaerendo investigari possiet.
Quid si hoc sic incipi^m? nihil est; fi sic? tantundem egero.
At sic opinor: non potest; immo, optume; euge, optumam habeo.
Retraham hercle opinor ad me idem illud fu gitivum argentum tamen.

Act IV. Scene 2.
Clinia, Syrus. Cl. NOthing hereafter can happen to me so weighty, which May
cause me any grief; this so great joy has befallen me.
I now yield my self to my father, to become more thrifty then he would have me.

Sy. The matter has not deceived me, as far as I hear by his words.


Cl. O my Syrus, have you heard I pray you?

Sy. What else, who was continually with them?

Cl. To whom did you ever hear any thing happen so well?

Sy. To ^^ man.

Cl. And I swear, I am not so much glad for my own sake,
As for hers, whom I know to deserve all the respect that may be.

S. Clinia, go to, let me have your help again.
For your friends business must also be looked to, that it may be made safe:
Lest the old man should now perceive any thing about the love.

Cl. O Jupiter!

Sy. Be quiet.

Cl. My Antiphila shall be married to me.

Sy. Do you so interrupt me in my speech!

Cl. What shall I do, my Syrus? I am glad: bear with me.

Sy. I do bear with you, but indeed.

Cl.

Sy. I suppose, I bestow my labor in vain.

Cl. Speak; I hear you.

Sy. But you will not now hear me this.

Cl. I will do it.

Sy. I say, Clinia, you must have a care of your friends business that it be
made safe:
For if you now go away from our house, and leave Bacchis here, the old man
will know
Presently that she is Clitipho's sweetheart; but if you have her away, it
will be concealed
So as it has been hitherto.

Cl. But Syrus, there is nothing more
Against my marriage; for with what face shall I speak to my father?
Do you understand what I should say?

Sy. What else?

Cl. What should I say? what excuse
Shall I make?

Sy. What? I would not have you lie; tell him plainly
How the matter is.

Cl. What say you?

Sy. I charge you, tell him that you
Clilipho's sweetheart.

Cl. You command me
A very honest and just thing, and easy to be done; and forsooth
You would now have me entreat my father this, that he would conceal it from
your old man.

Sy. Nay, I would have him tell all the matter downright in order.

Cl. Ha,
Are you well in your wits, and not drunk? Truly you go the way to undo him
quite; for how


Sy. Indeed I think this course
The best; herein I gallantly vaunt my self, that have so great power
In me, and ability of such craft, as that by telling the truth
I can deceive them both; that when our old man tells yours that she is
His sons sweetheart, he may not believe it for all that.

Clin. But by this means

That she is my sweetheart, he will not adventure his daughter. You perhaps,
Make small reckoning what shall become of me, so you may shift for him.

Sy. What
With a mischief, do you think I desire it to be dissembled long? its but for
one day,
Till I get the money, and no more.

Cl. Do you account so much enough?

As they that say, What if the sky should fall now?

Cl. I am afraid
What to do.

Sy. Are you afraid? as if it were not in your own power
To acquit your self what time you list, and make the matter manifest.

Cl. (...), (...) ^^c^his ^e brought.

Sir. In very good ti^^, she her self comes forth.

Actus IV. Scen. 2.
Clinia, Syrus. Cl. NUlla mihi res posthac potest jam intervenire tanta, quae
mihi Aegritudinem afferat: tanta haec laetitia aborta est,
Dedo patri me nunc jam, ut frugalior sim quam vult.

Sy. Nihil me fefellit, quantum audio hujus verba.


Cl. O mi Sire, audistin' obsecro?

Sy. Quid ni, qui usque una affuerim;

Cl. Cui aeque audisti commode quicquam evenisse?

Sy. Nulli.

Cl. Atque ita me Dii ament, ut ego nunc non tam meapte causa
Laetor, quam illius, quam ego scio esse honor quovis dignam.

Nam amici quoque res est videnda, in tuto ut collocetur;
Ne quid de amore nunc senex.

Cl. O Jupiter

Sy. Quiesce.

Cl. Antiphila mea nubet mihi.

Sy. Siccine me interloquere?

Cl. Quid faciam, mi Sire? gaudeo; fer me.

S. Fero, hercle vero

Cl.

S. Frustra operam, opinor sumo.

Cl. Loquere, audio.

S. At jam hoc non audies.

Cl. Agam.

S. Vid^ndum, inquam, amici quoque res, Clinia, tui in tuto ut collocetur:
Nam si nunc a nobis abis, and Bacchidem hic relinquis, senex rescisscet
Illico esse amicam hanc Clitiphonis: si adduxeris, celabitur
Itidem, ut celata est adhuc.

Cl. Atenim istoc nihil est magis
Sire, meis nuptiis adversum: nam quo ore appellabo patrem?
Tenes, quid dicam?

Sy. Quidni?

Cl. Quid dicam? quam causam
Afferam?

Sy. Quid? nolo mentiare, aperte ita ut res sose
Habet, narrato.

Cl. Quid ais?

Sy. Jubeo illam te


Cl. Bonam
Atq: justam rem oppido imperas, and factu facilem; and scilicet
Jam me hoc voles patrem exorare, ut celet senem vestrum.

Sy. Imo, ut recta via rem narret ordine omnem.

Cl. Hem,
Satin' sanus es and sobrius? Tu quidem illum plane perd^s; nam qui


Sy. Huic equidem consilio
Palmam do, hic me magnifice effero, qui vim tantam
In me and potestatem habeam tantae astutiae, vera dicendo
Ut eos ambos fallam; ut cum narret senex noster vestro istam esse
Amicam gnati, non credat tamen.

Cl. At enim spem istoc

Hanc meam esse credet, non committet filiam. Tu fortasse
Quid me fiet, parvi pendis, dum illi consulas.

Sy. Quid,
Malum me aetatem censes velle id assimularier? Unus est dies,
Dum argentum eripio^ nihil amplius.

Cl. Tantum sat habes?


Sy. Quid si redeo
Ad illos, qui aiunt, Quid si nunc coelum ruat?

Quo velis in tempore ut te exsolvas, rem facias palam.

Act IV. Scene 3.
Bacchis, Clinia, Syrus, Dromo, Phrygia. B. TRuly, Syrus's his promises have
saucily enough brought me hither
For the ten pounds which be promised me. But if he shall now
D^ceive me, he shall come in vain, often entreating me to come.
Or when I shall have told him, and appointed that I will come, when he
Clitipho shall then hang in hope,
I will deceive him and not come; I shall make Syrus's back to smart for it.

Cl. She promises you pretty well. But do you think she jesteth?
She will do it, except I take heed.

B. They are asleep, but indeed
I will rouse them. My Phrygia, did you not hear even now, what country house
Charinus's that fellow showed us?

Ph. I heard him.

B. He said it was next
To this ground on the right hand.

Ph. I remember it.

B. Run
Apact; the soldier keeps with him a feast to Bacchus.

Sy. Why does she begin these things?

B. Tell him, that I am here sore against my will, and that I am kept perforce,
But that I will deceive them one way or other, and will come.

Sy. Bacchis, tarry, tarry; whither do you send that maid, I pray you?
Bid her tarry.

B. Go your way.

Sy. But the money is ready.

B. But I tarry here.

Sy. But it shall be given you by and by.

B. As you please; do I urge you?

Sy. But I pray you, know you not what you are to do?

B. What?

Sy. You must now step, over to Menedemus house, and all your train,
Must be brought over thither.

B. What do you do, you rogue?

Sy. What I? I am coining the money.
Which I must give you.

B. Do you think me fit to make a fool on?

Sy. It is not for nothing.

B. What have you any thing to do with me here?

Sy. No, I will but give you your own.

B. Let us go.

Sy. Follow me this way. Ho Dromo.

Dr. Who would have any thing with me?

Sy. Syrus.

Dr. What is the matter? Bring over all Bacchis maids hither to your house
quickly.

Dr. Why so?

Sy. Do not stand to ask.
And let them bring what things they brought with them hither. The old man will
hope

This little gain may bring him. You know not what you do know,
D^omo, if you be wise.

Dr. You shall tell them, I will be as mute as a Fish.

Chremes, Syrus. Chapter I Swear, I pity Menedemus's hap,
That so much mischief has befallen him,
As to maintain that woman with all her family,
Though I know he will not be sensible of it these two or three days,

But when he shall see that he shall be daily at such charges
In housekeeping, and that there will be no mean,
He will wish again that his son were gone from him.
I see Syrus in good time, Lo where he is.

Sy. Do I make no haste to set on him?

Chapter Syrus.

Sy. Ha.

Chapter

Sy. I wished long ago to have met with you.

Chapter Me thinks you have been doing something now with the old man,
I know not what.

Sy. Do you mean about that which you spoke of ere-while? I fully dista^ched it.

Chapter What in good earnest?

Sy. In good earnest truly.

Chapter I cannot forbear,
But I must stroke thy bead. Come hither to me, Syrus,


Sy. But if you knew how prettily it came into my mind.

Chapter Fie do you brag, that it fell out according to your mind?

Sy. No, indeed, I tell you the truth.

Chapter Tell me what it is.

Sy. Cli^i^ told Menedemus that this Bacchis
Clitipho's sweetheart, and that he brought her with him
For that reason, for fear you should fully perceive it.

Chapter Very well.

Sy. Speak in good sooth.

Chapter I say it is too too well.

Sy. Yes, so far well enough.
But bear further, what bravery remains;
He will tell you that himself saw your daughter,


Sy. Her,
And that he would fain have her to wife.

Chapter Does he mean her which was found erewhile?
And he will bid that she be required.

Chapter Why say you that Syrus?
For I understand nothing at all.

Sy. Tush, you are a dullard.

Chapter Perhaps so.

Sy. He shall have money given him for the marriage,


Chapter Let him get it.

Sy. That same is it.

Chapter But I will neither give nor promise her to him.

Sy. No? why?

The Argument or Plot of Adelphi, by Caeius Sulpicius Apollinaris.
WHere as Demea had two young men to his sons,
He gives Aeschines to his brother Mitio to be adopted,
But keeps Ctesipho with himself. This Ctesipho
Being caught with the pleasant deportment of a minstrelless,

His brother Ae^chinus concealed, and took upon him too
The report of his love, and at last
He took the m^nstre less from the bawd by force. This same Aeschinus
Had defloured a poor girl a citizen of Athens;

After the truth was discovered, Aeschinus married
The maid the citizen of Athens, that he had defloured;
Ctesipho enjoys the minstrelless as his wife,
His harsh father D^mea being over-intreated with much ado.
Adelphorum argumentum; C. Sulpicio Apollinari authore.
DUos cum haberet Demea adolescentulos,
Dat Mitioni fratri adoptandum Aeschinum,
Sed Ctesiphonem retinet. H^haristriae
Lepore captum, sub doro ac t^i^ti patre,

Amoris in se transferebat, benique
Fidicinam lenoni eripuit. Vitiaverat
Idem Aeschinus civem At^icam pauperculam;
Fidenque dederat, hanc sibi uxo^em fore.

Ut veritas patefacta est, ducit Aes^hinus
A se vitiatam civem Atticam virginem;
Uxore potitur Ctesipho citharistria,
Exo ato suo patre duro Demea.

The Prologue.
Forasmuch as the Poet perceived his Comedy, which we are to act,
To be pryed into by carping men, and that his adversaries
Wrest all to the worse sense:
He will lay open himself, and you shall be the judges,

Synapothnescontes is a Comedy of Diphilus's,
Plautus made it a Comedy called Commorientes;
In the Greek Comedy there is a young man that took forsibly
A whore from a bawd; in the first part of the Comedy, Plautus
Terence has taken it to himself
Into his Adelphi, and has translated it word by word.
We are to act it as a new one. Consider well,
Whether you think there is a theft committed, or a place
Taken in, which was omitted by Plautus's negligence;

Do help him, and write together with him day by day;
What they think to be a mighty disgrace,
He takes it to be a very great commendation, forasmuch as he likes them
Who give content to you all in general, and the people also,

Every one used, as his occasions were, without disdain.
Furthermore, do not expect (I should tell you) the plot of the Comedy.
The two old men that will come first, will discover part,
Others will show apart in the acting. See, that your indifferency
May add to the Poet's industry for writing.
Prologus.
POstquam Poeta sensit scripturam suam
Ab iniquis observari, and adversarios
Rapere in pejorem partem, quam acturi sumus:
Indicio de se ipse erit, vos eritis judices,

Synapothneseontes Diphili comoedia est,
Eam Commorientes Plautus fecit fabulam:
In Graeca adolescens est, qui lenoni eripuit
Mere^icem; in prima fabula, eum Plautus locum

In Adelphos, verbum de verbo expressum extulit.
Eam nos acturi sumus novam; Pernoscite,
Furtu^ne factum existumetis, an locum
Reprehensum, qui praeteritus negligentia est.

Eum adjutare, assidueque una scribere:
Quod illi maledictum vehemens esse existimant,
Eam laudem hic ducit maxumam, cum illis placet,
Qui vobis universis, and populo placent;

Suo quisque tempore usus est sine superbia.
Dehinc ne expectetis argumentum fabulae;
Senes qui primi venient duo, partem aperient,
In agendo partem ostendent. Facite, aequanimitas

Act. I. Scen. I.
MITIO. M. STorax! Aeschinus is not come back again this night from supper,
Nor any one of my servants which went to meet him?
Indeed this is true that folks say if one be absent any where,
Of if one linger anywhere, it were better that those things should fall out,

Being angry, then those things which tender parents conceit
If you linger your w^fe thinks either that you love some body else,
Or t^t y^u are beloved of some body, or that you are tippling, or taking your
pleas^re,
And that you alone are in a good condition, when she is in an evil case.

With what things am I now troubled? fear be should be starved,
Or fallen somewhere, or have broken some joins of him.
Ah, that any man should propose in his mind, no
Provide what may be dearer then he is to himself!

Of another dispositi^n: now ever since I was a youth,
I h^ve followed this quiet citizen's life, and my own ease,
And that which they account to be a happy thing,
I never had a wife; he is as far on the other side, be follows all these,

Sparingly and hardly; he has married a wife, he has two sons
Born him; thereupon I adopted this elder son to my self.
I have brought him up of a little one, I have esteemed, and loved him as my
own;
I take pleasure in him, that thing is my only darling.

I give him (what he would have) I leave him to his liberty, I think it not
necessary
To do all things as I may my self. Lastly, what others do,
Unknown to their fathers, which youth prompteth,
I have used my son, not to conceal them from me.

Dare to do it, will so much the more dare to do it to others.
I think it better to keep in children
With bash fullness and freedom, then with fear.
In these things my brother and I do not agree, nor do they please him.
Mitio?
Why do you spoil us the young man? why is he in love?
Why does he tipple? why do you allow him expenses in these things?
You let him go too brave; you are too fond and foolish.
He himself is too rigorous beyond all right and reason:

Who thinks a government to be more settled and firm
Which is maintained by force, then that which is gotten by good will.
This is my opinion, and thus I am persuaded in my mind;
He that does his duty being constrained through smart,

If he hope it may be carried closely he returns to his old bias again.
He whom you gain by a courtesy, does what he does heartily,
He studieth to requite you; he will be all one, be he present or absent.
This is a fatherly part, rather to accustom a son

Herein does a father and a master differ. He that cannot do this,
Let him confess he knows not how to command children.
But is not this be himself of whom I was speaking? yea verily it is he.
I know not why I see him so sad; I believe he will chide even now,
Demea, I am glad you are come in safety hither.

MITIO. M. STorax! non rediit haec nocte a caena Ae^chinus,
Neque servulorum quisquam qui adversum ierant?
Profecto hoc vere di^unt: si absis uspiam,
Aut ubi si cesses, evenire ea satius est,

Irata, quam illa quae parents propitii.
Uxor, si cesses, aut te amare cogitat,
Aut tete amari, aut potare, aut animo obsequi,
Et tibi been esse soli, cum sibi sit male.

Quibus nunc solicitor rebus? ne aut ille alserit,
Aut uspiam ceciderit, aut perfregerit aliquid.
Vah, quemqua ^ne hominum in animum instituere, aut
Parare, quod sit carius quam ipse est sibi!

Dissimili studio est; jam inde ab adolescentia,
Ego hanc clementem vitam urbanam, atque otium
Secutus sum, and, quod fortunatum isti putant,
Uxorem nunquam habui: ille contra, haec omnia,

Se habere; uxorem duxit, nati filii
Duo: inde ego hunc majorem adoptavi mihi:
Eduxi a parvulo, habui, amavi pro meo;
In eome oblecto: solum id est carum mihi.

Do, permitto; non necesse habeo omnia
Pro meo jure agere: postremo, alii clanculum
Patres quae faciunt, quae fert adolescentia,
Ea ne me celet, assuefeci filium.

Audebit, tanto magis audebit caeteros.
Pudore, and liberalitate liberos
Retinere satius esse credo, quam metu.
Haec fratri mecum non convenient, neque placent.
Mitio?
Cur perdis adolescentem nobis? cur amat?
Cur potat? cur tu his rebus sumptum suggeris?
Vestitu nimio indulges; nimium ineptus es.
Nimium ipse est durus, praeter aequui and bonum:

Qui imperium credat gravius esse aut stabilius,
Vi quod fit, quam illud quod amici^ia adjungitur.
Mea sic est ratio, and sic animum induco meum,
Malo coactus qui suum officium facit,

Si sperat fore clam, rursum ad ingenium redit.
Ille quem beneficio adjungas, ex animo facit;
Studet par refer, praesens absensque idem erit.
Hoc patrium est, potius consuefacere filium,

Hoc pater ac dominus interest. Hoc qui nequit,
Fateatur nescire imperare liberis.
Sed estne hic ipsus de quo agebam? and certe is est.
Nescio quid tristem video; credo jam, ut solet,

DEMEA. MITIO. D. OH ^in very good time: it is even you that I looked for.

M. Why are you so sad?

D. Do you ask me, and know where Aeschinus is, why I am so sad?
Did not I tell you this would come to pass?

M. What has he done?

D. What has he done?
Who is not ashamed of any thing, nor fears any man; nor thinks he himself

Heretofore; what aetrick has he played but lately?

M. What is that?

D. He has broken open the doors, and has rusht violently in
Into another man's house: he has beaten the good man himself
And all his family, and almost killed them; he has forcibly taken away

Done: how many folks, Mitio, have told me this as I was coming to you!
It is in all peoples mouths; and to be short,
If an example be to be compared with him, he does not see his brother
To be busied about husbandry, to be thriftie and te^perate in the country;
Mitio,
I tell you, you suffer him to be spoiled.

M. Never was there any thing more unreasonable then an ignorant fellow,
Who thinks nothing to be right, but what he does himself.

D. To what purpose is this?

M. Because you, Demea, judge amiss of this matter:

To haunt whores, nor to fuddle, it is no fault, nor to break open
Doors: if neither I nor you did these things,
Want of means did not suffer us to do them. Now you account that
For your commendation, which you did then through want.

We should have done it: and if you were a wise man, you would suffer
That son of yours to do it now, whilst age will give him leave,
Rather then, when he has buried you, whose death he has long expected,
To do these things afterward for all that in a more unfitting age.

D.
Is it not a heinous matter for a young man to do these things?

M. Pish,
Hear me. Do not trouble my head about this thing too often.
You gave me your Son to be adopted;
He is now become mine: if he do amiss, Demea, in any thing,

He feasteth, he fudleth, he smells of perfumes at my charges.
Does he love? I will allow him money, when I think it sitting;
When I think it not fitting, perhaps he shall be pack't out of doors.
Has he broken any doors? they shall be repaired, has he rent any clothes?
they shall be mended.

Lastly, either give over, or appoint whom you will to be judge betwixt us.
I will make it appear that you offend more in this matter then I.

D. W^ is me.
Learn to be a father of them, who know indeed, what it is to be one.

M. You are his father by nature, and I by my advising him.

D

M. Pish, if you hold on, I will ^be gone.

D. Do you serve me so?

M. Should I hear you so often about the same matter?

D. I have a care over him.

M. And I have a care over him. But, Demea,
Let us both care an equal share. Do you care for the one,
And I also for the other. For for you to take care of both, is in a manner


D. Ah. Mitio.

M. I think so.

D. Why am I against it? If that content you,
Let him lavish it, let him waste it, let him come to naught. It is nothing at
all to me.
Now if I speak any one word hereafter.

M. Are you angry again,
Demea?

D. Do not you believe it? Do I demand again whom I have given?

You would have me look to one; I do look to him, and I thank God.
Forasmuch as he is so, as I would have him to be, and that your son shall feel
Hereafter himself. I will say no worse against him.

M. Something, but not-all is true that he says; nevertheless

That I am grieved at it; for he is such a man,
When I pacify him, I am all I can against him, and terrify him from his
purpose:
Yet he scarcely takes it as a man ought to do; but if I should increase
Or else help forward his angry fit,
Aeschinus
Does us some wrong in this business.
What whore is there that he has not been in love with, or on whom has he not
bestowed
Something or other? At the last now of late (I think he was now grown weary
Of them all) he says he has a mind to marry a wife.

I was glad of it. And l^e his resolution of a fresh; but what ever it is,
I will know, and meet with the fellow, if he be in the market.

M. Quid fecit?

D. Quid ille secerit?
Quem neque pudet quiequam, nec metuit quemquam, neque legem putat

O^ i^o; modo quid distignavit?

M. Quidnam id est?

D. Fores effregit, atque in aedes irruit
Alienas; ipsum dominum atque omnem familiam
Multavit usque ad mortem: cripuit mulierem,

Factum esse: hoc advenienti quot mihi, Mitie,
Direre; in ore est omni populo; denique,
Si conferendum exemplum est, non fratrem videt
Rei dare operam, ruri esse parcum ac sobrium?
Mitio,
Dico, tibi dico, tu illum corrumpi sinis.

M. Homine imperito nunquam quicquam inj^stius est;
Qui, nisi quod ipse facit, nihil rectum putat.

D. Quorsum istuc?

M. Quia tu, Demea, hoc male judicas;

Scortari, neque potare, non est, neque fores
Effringere: haec si neque ego, neque tu fe^imus,
Non sivit egestas facere nos. Tu nunc tibi
Id laudi ducis, quod tunc secisti inopia.

Faceremus: and tu illum tuum, si esses homo,
Sineres nunc facere, dum per aetatem licet,
Potius quam ubi te expectatum ejecisset f^r^s,
Alienore aetate post facere tamen.

D.
Non est flagitium facere haec adolescentulum?

M. Ah,
Ausculta. Ne me obtundas de hac re saepius.
Tuum filium dedisti ad^ptandum mihi;
Is meus est factus; si quid peccat, Demea,

Obsonat, potat, olet unguenta de meo.
Amat? dabi^u a me argentum, dum erit commodum;
Ubi non erit, fortasse excludetur for as.
Fores eff^^g^? restituentur. discidit vestem? resarcictur.

Poste^o, aut desine, aut cedo quemvis arbit^um:
Te plura in hac re peceare ostendam.

D. Hei mihi!
Pater esse disce ab illis, qui vere s^iunt.

M. Natura to illi pater es, consiliis ego.

D.

M. Ah, si pergis, abiero.

D. Siccine agis?

M. An ego te toties de eadem re audiam?

D. Curae est mihi.

M. Et mihi curae est; verum, Demea,
Curemus aequam uterque partem: tn alterum,
Ego item alterum: nam ambos curare, propemodum


D. Ah. Mitio.

M. Mihi sic videtur.

D. Quid istuc* Si tibi istuc places,
Persundat, perdat, pereat, nihil ad me attinet.
Iam si verbum ullum posthac.

Unum vis curem; curo; and est Diis gratia,
Cum ita ut volo, est, iste tuus ipse sentiet

M. Nec nihil, neque omnia haec sunt, quae dicit, tamen

Me aegre pati illi nolui; nam ita est homo;
Cum placo, adversor sedulo and deterreo,
Tamen vix humane patitur: verum si augeam,
Aut etiam adjutor sim ejus iracundiae,

Nonnullam in hac^re nobis facit injuriam.
Quam hic non amavit meretriem, aut cui non dedit
Aliquid? Postremo nuper (credo jam omnium
Taedebat) dicit velle uxorem ducere.

Gaudebam. Ecce autem de integro; nisi quidquid est,
Volo scire, atque hominem convenire, si apud forum est.

Act. II. Scen. I.
SANNIO. AESCHINUS. S. I Beseech you, neighbors, help a poor innocent man,
Succor one that needs help.

Aesch. Leasurely, stand now here without any more ado.
Why do you look back? There is no danger. This fellow shall never meddle with
you,
Whilst I am here.

S. I will keep her in despite of all your teeths.

Aesch.

S. Aeschinus hear me, that you may not say you was ignorant of my condition of
life.
I am a bawd.

M. I know it.

S. But such a one, as any one of the best credit has been in any place.
That you should excuse your self hereafter, that you were loath this wrong
should have been done
To me, I will not value it thus much. Believe me this, I will defend my own
right;

I know these words of yours, you were loath it should have been done. Oath will
be given, that you do not deserve
To have this wrong offered you, where as I my self am unworthily dealt withal.

Aesch. Go valerously on, and open the door.

S. But, you had as good do nothing herein.

Aesch. Go you your ways in even now.

S. But I will not suffer him.

Aesch. Come hither, Parmeno;

Have a care, you do not turn your eyes any whither from mine, that there be no
stay, if
I wink to you, but your fist may be presently about his ears.

Sa. I would have him
To try that.

Aes. Oh, save her. Let the woman go.

Sa. O wretched
Act!

Aesch. He shall give you as much more, unless you take heed.

S. Oh the wretchedness!

Aesch. I had not winked to you


S. What a thing is this?
Aeschinus, have you the Kingly command here?

Aesch. If I had, you should be rewarded
According to your deserts.

S. What have you to do with me?

Aesch. Nothing.

S. What?
Do you know who I am?

Aesch. I do not desire.

S. Have I meddled with any thing of yours?

Aesch. If you had meddled with any thing,
You should have smarted for it.

S How comes it to be more lawful for you to have mine, for whom*


Aesch. It would have been better for you not to have railed
On me before the door. For if you go on to trouble me, you shall presently be
haled in,
And be there scourged with whip-thongs to death.

S A freeman with whip-thongs?

Aesch. It shall be so.

S. O wicked fellow! Do men say that here is like freedom to all men?

Aesch. If you have brawled enough, bawd, hear me now if you be disposed.

S. And I, have I brawled?


Aesc. Let those things pass, and return to the point*

S. What thing?
Whither should I return?

Aesch. Would you have me now tell you what may concern you?

S. I desire it, so it be any thing honest.

Aesch. Whoo, the bawd would not have me speak dishonest things.

S. I am a bawd, I confess, a common destruction of young men, a perfidious
fellow, a plague;
Yet I have done you no wrong.

Aes. For that truly remains yet to be done.

San. Aeschinus, go back thither, where you begun.

Aesch. You bought her,
For twenty pounds, (which thing may it never thrive with thee) so much money
shall be paid you.

S. What if I will not sell her? will you force me?

Aesch. No.

S. For I was afraid of that.

Aesch. For I think she should not be offered to be sold who is a freewoman;
For I by laying on my hand restore her to her liberty upon an action of
freedom. Now choose you,

Till I return again.

S. O mighty Jupiter! I do not wonder at them that begin.
To run mad after they have done wrong. He has pulled me out of my house, he
has beaten me,
He has taken away my woman, whether I will or no; for these ill turns he
requires
I should deliver her for so much as I bought her. Oh, he has given me poor
man above 500

What is his own by right. Well, now I desire it were done, if so be he would
but pay my money.
But I guess this, when I shall say I will give him her for so much, he will
presently take witness,
That I have sold her; I do but dream of my money, by and by, come again
tomorrow. I can
Endure that, if he will but pay it: though it be a wrongful business; but I
consider,

Of young men. But no body will give it me; in vain
Do I cast up these accounts with my self.

Act. 2. Scen. 1.
SANNIO, AESCHINUS. S. OBsecro, populares, ferte misero atque innocenti
auxilium, Subvenite inopi.

Aesch. Otiose, illico jam nunc hic consiste.
Quid respectas? nihil pericli est. Nunquam, dum ego
Adero, hic te tanget.

S. Ego istam invitis omnibus.

Aesch.

S. Aeschine aud^, ne te ignarum fuisse dicas meorum morum,
Leno ego sum.

M. Scio.

S. At ita, ut usquam fuit fide quisquam optuma.
Tu quod te posterius purges, hanc injuriam mihi nolle
Factum esse, hujus non faciam. creed hoc, ego meum jus pros^ quar;

Novi ego vestra haec, nolle factum; jusjurandum dabitur, te esse
Indignum injuria hac: indignis cum ego met sim acceptus modis.

Aesch. Abi praestrenue, ac sores aperi.

S. Caeterum, hoc nihil facis.

Aesch. I intro jam nunc tu.

S. At enim, non sinam,

Aesch. Accede huc, Parmeno;

Cave nunc jam oculos a meis quoquam dimoveas tuos, ne mora sit, si
Innuero, quin pugnus continuo in mala haereat.

S. Istuc volo
Ego ipsum experiri.

Aesch. Hem serva, omit mulierem.

S. O miserum
Facinus!

Aesch. Geminabit, nisi caves.

S. Hei miseriam!

Aesch. Non innueram,


S. Quid hoc rei est?
Regnumne Aeschine, hic tu possides?

Aes. Si possiderem, ornatus esses
Ex tuis virtutibus.

S. Quid tibi rei mecum est?

Aes. Nihil.

S. Quid?
Nostin' quis sim?

Aesch. Non desidero.

S. Tetigin' tui quicquam?

Aesch. Si attigisses,
Ferres infortunium.

S. Qui tibi magis licet meam habere, pro qua ego


Aesch. Ante aedes non fecisse erit
Melius hoc convitium. Nam si molestus perges esse, jam intro abripiere;
Atque ibi usque ad necem operiere loris.

S. Loris liber!

Aesc. Sic erit.

S. O hominem impurum! hiccine libertatem aiunt esse aequam omnibus?

Aesch Si satis debacchatus es, leno, audi, si vis, nunc jam.

S. Egone debacchatus


Aesch. Mitte ista, atque ad rem redi.

S. Quam rem?
Quo redeam?

Aes. Jamne me vis dicere quod ad te attinet?

S. Cupio, modo aequi aliquid.

Aesch. Vah, leno iniqua me non vult loqui.

S. Leno sum, fateor, pernicies communis adolescentium, perjurus, pestis:
Tamen tibi a me nulla est orta injuria.

Aes. Nam herele etiam id restat.

Sa.

Aesc. Minis viginti tu illam
Emisti (quae res tibi male vertat) argenti, tantum dabitur.

S. Quid si ego tibi illam nolo vendere? cogesne?

Aesch. Mi^ime.

S. Namque id ^^tui.

Aesch. Neque venundandam ceuseo, quae libera est:
Nam ego liberali illam assero causa manu. Nunc vide utrum vis
Argentum accipere, an causam meditari tuam, Delibera hoc, dum ego
Redeo, leno.

S. Proh sum Jupiter! minime mirer, qui infanite
Oc^ipiunt ex injuria. Domo me eripuit, verberavit; me invito
Abduxit meam. Ob malefacta haec tantidem emptam postulat sibi
Tradier. O, homini misero plus quingentos colaphos

Jas postulat. Age, jam cupio, si modo argentum reddat. Sed ego
Hoc atiolor, ubi me dixero dare tanti, testes faciat illico
Vendidisse me. De argento somnium, mox, cras redi. Id quoque
Possum far, si modo reddat: quanquam injurium est; verum cogito
Id quod res est, quando eum quaestum incepetis, accipienda and
Mussitanda injuria adolescentium est. Sed nemo dabit; frustra
Ego mecum has rations deputo.

Act. II. Scen. II.
SYRUS, SANNIO. Sy. HOld your peace, I my self will go meet with him, I will
make him new glad to take it.
And that he said he is well dealt withal. What is that Sannio, that I hear you
Quarrelled with my master, I know not what about?

Sa. I never saw a quarrel
More unjustly carried, then this which was to day betwixt us. I with bearing
blows,


Sy. Through your own fault.

Sa. What
Should I do?

Sy. You should have humoured the young man.

San. How could I do it
Better, who have continually suffered him to beat me?

Sy. Come on, do you know what I would say?
To set light by money when occasion serves is sometimes the greatest gain.
Whoo, you were afraid,
If you had now yielded from your right a little, and had conformed your self
to the young man,


Sa. I do not buy hope with ready money.

Sy. You will never grow rich.
Go your way, you know not how to bring men to your lure, Syrus.

Sa. I believe that were
Better; but I was never so crafty; but rather whatever I could,
I had rather take it for the present.

Sy. Go too, I know your mind,

And besides they say that you are going to Cyprus.

Sa. Tush.

Sy. And you have bought
Many things, which you are to carry hence thither, and that a ship is hired:
I know this,
You are in a doubt what to do; I hope when you return thence, for all this
you will mind this business.

Sa. I will not st^r a foot any whither: I am undone; he has begu^ this upon
this hope.

Sy. He is afraid
I have made the fellow he cannot tell what to do. O roguery! mark this.
He has come upon me in the very instant. I have bought many women, and other
things
Which I am to transport hence into Cyprus: except I come thither to the mart,
I shall lose very much.
If I omit this now, I shall do up good in my suit, when I return thence, there
is nothing to be had.
The suit is grown cold, now you come at last; why did you suffer it? where was
you?

Then.

Sy Have you now cast up what you think will be coming to you?

Sa. Is this a thing fitting for him to do? that Aeschinus should offer to do
this, to desire
By force to take her from me?

Sy. He begins to quail. I have but this one thing to say.
Consider it, if you like well; divide the whole, rather then come into danger,
Sannio whether you shall save or lose all, He will make hard shift to get ten
pounds
Somewhere or other.

Sa. Woe is me, now I poor man come to doubt of the principal.
He is ashamed of nothing, he has made all my teeth loose, besides all my head
is soft
As a fuz-ball with his boxes, and would he defraud me too? I am going no
whither hence.

Sy. Do as you please; will you have any thing else? for I must be gone.

Sa. Yes indeed; this
Syrus, however these things have been done, yet rather then I will follow
suites,
Let me have my own paid me, or at least as much as she cost me. Syrus, I know
you never
Made use of my friendship heretofore; you shall say I am both mindful and
thankful.

Sy. I will do the best I can: but I see Ctesipho, he is glad for his
sweetheart

Sa. What is it that I entreat you to do?

Sy. Stay a little while.

Act. II. Scen. II.
SYRUS, SANNIO. Sy. TAce, egomet conveniam ipsum, ut cupide accipiat jam f^xo.
Been dicat secum actum. Quid istuc, Sannio, quod te audio
Nescio quid concertasse cum hero?

San. Nunquam vidi iniqu^us
Certationem comparatam, quam haec quae hodie inter nos fuit. Ego vapulando,


Sy. Tua culpa.

San. Quid
Agerem?

Sy. Adolescenti morem gestum oportuit.

San. Qui potui
Melius, qui hodie usque os praebui?

Sy. Age, scis quid loquar?
Pecuniam in loco negligere, maximum interdum est lucrum. Hui, metuisti,
Si nunc de tuo jure contulisses paululum, atque adolescenti

Istuc foeneraret.

Sa. Ego spe^ pretio non emo.

Sy Nunqua^ re^ facies,
Abi, nescis inescare homines, Sannio.

San. Credo istuc melius
Esse; verum ego nunqua^ adeo astutus fui; quin quicquid possem,
Mallem auserrem potius in praesentia.

Sy. Age, novi tuum

Praeterea autem te aiunt proficisci Cyprum.

Sa. Hem.

Sy. Coemisse
Hinc quae illuc veheres multa, navem conductam; hoc scio,
Animus tibi pendet; ubi illinc, spero, redieris, tamen hoc ages.

Sa. Nusquam pedem; perii hercle, hac ille spe hoc incepit.

Sy. Timet.
Injeci scrupulum homini.

Sa. O scelera! illuc vide in ipso
Articulo oppressit, emptae mulieres complures, and item hinc alia,
Quae porto Cyprum; nisi eo ad mercatum venio, damnum maximum est.
Nunc si hoc omittam, actum agam ubi illine rediero; nihil est,
Refrixerit res, nunc demum venis: cur passus? ubi eras?

Persequi.

Sy. Jamne enumerasti id quod ad te rediturum putas?

Sa Hoccine illo dignum est? hoccine incipere Aeschinnm, per oppressionem
Ut hanc mihi eripere postulet?

Sy. Labascit. Unum hoc habeo,
Vide si satis placet; dividuum face, potius quam venias in periculum,
Sannio, servesne an perdas ^otum. Minus december conradet
Alicunde.

Sa. Hei mihi, etiam de forte nunc verio in dubium miser.
Pudet nihil, omnes dentes labefecit mihi: praeterea colaphis
Tuber est totum caput; etiam insuper defraudet? nusquam abeo.

Sy. Ut lubet; nunquid vis, quin abeam?

Sa. Imo hercle hoc
Sire, ut ut haec sunt facta, potius quam lites sequar,
Meum reddatur, saltem quanti empta est, Sire. Scio te non esse usum
Antehac amicitia mea; memorem me dices esse, and g^at^^^.

Sy. Sedulo faciam: sed Ctesiphonem video, laetus est de amica.

Sa. Quid, quod te oro?

Sy. Paulisper mane.

CTESIPHO. SYRUS. Ct. ONe would be glad to receive a courtesy from any man,
when need is,
But indeed that courtesy only brings delight, if he do it, to whom it
belongs of right to do it.
O brother, brother, how should I now commend you? I know very will I can never
speak
Any thing so high, but your desert goes beyond it: and therefore I think, I
have this one

That is more excellent in the chiefest feats.

Sy. O Ctesipho.

Ct. O Syrus, where is Aeschinus?

Sy. Lo where he is there, he tarrieth for you
At home.

Ct. Oh!

Sy. What is the matter?

Ct. What it should be? By his means, Syrus,
I am now alive.

Sy. O merry man!

Ct. Who thought all his own concernments

The being in Love, and the offense has he taken upon himself.

S. He can do no more.

Ct. But who is that? the door creeks.

S. Tarry, tarry, he himself comes forth.

magnifice
Quicquam dicam, id virtus quin superet tua; itaque unam hanc rem

Nemini esse primarum artium magis principem.

S. O Ctesipho. O Sire, Aeschinus ubi est?

Sy. Ellum, te expectat
Domi.

Ct. Hem.

Sy. Quid est?

Ct. Quid sit? illius opera, Sire,

AESCHINUS. SANNIO. CTESIPHO. SYRUS. Aesch. WHere is that rogue?

Sa. Does he seek for me? Does he bring out any thing! I am undone,
I see nothing.

Aesch. O he very well: I am seeking for you; what is done, Ctesipho?
All is cock-sure, and therefore leave your sadness.

Cr. I indeed do easily
Let it pass, who have you to be my brother, Aeschinus, O mine own brother!

Rather to flatter you, then that I account it a kindness.

Aesch. Go to you fool,
As though we were not acquainted betwixt our selves, O Ctesipho; but this
grieves me,
That we had known it almost too late, and that it was come to that pass, that
if all men should desire,
They could not help you.

Ct. I was ashamed

Aesch. Alas, that is folly,

I pray God forbid these things.

Ct. I have done amiss.

Aesch. What says Sannio to us
Now at last?

Sy. He is now tame.

Aesch. I will go to the market, that I way
Dispatch this fellow; do you go in to her, C^pho.

Sa. Syrus, put him on.

Sy. Let us go.
For he is hasting into Cyprus.

Sa. Not so fast indeed: although I tarry also


Sy. It will be paid you, do not fear.

San. But speak that he may pay me all.

Sy. He will pay you all; do but hold your tongue and follow this way.

San. I will follow.

Ct. Ho,
Ho Syrus.

Sy. Anon, what is the matter?

Ct. I pray you heartily dispatch that very dishonest
Fellow, as soon as may be, lest if he be more provoked,
This may some way come to my fathers ear, and then I shall be undone for ever.

Sy.
And command that tables be spread for us, and other things be got ready. I
will presently,
As soon as the business is done, come home with some meat.

Ct. Do so, I pray thee, and seeing
It has fallen out well, let us have a merry day of this.

Act. II. Scen. IV.
AESCHINUS? SANNIO. CTESIPHO. SYRUS. Aesch. UBi ille sacrilegus?

Sa. Men' quaerit? number quidnam effert! occidi;
Nihil video.

Aesch. Ehem, optume, teipsum quaerito; quid sit, Ctesipho?
In tuto est omnis res, omit vero tristitiam tuam.

Ct. Ego illam facile vere
Omitto, qui quidem re habeam fratrem, Aeschine, o mi germane!

Quam quod habeam gratum facere existumes.

Aesch. Agc, inepte;
Quasi non noverimus nos inter nos, O Ctesipho; sed hoc mihi dolet,
Nos pene sero scisse, and in eum locum rediisse, ut si omnes cuperent tibi,
Nihil possent auxiliarier.

Ct. Pudebat.

Aesch. Ah, stultitia est istaec,

Deos quaeso, ut istaec prohibeant.

Ct. Peccavi.

Aesch. Quid ait tandem
Nobis Sannio?

Sy. Jam mitis est.

Aesch. Ego ibo ad sorum, ut hunc
Absolvam; tu intro ad eam Ctesipho:

Sa. Sire, insta.

Sy. Eamus.
Namque hic properat in Cyprum.

Sa. Ne tam quidem: quamvis etiam maneo


Sy. Reddetur, ne time.

Sa. Ut and omne reddat.

Sy. Omne reddet, tace modo ac sequere hac.

Sa. Sequar.

Ct. Heus,
Heus Sire.

Sy. Hem, quid est?

Ct. Obsecro hercle, hominem istum
Impurissimum quam primum absolvitote, ne, si magis irritatus Siet, aliqua ad
patrem hoc permanet, atque ego tunc perpetuo peririm.

C. Do you ask, what shall be done?
Well truly, I hope.

S. Now, Nurse, her pangs begin of her first child bearing.

C. Now you fear, as though you were never by at a woman's labor, or never bare
child your self.

S. Woe is me poor woman, I have no body, we are all alone, and Geta is not
here,


C. Truly he will be here by and by, for he never lets one day pass,
But he always comes.

S. He is the only remedy of my miseries.

C. As the case stands,
It could not be done better, then it is done, mistress: seeing a fault
Is committed, which principally pertains to him, such a one as he is, of such
a stock,


S. It is indeed so as you say,
I pray God, we may have him safe.

Act. III. Scen. II.
GETA. SOSTRATA. CANTHARA. G. Now the matter is, that if all men should lay
their heads together, and
Seek to remedy this evil, they could not afford any help,
Which evil has befallen both me, and my mistress, and my wistrisses daughter.
Woe is me, poor wretch, so many things on a sudden
Beset me round about, from which there is no getting out; violence, poverty,

O wicked kind! O ungodlie fellow!

So. Woe is me poor woman,
What is the matter that I see Geta so fearful, and making such haste?

G. Whom neither promise,
Ner oath, nor any pity has restrained, nor pulled back, nor
That her delivery was near, whom poor woman he had basely defloured by force.

S.

C. I pray you, Softrata,
Let us go nearer him.

G. A wretch that I am, I am scarce well in my wits,
I am so inflamed with auger. There is nothing that I more desire, then to meet
with
That whole family, that I may utter this anger upon them all, whilst this
grief
Is fresh, I should think I had punished them enough, if I were but revenged of
them.

And then Syrus the setter on; oh, what ways I would be revenged on him!
I would hoise him up on high by the middle, and first I would set him with his
heels upwards,
That he may sprinkle the way with his brains; I would ^ear out the eyes of the
young fellow himself, afterward I would break his neck.
I would rush upon the rest, I would drive them before me, I would knock them,
I would throw them under my feet. but do I forbear,


S. Let us call him back. Geta.

G. How now!
Whosoever you are, let me alone.

S. It is I Sostrata.

G. Where is she?
I am seeking for you, I am looking for you, you came very fitly to meet me,
Mistress.

S. What is the matter, why do you quake?

G. Woe is me.

S. Why do you make so much haste
My Geta? take breath.

G. Utterly.

S. What means that utterly?

G. We are undone;


S. I pray you, what is it?

G. Now.

S. What
Now, Geta?

G. Aeschinus.

S. What has he done then?

G. He is estranged from our family.

S. Alas, I am undone; wherefore?

G. He has begun to love another.

S. Woe is me poor woman.

G. Neither did he it closely: he himself took her away from the bawd openly.

S. Is this certain enough?

G. It is certain, I saw it my self with these eyes, Sostrata.

S. Aeschinus,
The life of us all, in whom all our hope and wealth did consist,
Who swore that he would never live one day without her, who said
That he would lay the child on his fathers lap, and so beseech him
That he might marry her.

G. Mistress, forbear weeping,

Or tell it to any body?

S. Whisht, whisht, man, are you well in your wits?
Do you think this is to be told anywhere?

G. Truly, I do not like it,
First now the matter it self shows that his mind is estranged from us.
Now if we tell this abroad, I know very well, he will deny it:

Never so much, it is not good to give her him to wife, seeing he is in love
with another;
Wherefore it is necessary to concea'e it by any means.

S. Ah, I will in no wise do it.

G. What do you do?

S. I will tell it.

G. Ah Sostrata, consider what you do.

S. The matter cannot be in worse case then now it is; first, she has no
portion,

For a maid; this only remains, if he deny it, I have the ring with me for a
witness,
Which he lost. Lastly, seeing I am privy to my self, that I am far from this
fault,
And that there was neither hire nor any thing betwixt, unbeseeming her or me,
Geta,
I will try what can be done.

G. What is that? I come nearer that you may better tell me.

S. Go you,
Hegio all this matter in order;
For he was an especial friend to our Similus, and respected us very much.

G. For indeed
No body else regards us.

So. Make haste, my Canthara, run,
Fetch the midwife, that we may not stay of her, when need is.

Act. III. Scen. II.

Circumvallant, unde emergi non potest; vis, egestas,

O genera sacrilega! O hominem impium!

So. Me miseram,
Quidnam est, quod sic video timidum and properantem Getam?

G. Quem neque fides,
Neque jusjurandum, neque ulla misericordia repressit, neque reflexit, neque
Quod partus instabat prope; cui miserae indigne vitium per vim obtulerat.

S.

C. Propius, obsecro,
Accedamus, Sostrata.

G. Ah, me miserum! vix sum compos animi,
Ita ardeo iracundia. Nihil est, quod malim, quam totam illam familiam
Dari mihi obviam, ut iram hanc in eos evomam omnes, dum aegritudo est haec
Recens, satis mihi id habeam supplicii, dum illos ulciscar modo.

Tum autem Syrum impulsorem, vah, quibus illum ulciscar modis!
Sublimem medium arriperem, and capite primum in terra statuerem,
Ut cerebro dispergat viam: adolescenti ipsi eriperem oculos, post haec
praecipitem darem:
Caeteros ruerem, agerem, raperem, tunderem, prosternerem; sed cesso


S. Revocemus Geta,

G. Hem,
Quisquis es, sine me.

S. Ego sum Sostrata.

G. Ubi ea est!
Teipsam quaerito, te expecto, oppido opportune te obtulisti mihi
Obviam hera.

S. Quid est? quid trepidas?

Ge. Hei mihi!

S. Quid festinas, mi
Geta? animum recipe.

G. Prorsus.

S. Quid istuc prorsus ergo est?

G. Periimus.


S. Obsecro te quid sit.

G. Jam.

S. Quid
Jam, Geta?

G. Aeschinus.

S. Quid is ergo?

G. Alienus est ab nostra familia.

S. Hem, perii, quare?

G. Amare occoepit aliam.

S. Vae miserae mihi!

G. Neque id occulte fert: ab lenone ipsus etipuit palam.

S. Satin' hoc certum?

G. Certum: hisce oculis egomet vidi, Sostrata.

S. Aeschinum,
Nostram vitam omnium, in quo nostrae spes opesque omnes sitae erant,
Qui sine hac jurabat se unum nunquam victurum diem, qui in sui
Gremio positurum puerum dicebat patris, ita obsecraturum,
Ut liceret hanc sibi uxorem ducere.

G. Hera, lachrymas mitte,

An narremus cuipiam?

S. Au, Au, mi homo, sanu'^' es?
An proferendum hoc tibi videtur esse usquam?

G. Mihi quidem non placet.
Jam primum, illum alieno animo a nobis esse res ipsa indicat.
Nunc si hoc palam proferemus, ille inficias ibit, sat scio,

Fateatur, cum amat aliam, non est utile hanc illi dare; quapropter,
Quoque pacto celato est opus.

S. Ah, minime gentium; non faci^m.

G. Quidagis?

S. Proferarr.

G. Hem, mea Sostrata, vide quam rem agas.

S. Pejore res loco non potest esse, quam in quo nunc sita est; primum indotata
est;

Non potest; hoc reliquum est, si inficias ibit, testis mecum est annulus
Quem ipse amiserat; postremo, quando ego conscia mihi sum, a me culpam esse
hanc procul,
Neque pretium, neque rem ullam intercessisse, illa aut me indignam, Geta,
Experiar.

G. Quid istuc? accedo, ut melius dicas.

S. Tu quantum potes,
Hegioni cognato hujus rem enarrato omnem ordine;
Nam is nostro Simulo fuit summus, and nos coluit maxim.

G. Nam he^cle
Alius nemo respicit nos.

So. Propera tu, mea Canthara, curre,
Obstetricem accerse, ut, cum opus sit, ne in mora nobis siet.

Act. III. Scen. III.
DEMEA. SYRUS. D. I Am quite undone, I have heard that my son Ctesipho was with
Aeschinus
In the taking the wench away. This evil remains to make me miserable, if he
can also dra^ him to lewdness,
Who is for any employment. Where should I seek him?
I think he is drawn away into a stew somewhither, I am sure that dishonest
fellow has persuaded him.
Syrus going; I shall know of him, where he is, and truly he
Is one of that crew? if he perceive that I am looking for him; the hang man
Will never tell me, I will not let him see that I desire that.

Sy. We have told the old man erewhile all the matter in order how it is,
I never saw one more merry.

D. O Jupiter, to see the folly of the man.

Sy. He commended


D. I am ready to burst asunder.

Sy. He told the money forthwith: he gave us half a piece besides toward the
charges;
That was laid out indeed as we would have it.

D. Ho, you should commit it to this fellow,
If you would have any thing well looked unto.

Sy. Ho, Demea, I did not see you.
How goes all?

D. How goes all? I cannot sufficien^lie wonder at your course of life.

Sy.
Fishes: let that great conger play in the water
A little while: it shall be garbaged when I come, I will not have it done
before.

D. That these
Lewd pranks should be done!

Sy. Truly they do not like me, and I often cry out,
Stephanio, see that these salt-meats be well watered.

D. O strange?

My son? woe is me poor man; me thinks I n^w see that day, when
He being in want shall run herehence somewhither to be a soldier;

Sy. O Demea,
That is wisdom, not only to see what is present, but also
To foresee those things which are to come.

D. What? is that singing wench now at the house?

Sy.

D. Whoo, will he have her at home?

Sy. I think so, he is so mad.

D. That these lewd pranks should be done!

Sy. The foolish lenity of his father, and his naughty
Gentleness.

D. Truly I am ashamed, and it irketh me that he is my brother.

Sy. There is too much difference betwixt you,
Demea, and I do not say this because you are here present, there is too too
much.
You, how great soever you are, are all wisdom; he is become otherwise,


D. Would I suffer him?
Or would not I have smelt it out full six months before he had attempted any
thing?

Sy. Do you tell me of your vigilant care?

D. Let him now be as he is, I pray you.

Sy. As a father would have his son to be, so he is.

D. What have you seen him to day?

Sy. Your
Son? (I will set him packing hence into the country) I think he is doing
something in the country a good while ago.

D.

Sy. Who my self went a gate-ward with him.

D. It is very well.
I was afraid lest he should have been hankering here.

Sy. And very angry too.

D. And why so?

Sy. He fell a chiding his brother at the market for this singing wench.

D. Say you so indeed?

Sy. Whoo, he lained nothing; for by chance as the money was paying,
The fellow came upon him at unawares, he began to cry out, Aeschinus,

Our pedigree?

D. O, I weep for joy.

Sy. Thou do not lose
This money, but thy life.

D. God bless him, I hope, he is like
His ancestors.

Sy. Whoo.

D. O Syrus, he is full of these documents.

Sy. He had one at home, of whom he might learn.

D. A great deal of pains is taken in it.

As into a looking glass, and to take to himself example by others. Do this.

Sy. Well indeed.

D. Avoid this.

Sy. Wisely.

D. This is for your commendation.

Sy. There is the cream of the matter.

D. This is for your discredit.

Sy. Very well.

D. And furthermore.

Sy. Truly I have no leisure now
To hearken to you; I have gotten fish according to my desire; I must have a
care

Not to do those things you spoke on erewhile; and, as far forth as I am able,
I instruct my fellow servants after that same manner; this is salt, this is
burnt,
This is not well washed; that is well, remember to do so again. I advise them
diligently
All I can as far as my skill reaches. Finally, I bid them, Demea,

To be done. I think these are fond things which we do. But what should one do?
As a man is, so you must humor him. Would you had any thing else?

D. I wish you have more wit
Given you.

Sy. Are you going hence into the country?

D. Straightway.

Sy. For what should you do here?


D. But I am going hence,
Seeing he for whose sake I came hither, is gone into the country: I care for
him
Only, he pertains to me. Seeing my brother will have it so, let him look to
That other. But who is yond, that I see a good way off? Is not this Hegio,
One of our kindred? if my sight fail me not, it is he verily. Ha, a man

Of such citizens now-a-daies; a downright honest and faithful man.
I know not of any harm that ever he did to the Commonwealth.
How glad am I when I see any remnants of this stock?
Ha, now I joy to live I will tarry for the man here,

DEMEA. SYRUS. D. DIsperii, Ctesiphonem audivi filium una affuisse in raptione
Cum Aeschino. Id misero restat mihi mali, si illum potest, qui^ alicui
Rei est, etiam ad nequitiam eum adducere. Ubi ego illum quaetam?
Credo abductum in ganeum, aliquo; persuasit ille impurus sat scio.
Syrum ire video; hinc scibo jam, ubi siet. Atque hercle hic
De grego illo est: si me senserit cum quaeritare, nunquam dicet
Carnusex; non ostendam id me velle.

Sy. Omnem rem modo seni, quo pacto haberet, enarramus ordine,
Nihil vidi quicquam laetius.

D. Proh Jupiter, hominis stultitiam!

Sy. Collaudavit


D. Disrumpor.

S. Argentum adnumeravit illi^o; dedit praeterea in sumptum dimidium
Minae. Id distributum sane ex sententia est.

D. Hem, huic mandes,
Si quid recte curatum velis.

S. Ehem, Demea, haud aspexeram
Te; quid agitur?

D. Quid agatur? vostram nequeo mirari satis rationem.

Sy.
Purga, Dromo: congrum istum maximum in aqua sinito luder^
Paulisper: ubi ego venero exossabitur; prius nolo.

D. Haeccine
Flagitia!

Sy. Mihi quidem non placent, and clamo saepe;
Salsamenta haec, Stephanio, fac macerentur pulchre.

D. Dii vestram fidem!

Guatum? vae misero mihi! videre videor jam diem illum, cum
Hinc egens profugiet aliquo militatum.

Sy. O Demea,
Istuc sapere est, non quod ante pedes modo est videre, sed etiam illa
Quae futura sunt, prospicere.

D. Quid? istaec jam penes vos Psaltria est?

Sy.

D. Eho, an domi est habiturus?

Sy. Credo, ut est dementia.

D. Haec^ine fieri flagitia?

Sy. Inepta lenitas patris, and facilitas
Prava.

D. Fra^ris me quidem pudet, pigetque.

Sy. Nimium inter vos,
Demea, ac non quia ades praesens dico hoc, pernimium;
Interest. Tu quantus, quantus, nihil nisi sapientia es: ille fit aliter,


D. Sinerem illum?
Aut non sex totis mensibus prius olfecissem, quam illc quicquam ceperit?

Sy. Vigilantiam tuam tu mihi narras?

D. Sic siet modo, ut nunc, quaeso.

Sy. Ut quisque suum vult esse, ita est.

D. Quid? eum vidistin' hodie.

Sy. Tuumne
Filium. (Abigam hinc rus,) jam dudum aliquid ruri agere arbitror.

D.

Sy. Quid egomet produxi.

D. Optume est,
Metui, ne haereret hic.

S. Atque iratum admodum.

D. Quid autem?

S. Adortus est jurgio fratrem apud forum de psaltria hac.

D. Ain'vero?

S. Vah, nihil reticuit; nam ut numerabatur forte argentum,
Intervenit homo de improviso, coepit clamare, Aeschine,

Genere nostro?

D. Oh, lacrymo gaudio.

S. No^ tu hoc
Argentum perdis, sed vitam tuam.

D. Salvus sit; spero, est similis
Majorum suorum.

S. Hui.

D. Sire, praeceptorum plenus est istorum
Ille.

S. Domi habuit, unde disceret.

D. Fit sedulo.

In speculum vitas omnium jubeo, atque ex aliis sumere
Exemplum sibi. Hoc facito.

S. Recte sane.

D. Hoc fugito.

Sy. Callide.

D. Hoc laudi est.

S. Istaec res est

D. Hoc vitio datur:

S. Probissime.

D. Porro autem.

S. Non hercle otium est nunc mihi

Corrumpantur cautio est. Nam id nobis tam flagitium est, quam illa
Demea, non facere vobis, quae modo dixti, and, quod queo,
Conservis ad eundem istunc praecipio modum: hoc salsum est, hoc adustum est,
Hoc lautum est parum: illud recte, iterum memento. Sedulo

In patinas, Demea, inspicere jubeo, and moneo quid sacto
Usus siet. Inepta haec esse nos quae facimus sentio. Verum, quid facias?
Ut homo est, ita morem geras. Numquid vis?

D. Mentem vobis meliorem
Dari.

Sy. In rus hinc abis?

D. Recta.

Sy. Number quid tu hic agas?


D. Ego vero hinc
Abeo, quando is, quamobrem huc veneram, rus abiit; illum curo
Unum, ille ad me attinet. Quando ita vult frater, de istoc
Ipse viderit. Sed quis illic est, procul quem video? Estne hic Hegio,
Tribu^lis noster? si satis cerno, is hercle est. Vah, homo

Magna nobis civium penuria est; homo antiqua virtute
Ac fide: Haud scio mali quid ortum ex hoc sit public.
Quam gaudeo, ubi hujus generis reliquias restare
Video? Vah, vivere etiam nunc lubet. Opperiar hominem


Act. III. Scen. IV.
HEGIO, GETA, DEMEA, PAMPHILA. H. OStrange: a base unworthy fact, Geta,
What is this thou tellest me?

G. It is so as I say.

Heg. That such an un-gentlemanly prank
Should be committed by one of that family? O Aeschinus,
Truly you have not learned this of your father.

D. Surely

Being but a stranger; his father makes nothing of it: woe is me,
I wish he were somewhere here by, and might hear these things.

Heg. Unless they do, what things its fit they should do, they shall not
carry it away thus.

Get. All our hope does rely upon you, Hegio.

That old man when he died, bequeathed us to you,
If you forsake us we are undone.

Heg. See you say not so;
Neither will I do it, neither do I think I can do it with any show of
honesty.

D. I will go to him; I bid you most heartily good morrow Hegio.

Heg. Demea.

D. But what is the matter?

Heg. Your elder son Aeschinus,
Whom you gave to your brother to be adopted, has neither done the part
Of an honest man nor a gentleman.

D. What is that?

Heg. Did you know Simulus a friend of ours,


D. what else?

Heg. He has defloured
His daughter being a maid.

D. Ha!

Heg. Tarry Demea, you have not yet heard
That which is the worst.

D. Is there any thing more yet?

Heg. Yes indeed more: for this is in some way to be born withal,
For the night, love, wine, and youth persuaded thereto;

Of his own accord to the maids mother, weeping, entreating, beseeching,
Promising, and swearing, that he would marry her and take her home to him.
It was unknown, it was kept silent, it was believed; the maid
Came to be great with child upon that deflourment: this is the tenth month.

That he may live withal, and forsake her.

D. Do you tell me these things for a certainty?

Heg. The maid's mother
Is ready to witness it, the maid her self, the matter it self; This Geta
Besides, as the condition of the servant is, no bad one,

The whole family: take him aside, tie him neck and heels, enquire the matter
out of him.

G. Nay indeed rack me, if it be not so done, Demea;
Lastly he will not himself deny it, let me have him face to face.

D. I am ashamed, neither do I know what to do, nor what to answer this man:

P. Juno Lucina,
Help me, save me, I beseech thee.

H. What now, I pray thee, is she crying five loaves a penny?

G. Yes Hegio.

Heg. She craveth your aid, Demea,
That she may obtain that by good will, which the law compels you to;
I pray God, that these things may first be done, as it becomes you:
Demea, I will defend her
To the utmost of my power, and him that is deceased.
He was my kinsman: we were brought up together being little ones
Even since we were children, we have been always together in the wars
And at home; we have endured a great deal of penury together.

I will lose my life rather then I will forsake them.
What answer do you give me?

D. I will talk with my brother, Hegio;
What advice he shall give me in this matter, that I will sollow.

Heg. But, Demea, see you consider this with your self,

Rich, fortunate, gallant,
So much the more it behooveth you to understand with an even mind
The things that are equal, if you will have your selves be accounted honest
men.

D. Come back again: all things shall be done, which it is fitting should be
done.

Heg. Geta, lead me the way to Sostrata.

D. These things are not done but by consent; I wish this might be only
The last prank, but that too much liberty
Will certainly come to some great mischef or other.
I will go, I will seek out my brother, that I may ease my stomach of these
things upon him.

Act. III. Scen. IV.
HEGIO, GETA, DEMEA, PAMPHILA. H. PRoh Dii immortales! facinus indignum, Geta,
Quid narras?

G. Sic est.

Heg. Ex illa familia
Tam illiberale facinus esse ortum? O Aeschine,
Pol haud paternum istuc dedisti.

Them. Videlicet,

Alieno: pater is nihili pen et; hei mihi,
Utinam hic prope adesset alicubi, atque audiret haec.

Heg. Nisi facient, quae illos aequum est, haud sic auferent.

Get. In te spes omnis, Hegio, nobis sita est:

Ille tibi moriens nos commendavit s^nex,
Si deseris tu, periimus.

Heg. Cave dixeris,
Neque faciam, neque me satis pie posse arbitror.

D. Adibo? jubeo salvere Hegionem plurimum.

Heg. Demea,

D. Quid autem?

Heg. Major filius tuus Aeschinus
Quem fratri adoptandum dedisti, neque boni
Neque liberalis functus officium est viri.

D. Quid istuc?

Heg. Nostrum amicum noras Simulum,


D. Quid ni?

H. Filiam ejus virginem
Vitiavit.

D. Hem!

H. Mane, nondum audisti, Demea,
Quod est gravissimum.

D. An quidquam etiam amplius?

H. Verq amplius; nam hoc quidem ferendum aliquo modo est,
Persuasit nox, amor, vinum, adolescentia;

Venit ipsus ultro, lachrymans, orans, obsecrans,
Fidem dans, jurans se illam ducturum domum.
Ignotum est, tacitum est, creditum est; virgo ex eo
Compressu gravida facta est; mensis hic decin us est.

Paravit, quicum vivat, illam and deserat.

D. Pro certon' tu istaec dicis?

H. Matter virginis
In medio est, ipsa virgo, res ips^; hic Geta
Praeterea, ut captus est servulorum, non malus*

Sustentat; hunc abduce, vinci, quaere rem.

G. Immo hercle extorque, nisi ita factum est, Demea,
Postremo nou negabit, coram ipsum cedo.

D. Pudet, neque quid agam, neque quid huic respondeam, scio.

P. Juno* Lucina,
Fer opem, serva me, obsecro.

Heg. Hem! numnam illa, quaeso, parturit?

G. Certe Hegio.

Heg. Illaec fidem nostram implorat, Demea,
Quod vos jus cogit, id voluntate ut impetret;
Haec primum ut fiant, deos quaeso, ut vobis decet:
Demea.
Summa vi defendam hanc, atque illum mortuum.
Cognatus mihi erat; una a pueris pa^vuli
Sumus educti: una semper militiae and domi
Fuimus; paupertatem una pertulimus gravem.

Animam relinquam potius quam illas deseram.
Quid mihi respondes?

D. Fratrem conveniam, Hegio,
Is quod mihi de hac re dederit consilium, id sequar.

Heg. Sed, Demea, hoc tu facito tecum animo cogites,

Potentes, dites, fortunati, nobiles,
Tam maxim vos aequo animo aequa noscere
Oportet, si vos vultis perhiberi probos.

D. Redito; fient, quae fieri aequum est, omnia.

Heg. Geta, duc me ad Sostratam.

D. Non, me indicente, haec fiunt; utinam hoc sit modo
Defunctum, verum nimia illa licentia
Profecto evadet in aliquod magnum malum.
Ibo, requiram fratrem, ut in eum haec evomam.

Act. III. Scen. V.
HEGIO. Heg. SOstrata, see you have a good heart, and see you clear up that
Daughter of yours
As well as you can; I will go talk with Mitio, if he be at the market,
And tell him orderly how the matter stands.
If it be, that he will do that which he ought to do,

Let him give me an answer, that I may know as soon as may be what I should do.

CTESPHO. SYRUS. Ct. DO you say my father is gone hence into the country?

S. Long ago.

Ct. I pray thee tell me truly:

Sy. He is at his farm-house. And I believe he is very hard now at some work.

Ct. I wish indeed, so it may be with his safety, that he may so weary himself,
As that he may not be able at all to rise out of his bed for these three days
together.

S.

Ct. Ey! for
I earnestly desire to spend all this day in merriment, as I have begun; and I
utterly dislike
That countrie-farm for no reason so much, as because it is neer-hand; but if
it were
Further off, the night would overtake him there, before he could return hither
Again. Now when he shall not see me there, he will come running hither again
by and by,

All the day long. What should I say?

S. Is no excuse come into your mind?

Ct. No nothing at all.

S. You are so much the worse. Have you no client, friend, or guest?

Ct. I have; what then?

S. Tell him, you attended on these.

Ct. Which attendance was not given;
This cannot be done.

S. It may.

Ct. On the day time. But if I tarry here all night,
Syrus?

S. Oh, how heartily I could wish it were a custom
To attend our friends also by night. But do you rest your self secure,
I know his pulse very well. When he is as hot as a roste, I make him
As quiet as a lamb.

Ct. How?

S. He delights to hear you commended,
I set you out as a little God to him, I tell him of all your good qualities.

Ct. Mine?

S.
Oh but see yonder for you?

Ct. What is the matter?

Sy. Here Is the man we talk of.

Ct. Is my father here?

S. It is just he.

Ct. Syrus, what shall we do?

Sy. Get you but in now,
I will look to it.

Ct. If he ask you any thing concerning me, say you saw me no where. Do you
hear?

Sy. Can you commaud your self to give over your prate?

Nulla al a causa tam male odi, nisi quia prope est; quod si abesset
Longius, prius nox oppressisset illic, quam huc reverti posset
Iterum. Nunc ubi me illic non videbit, jam huc recurret,

DEMEA. CTESIPHO. SYRUS. D. Verily I am an unfortunate man; first I can find
my brother no where
In all the world. And besides, as I was looking for him, saw a day tale man
Coming from my farm, he says my son is not in the country; and I know not
what to do.

Ct. Syrus,

S. What say you?

Ct. Is he looking for me?

S. Yes.

Ct. I am undone.

S. But be of good cheer.

D.
But that I think I am born to this thing, to suffer miseries.
I am the first that perceive our mishaps, I am the first that know all things,
And I am the first that carry the news of them; I am the only man that am
grieved at it, if any thing be done amiss.

S. I cannot but laugh as this man, he says he is the first that knows and
he alone is ignorant of all things.

D.

Ct. Syrus,
I pray thee have a care that he rush not himself quite in hither.

S. What can you hold your peace?
I will have a care.

Ct. Truly I will never to day adventure that thing with you:
For I will pen up my self with her in some close room: that is the safest
course.

S. Do it, yet I will set this man packing.

D. But lo where your roguish Syrus is?

Sy.
Verily I would faign know, how many masters I have: what a misery is this?

D. What is he yelping like a fox? what would he have? what say you you honest
man? Is my brother at home?

S. What do you say honest man to me, with a mischief? verily I am an undone
man.

D. What aileth you?

S. Ctesipho has quite killed me poor man, and that singing wench
With buffeting.

D. Ha, what story you tell?

Sy. Oh, do you see how he has cut my lip?

D. Why so?

S. He says, she was bought by persuasion.

D. Did not you say
You went agateward with him lately into the country from hence?

S. So I did, but he came afterward
Like a madman, he made no spare of any thing. Should not he have been ashamed
to beat


D. I commend thee Ctesipho, thou do follow thy fathers steps; go thy way, I
take thee to be a man.

S. Do you commend him? he will hold his hands hereafter, if he be wise.

D. Valiantly done.

S. Very valiantly, because he has overcome a poor woman, and me
A poor slave, that durst not strike again: Whoo, it was very valiantly done.

D.
But is my brother within?

S. He is not.

D. I muse, where I may seek him.

S. I know where he is,
But I will not tell you to day.

D. Ha, what say you?

S. So.

D. I will be sure to beat out thy brains now.

S. But I know not the name
Of that man, but I know the place where he is.

D. Tell me the place then.

S.

D. Why should 1
But know it?

S. Go straight along this street to the upper end; when you come there,
There is a down-hill toward the lower end; haste your self this way;
afterward there is
A chapel on this hand, there is a by-corner hard by.

D. What one?

S. There where
There is also a great wild fig tree; do you know it?

D. I know it.

S. Go on this way.


S. True indeed, ah,
Do you not perceive that I am a man? I am mistaken; ^ome back again to the
porch,
Indeed you will go a great deal nearer this way, and it is not so ill to hit.
Do you know this rich man Cratinus's house?

D. I know it.

S. You are gone past it,
Go on the left hand straight along this street; when you come at Diana's
temple,

There is a mil-house, and over against it there is a joyners shop; there he is.

D. What does he there?

S. He has put out some tables to be made with holm feer,
Whereon you may drink in the sunshine.

D. Very well indeed: but do I m^ke no more haste to go to him?

S. Get you gone for sooth; I will set you on work to day, as you deserve, you
old dotard.
Aeschinus loytereth tediously; the dinner is spoiled;
Ctesipho is in love up to the ears: I will now look to my self.
For I will now go, and take every thing that is the most tooth some,
And tippling off the pots by little and little, I will draw this day to an end.

DEMEA. CTESIPHO. SYRUS. D. NAe ego homo sum infaelix; primum fratrem nusquam
invenio
Gentium. Praeterea autem dum illum quaero, a villa mercenarium
Vidi; is filium negat esse ruri: nec quid agam scio.

Ct. Sire,

Sy. Quid ais?

Ct. Men' quaerit?

S. Verum.

Ct. Perii.

S. Quin tu animo bono es.

D.
Nisi me credo huic esse natum rei, ferendis miseriis.
Primus sentio mala nostra, primus rescisco omnia,
Primus porro obnuncio: aegre solus, si quid fit, fero.

S. Rideo hunc, primum ait se scire, is solus nescit omnia.

D.

Ct. Sire,
Obsecro, vide ne ille huc prorsus se irruat.

S. Etiam taces?
Ego cavebo.

Ct. Nunquam hercle ego hodie istuc committam tibi.
Nam me in cellam aliquam cum illa concludam; id tutissimum est.

S. Age, tamen ego hunc amovebo.

D. Sed eccum sceleratum Syrum!

S.
Scire equidem volo, quot mihi sint domini: quae est haec miseria!

D. Quid ille gannit? quid vult? quid ais bone vir? est frater domii?

S. Quid, malum, bone vir, mihi narras? equidem perii.

D. Quid tibi est?

S. Ctesipho me pugnis miserum, and istam psaltriam
Usque occidit.

D. Hem, quid narras?

S. Hem, vides, ut discidit labrum.

D. Quamobr^m?

S. Me impulsore hanc emptam esse ait.

D. Non tu eum
Rus hinc modo produxe aiebas?

S. Factum; verum venit post
Insaniens, nihil pepercit; non puduisse verberare hominem


D. Laudo, Ctesipho, patrissas; abi, virum te judico.

S. Laudasne? ille continebit posthac, si sapiet, manus.

D. Fortiter.

S. Perquam, quia miseram mulierem, and me servolum
Qui referire non audebam, vicit; hui, perfortiter.

D.
Sed estne frater intus?

S. Non est.

D. Ubi illum quaeram, cogito.

S. Scio ubi sit,
Verum hodie nunquam monstrabo.

D. Hem, quid ais?

S. Ita.

D. Diminuetur tibi quidem jam cerebrum.

S. At nomen nescio
Illius hominis; sed locum novi ubi sit.

D. Dic ergo locum.

S.

D. Quid ni
Noverim?

S. Praeterito hac recta platea sursum; ubi eo veneris,
Clivos deorsum versus est, hac te praecipitato; postea est ad hanc
Manum sacellum, ibi angiportum propter est.

D. Quodnam?

S. Illic ubi
Etiam caprificus magna est; nostin'?

D. Novi.

S. Ha^ pergito^

D.

S. Verum hercle, vah,
Censen' hominem me esse? erravi; in porticum rursum redi,
Sane hac multo propius ibis, and minor est erratio.
Scin' Cratini hujus ditis aedes?

D. Scio.

S. Ubi eas praeterieris,
Ad finistram hac recta platea: ubi ad Dianae veneris,

Est pistrilla, and ex adverso fabrica, ibi est.

D. Quid ibi facit?

S. Lectulos in sole ilignis pedibus faciundos dedit,
Ubi potetis vos.

D. Been sane; sed cesso ad eum pergere?

S. I sane, ego te exercebo hodie, ut dignus es, silicernium;
Aeschinus odiose cessat: prandium corrumpitur:
Ctesipho autem in amore est totus: ego jam prospiciam mihi.
Nam jam adibo, atque unumquodque quod quidem erit bellissimu^,
Carpam, and cyathos sorbillans paulatim, hunc producam diem

MITIO. HEGIO. M. I Find nothing in this matter, Hegio, why I should be so
much c^mended,
I do but my duty, I amend what we have done a^^sse.
Unless you think me to be one of those men, who think thus
That they have an injury done them, if they have done one themselves
wilfully, they themselves complain,
And cry whore first, because I have not done so, you give me thanks.

Heg. Ah no, I never thought you to be otherwise then you are:
But, I pray you, Mitio, go with me to the maids mother,
And tell the woman your self those very same things which you told me;
That this suspicion is for his brother and the singing wench.

M.

Heg. You do well:
For you will both ease her heart, who wastes away with grief
And misery, and you will discharge the duty of an honest man as you are; but
if you be minded otherwise,
I my self will tell her, what you have told me.

M. Nay, I will go.

H. You do well.
All people, with whom the world goes not very well, are more supitious; I
know not how,

They always think they are neglected for their infirmity
Wherefore it is more pacifying for you to excuse your self to her face to face.

M. You say well, and truly.

H. Follow me in then this way.

M. Yes.

Act. IV. Scen. III.
MITIO. HEGIO. M. EGo in hac re nihil reperio, quam ob rem lauder tantopere,
Hegio. Meum officium facio, quod peccatum a nobis est, corrigo.
Nisi si me in illo credidisti esse homi^u^ numero, qui ita putant
Sibi fieri injuriam, ultro siquam fecere, ipsi expostulant;
Et ultro accusant: id quia non est a me factum, agis gratias.

H. Ah, minime; nunquam te aliter atque es, in animu^ induxi meu^.
Sed quaeso, ut una mecum ad matrem virginis eas, Mitio.
Atque istaec eadem, quae mihi dixti, tute dicas mulieri:
Suspicione^ hanc propter fratre^ ejus esse, and illam psalteriam.

M.

H. Been facis:
Nam and illi animum jam revelabis, quae dolor ac miseria
Tabescit, and tuo officio fueris functus; sed si aliter putas,
Egomet narrabo quae mihi dixti.

M. Imo ego ibo.

H. Been facis.
Omnes, quibus res sunt minus secundae, magis sunt, nescio quomodo,

Propter suam impotentiam, se semper credunt negligi.
Quapropter te ipsum purgare ipsi coram, placabilius est.

M. Et certe, and veru^ dicis.

H. Sequere me, ego hac intro.

M. Maxim.

Act. IV. Scen. IV.
AESCHINUS. Aesch. I Am vexed in my mind, that this so great a mischief should
be objected to me on a suddoin,
That I cannot be certain what do with my self, nor what course to take.
My limbs are enfeebled with fear, my mind is astonished through affrightment,
No counsel at all can stand in my heart.

Has now light upon me, and that not without cause. Sostrata thinks.
That I bought this singing wench for my self: the old woman discovered that to
me;
For as she by chance was sent hence to the midwife, as soon as I saw her,
I went presently to her, I ask her how Pamphila did, whether she was near her
labor,
Aeschinus,
You have now deceived us long enough; your promise has hitherto
Sufficiently frustrated us: Alas, quoth I, what is the matter, I pray you?
You may fare well, you may have her that likes you. I perceived presently,
that they suspected that;
Yet nevertheless I withheld my self, lest I should utter any thing
concerning my brother to that blab,

To be uttered. Well, I let it pass, it may come to pass, that it may not come
out any way.
This is the very thing I fear, lest they believe it, there are so many
likeliehoods concur.
I my self took her away by force; I my self paid the money; she is brought
away
Home to me: moreover I confess these things were done through my default,
that I told not this thing

Hitherto I have been negligent; now Aeschinus henceforth bestir thy self.
Now this is to be done first and foremost; I will go to them, to clear my
self, I will come to the door.
I am undone, I always tremble every bone of me, when I begin to knock at
this door, poor man that I am.
Ho ho, it is I Aeschinus, some of you open the door quickly.


Act. IV. Scen. IV.
AESCHINUS. Aesch. DIscrucior animi, hoccine de improviso mali mihi objici
tantum,
Ut neque quid de me faciam, neque quid agam, certum siet.
Membra metu debilia sunt; animus timore obstupuit,
Pectore consistere nihil consilii quidquam potest.

Suspicio deem incidit, neque ea immerito Sostrata credit
Mihi me psalteriam hanc emisse; id anus mihi judicium fecit;
Nam ut hinc forte ea ad obstetricem erat missa, ubi vidi eam,
Illico accedo, rogito Pamphila quid agat, jam partus adsiet,
Aeschine,
Satis diu dedisti verba nobis, satis adhuc tua nos
Frustrata est sides; hem, quid istuc, obsecro, inquam, est?
Valeas, habeas illam quae placet. Sensi illico id illas suspicari:
Sed me reprehendi tamen, ne quid de fratre garrulae illi faverem,

Est opus efferri. Age, mitto, fieri potis est, uti ne qua exeat.
Ipsum id metuo ne credant, tot concurrunt verisimilia.
Egomet rapui; ipse egomet solvi argentum; ad me abducta est
Domum: haec adeo mea culpa fateor fieri, non me hanc rem patri

Cessatum usque adhuc est; nunc por^o, Aeschine, expergiscere.
Nunc hoc est primum; ad illas ibo, ut purgem me, accedam ad fores,
Perii, horresco semper, ubi pulsare hasce occipio fores, miser.
Heus, heus, Aeschinus ego sum, aperite aliquis actutum ostium.


Act. IV. Scen. V.
MITIO. AECHINUS. M. SOstrata, do as you said. I will go talk with Aeschinus,
That he may know how these things are carried. But who knocked at the door?

Aes. Truly it is my father, I am undone.

M. Aeschinus.

Aesc. What business has be here?

M. Did you knock at this door? he says never a word. Why do I not play upon a
little while?

Do you make me no answer?

Aesch. Truly I did not knock at this door, that I know of.

M. Say you so? for I wondered what business you had here.
He blusheth; All is well.

Aes. I pray you tell me, father,
What business had you here?

M. I had no business truly.

To be a dayes-man for him here.

Aes. What?

M. I will tell you.
There are certain poor women dwell here,
I suppose, and I am sure, you do not know them;
For it is not long since they flitted hither.

Aes. What more then?

M.

Aesc. Go on.

M. This maid is fatherless.
This friend of mine is the next akin to her,
The Laws constrain him to marry her.

Aes. I am undone.

M. What is the matter?

Aesch. Nothing; well, go on.

M. He is come to carry her away with him,
For he dwells at Miletum.

Aesc. Ah, to have the maid away with him?

M.

Aesch. As far as Miletum I pray you?

M. Yes.

Aesc. I am sick at the heart.
What say the women?

M. What do you think they say? for they can say nothing.
The mother feigned that there is a child born by another man,
I cannot tell who, for she does not name him:
And that he is the first, and therefore that she ought not to be given to this
man.

Aesch.

M. No.

Aes. I beseech you, no? father, shall he have her away hence?

M. Why should he not have her away?

Aes. It is harshly done of you,
And unmercifully; and if it be lawful for me, father,
To speak more plainly, ungentlemanly.

M.

Aes. Ask you me? what heart at length do you think
Will that poor man have, that kept her company before,
(Who forlorn man, I know not well, whether he love her dearly now or no)
When being by he shall see her taken from him by force before his face,
As to be had away out of his sight? O father, it is an unworthy action.

M.
To whom, when was she married? who is the principal contriver of these matters?
Why has he married another man's sweetheart?

Aesch. Ought such a great maid
To sit at home, waiting till her kinsman should come
From thence hither? these things, father,


M. You cox-comb, should I plead against him,
For whom I came to be an advocate? But, Aeschinus, what are these things
Concerning us? or what have we to do with them? let us go hence; what is the
matter?
Why do you weep?

Aesch. Father, I beseech you, hear me.

M. Aeschinus,

Are a greater care to me.

Aesch. I wish you may love me as one that deserves, your love,
Whilst you live, father, as it heartily grieveth me, that I should have taken
This fault upon me, and I am ashamed of my self for your sake.

M. I believe it indeed, for I know your good nature:

In what city I pray you do you think you live?
You have defloured a maid, which it was not lawful for you to touch.
Now that is a very great offense, yet of humane frailty.
Others and good men have done so oftentimes. But since this thing fell out,
tell me,

What might be done? what way it might be done? if you your self were ashamed
to Iell me,
Which way should I know? whilst you are at a stand about these things the ten
months are gone about:
You have betrayed your self, and her poor woman, and your son, as far as was
in your power.
What? did you think that God would do this for you whilst you were asleep?

I would not have you be careless of other things af^tr the same manner.
Have a good heart, you shall marry her.

Aesch. Ha!

M. Have a good heart, I say.

Aesc. Father, I pray you, do you now befool me?

M. I be fool you? wherefore?

Aes. I know not, because I so greatly covet this to be true, I am therefore
the more afraid.


Aesch. What? shall I now marry a wife?

M. Now.

Aes. Just now?

M. Just now, as fast as you can.

Aesch. I wish I were dead, father, if I do not now love you more then these
eyes of mine own.

M. What? better then her?

Aes. As well.

M. Very kindly.

Aesch. What? where is
That Milesian?

M. He is gone, he is dashed, he has taken ship. But why do you linger?

Aes.
Grant your request, because you are the virtuous man far away.

M. I will go in, that such things as are needful may be got ready; do you as
I told you,
If you be wise.

Aesch. What business is this? is this to be a father?
Or is this this to be a son? If he were my brother or fellow-companion, how
could be

To be hugd in ones bosom? Therefore has he laid on me a great care
By his kindness toward me, lest peradventure I should do anything
Unawares, which he would not have me to do. Now I know it, I will take heed.
But do I make no haste
To get in, lest I be a cause of delay to my own marriage!

Act. IV. Scen. V.
MITIO. AESCHINUS. M. ITa ut dixisti, Sostrata, facite: ego Aeschinum conveniam,
Ut quo modo acta haec sunt, sciat. Sed quis ostium hoc pulsavit?

Aesch. Pater hercle est, perii:

M. Aeschine.

Aesch. Quid huic h^c negotii?

M. Tune has pepulisti fores? tacet. Cur non ludo hunc aliquantisper?

Nihil me respondes?

Aesch. Non equidem istas, quod sciam.

M. Ita? nam mirabar, quid hic negotii esset tibi.
Erubuit, salva res est.

Aesch. Dic sodes, pater,
Tibi vero quid istic res est?

M. Nihil mihi quidem.

Huc advocatum sibi.

Aesc. Quid?

M. Ego dicam tibi,
Habitant hic quaedam mulieres pauperculae,
Ut opinor, has non nosse re, and certe scio;
Neque enim diu huc commigrarunt.

Aesch. Quid tum postea?

M.

Aesc. Perge.

M. Haec virgo orba est patre.
Hic meus amicus illi genere est proximus.
Huic Leges cogunt nubere hanc.

Aesc. Perii.

M. Quid est?

Aesch. Nihil; recte, perge.

M. Is venit, ut secum avehat,
Nam habitat Mileti.

Aesch. Hem, virginem ut secum avehat?

M.

Aes. Miletum usque obsecro?

M. Ita.

Aes. Animo male est.
Quid ipsae aiunt?

M. Quid istas censes? nihil enim.
Commenta matter est esse ex alio viro,
Nescio quo, puerum natum, neque eum nominat,
Priorem esse illum, non oportere huic dari.

Aesch.

M. Non.

Aes. Obsecro, non? an illam hinc abducet pater?

M. Quidni illam abducat?

Aes. Factum a vobis duriter,
Immisericorditerque; atque etiam si est, pater,
Dicendum magis aperte, illiberaliter.

M.

Aes. Rogas me? quid illi tandem creditis
Fore animi misero, qui cum illa consuevit prius,
(Qui infelix, haud scio, an illam misere nunc amat,)
Cum hanc sibi videbit praesens praesenti eripi,
Abduci ab oculis? facinus indignum pater.

M.
Cui, quando nupsit? author his rebus quis est?
Cur duxit alienam?

Aesch. An sedere oportuit
Domi virginem tam grandem, dum cognatus huc
Illinc veniret exspectantem? haec, mi pater,


M. Ridiculum, advorsumne illum causam dicerem,
Cui veneram advocatus? Sed quid ista, Aeschine,
Nostra? aut quid nobis cum illis? abeamus: quid est?
Quid lachrymas?

Aesch. Pater, obsecro, ausculta.

M. Aeschine,

Quae agis curae sunt mihi.

Aesch. Ita velim me promerentem ames,
Dum vivas, mi pater, ut me hoc delictum admisisse
In me id mihi vehementer dolet; and me tui pudet.

M. Credo hercle, nam ingenium novi tuum

In qua civitate tandem te arbitrare vivere?
Virginem vitiasti, quam te jus non fuerat tangere.
Jam id peccatum primu^ magnum, at humanu^ tamen.
Fecere item alii saepe boni. At postquam id evenit, cedo,

Quid fieret, qua fieret? Si te ipsum mihi puduit dicere,
Qua resciscerem? haec dum dubitas, menses abie^e december:
Prodidisti te, and illam miseram, and natum, quod quidem in te fuit.
Quid? credebas dormienti haec tibi confecturos Deos?

Nolo c^^erarum rerum te socordem eodem modo.
Bono animo es, duces urorem hanc.

Aesch. Hem.

M. Bono animo es, inquam.

Aesch. Pater, obsecro, number ludis tu nunc me?

M. Ego te? quamobrem?

Aesch. Nescio, quia tam misere hoc esse cupio verum, ideo vereor magis.

M.

Aesch. Quid? jamne uxorem ducam?

M. Jam.

Aesch. Jam?

M. Jam quantum potest.

Aesch. Dii me, pater, omnes oderint, ni magis te, quam oculos nunc ego amo
meos.

M. Quid? quam illam?

Aes. Aeque.

M. Perbenign^.

Aesch. Quid? ille ubi est
Milesius?

M. Abiit, periit, navem ascendit; sed cur cessas?

Aes.
Quo vir melior multo es, quam ego, obtemperaturos magis.

M. Ego eo intro, ut quae opus sunt, parentut; tu fac ut dixi,
Si sapis.

Aes. Quid hoc negotii? hoc est patrem esse?
Authoc est filium esse? si frater aut sodalis esset, qui magis

Gestandus in sinu est? Hem! itaque adeo magnam mihi
Injecit sua commoditate curam, ne forte imprudens
Faciam, quod nolit; sciens cavebo. Sed cesso ire
Intro, ne mora meis nuptiis egomet siem!

bring on thee
Some mischief with that thy showing me the way, Syrus.
I have gone creeping quite over all the town, to the gate, to the pool,
Whither not? neither was there any carpenter's shop there, nor did a^i^ man
say

At his house till he come home again.

MITIO. DEMEA. M. I will go and tell them, there is no delay in us.

D. But lo where he is; I have been looking for you a great while, Mitio.

M. What is the matter?

D. I bring you other great lewd pranks
Of that honest young man.

M. But lo.

D. New pranks,


M. Enough, now.

D. Alas, you know not what a man he is.

M. I do know.

D. Ah you fool, you dream that I speak of the singing-wench:
This offense is done against a maid that is a citizen.

M. I know it.

D. Ho, do you know it, and suffer it?

M. What should I do but suffer it?

D. Tell me.
Do not you cry out? are you not out of your wits?

M. No, I had rather you were.

D.

M. God bless him and send him good luck.

D. The maid has nothing.

M. I heard as much.

D. And must he marry one without a portion?

M. Ye.

D. What will now become of it?

M. That forsooth which the matter affords.
The maid shall be brought over from thence hither.

D. O Jupiter!
Must it be done on that fashion?

M. What should I do else?

D.
Certainly it is a wise man's part to make as though it did.

M. But I have already
Betrothed the maid to him, the matter is concluded, the marriage is to be made.
I have taken away all fear; these things are rather belonging to a man.

D. But,
Does this doing please you, Mitio?

M. No; if I could tell how

Man's life is so, as when you play at tables,
If that fall not, which is most needful to be cast,
You must amend that by skill, which fell out by chance.

D. You an amender! for sooth twenty pounds are lost by your skill

As soon as may be, if not for a piece of money, yet for nothing.

M. Neither is she to be sold, nor indeed does he desire to sell her.

D. What will you do then?

M. She shall be at my house.

D. O strange!
A whore, and a good-wife of the house under one roof?

M.

D. Do you think you are well in your wits?

M. Truly I think so.

D. I swear, as far as I understand your folly,
I think you will do this, that you may have one to sing with you.

M. Why not?

D. And the new married woman shall learn these same things?

M. Yes forsooth.

D. And you shall dance among them leading the ring.

M. Very well.


D. Woe is me.
Are you not ashamed of these things?

M. But now, Demea, forbear
That peevishness of yours, and make your self blithe and buxome at your son's
marriage.
I will go talk with these, and come hither again afterward.

D. O Jupiter!
Is this a life fit to be led? are these manners to be used? is this madness
to be shown?

A costly house is to be maintained; a young man is undone by riot;
An old man is turned dotard. Salus her self if she should desire it,
Cannot at all be able to preserve this family from ruin.

Act. IV. Scen. VII.
MITIO. DEMEA. M. IBo, illis dicam, nullam esse in nobis moram.

D. Sed eccum ipsum; te jam dudum quaero, Mitio.

D. Fero alia flagitia ad te ingentia
Boni illius adolescentis.

M. Ecce autem.

D. Nova,


M. Ohe, jam.

D. Ah, nescis qui vir sier.

M. Scio.

D. Ah stulte, tu de psaltria me somnias
Agere: hoc peccatum in virginem est civem.

M. Scio.

D. Eho, scis and patere?

M. Quid ni patiar?

D. Dic mihi,
Non clamas? non infanis?

M. Non, malim quidem.

D.

M. Dii been vertant.

D. Virgo nihil habet.

M. Audivi.

D. Et ducenda indotata est?

M. S ilicet.

D. Quid nunc futurum est?

M. Id enim quod res ipsa fert.
Illinc huc transferetur virgo.

D. O Jupiter!
Istoccine pacto oportet?

M. Quid faciam amplius?

D.
Simulare certe est hominis.

M. Quin jam virginem
Despondi, res composita est, fiunt nuptiae.
Dempsi metum omnem; haec magis sunt hominis.

D. Caeterum,
Placet tibi factum, Mitio?

M. Non; si queam

Ita vita est hominum, quafi cum ludas tesseris,
Si illud, quod maxim opus est jactu, non cadit,
Illud quod cecidit forte, id art ut corrigas.

D. Corrector! nempe tua art viginti minae

Aliquo abjicienda est, si non pretio, gratis.

M. Neque est, neque illam sa^^e studet vendere.

D. Quid igitur facies?

M. Domi erit.

D. Proh Deu n fidem!
Meretrix, and matter familias una in domo?

M.

D. Sanum te credis esse?

M. Equidem arbitror.

D. Ita me Dii ament, ut video tuam ego ineptiam,
Facturum credo, ut habeas, quicum cantites.

M. Cur non?

D. Et nova nupta eadem haec discet?

M. Scilicet.

D. Tu inter eas restim ductans saltabis.

M. Probe.


D. Hei mihi.
Non te haec pudent?

M. Jam vero omit, Demea,
Tuam istanc iracundiam: atque ira, uti decet;
Hilarem ac lubentem fac te in nati nuptiis.
Ego hos conveniam, post huc redeo.

D. O Iuppiter!

Uxor sine dote veniet: intus psaltria est:
Domus sumptuosa: adolescens luxu praeditus:
Senex delirans. Ipsa, si cupiat, Salus,
Servare prorsus non potest hanc familiam.

And performed your office daintily.

It is my pleasure to walk out abroad hither.

D. See and observe


S. But behold here is
Our old master. What is done? why are you sad?

D. Oh you rogue!

S. So, good man wise-aker, are you now wasting your words here?

D. If you were my servant.

S. Truly, Demea, you would have been a rich-man,
And you would have bettered your estate.

D. I would have made thee to be


Sy. Why so? what have I done?

D. Do tho^ ask?
In the very bustle, and in a very great offense,
Which is scarcely ended well enough, you have been tippling, you rogue,
As it were in matter well done.

S. Truly I wish I had not come forth.

DROMO. SYRUS. DEMEA. Dro. HO Syrus, Ctesipho entreats you to come back again.

S. Go your way.

D. Why does this fellow mention Ctesipho?

S. Nothing.

D. Ho, you hangman,
Is Ctesipho within?

S. He is not.

D. Why does this fellow name him?

S. There is another certain little parasite.
(...). Do you know him?

D. I will know by and by.

S. What do you? whither go you?

D. Let me alone.

S. Do not, I say.

D. Will you not hold off your hands, you whipped rogue?
Or had you rather have your brains dashed out?

S. He is gone.
Truly I think him no fit fellow-reveller,
Especially for Ctesipho. What should I do now?

Into a corner, and sleep out this wine. I will do so.

DROMO. SYRVS. DEMEA. Dr. HEus Sire, rogat te Ctesipho, ut redeas.

S. Abi.

D. Quid Ctesiphonem hic narrat?

S. Nihil.

D. Eho carnifex,
Est Ctesipho intus?

S. Non est.

D. Cur hic nominat?

S. Est alius quidam parasitaster parvolus.


D. Jam scibo.

S. Quid agis? quo abis?

D. Mitte me.

S. Noli, inquam.

D. Non manum abstines, mastigia?
An tibi mavis cerebrum dispergi hic?

S. Abiit.
Aedipol commessatorem haud sane commodum,
Praesertim Ctesiphoni. Quid ego nunc agam?
Nisi dum hae silescunt turbae, interea in angulum
Aliquo abeam, atque edormiscam hoc vini. Sic agam.

MITIO. DEMEA. M. WE have made things ready, so as you said, Sostrata,
When you please. Who is that that knocked so hard at my door?

D. Woe is me, what should I do? what should I cry out on, or complain?
O heaven! O earth! O Neptune's seas!

M. See thee yonder:
(...). He has known all the matter; he now cries out on it, without doubt.
He is disposed to brabble, I must help.

D. Lohere he is,
The common undoer of his children.

M. At the length repress your anger, and come again to your self.

D. I have repressed it, I am come again to my self, I forbear all illlanguage.

Moreover it was of your own making, that you should not look after my son,
Nor I after yours; answer me this.

M. It was so, I do not deny it.

D. Why is he tippling at your house? why do you entertain my son?
Why do you buy him a sweetheart, Mitio? is it not fit that I should have

Seeing I do not look to your son, do not you look to mine.

M. You do not say right.

D. No?

M. For indeed this is an old-saying,
That all things are common amongst friends.

D. Wittily said, this proverb is but now sprung up at last.

M. Demea;
First and foremost if this vex you, what charges your sons
Are at, I pray you consider with your self these things:
You brought up them two according to your estate;
Because you thought your means would be sufficient for them both:
And then you believed forsooth that I would marry:
Keep on that same old wont;
Save, seek, spare, see you leave them as much
As possibly may be, do you get that credit to your self,
Let them make use of my means, which have happened beyond your hope.

Account that for a vantage; if you would, Demea
Rightly consider all these things in your mind,
You would rid both me and your self, and them also of trouble.

D. I forbear the estate, I speak of their haunt.

M. Tarry;
Demea,
Many signs in a man, by which a guess may be easily made;
As you may often times say, when two do the same thing,
This man may do this thing without controlment, that man may not:
Not because the thing is unlike, but the party that does it:

As we would have it. I see they are witty and understand, and stand inaw
When need serves, they love one another; one may know their gentlemanlie
Nature and disposition; you may reclaim them any day
When you will Yet nevertheless you may be afraid lest they should be
Demea,
We grow more s^ilful in all other matters through age.
This only one fault old age brings upon men,
We are all more diligent about an estate then needs:
Which age will sufficient lie whet them on to.

D. Mitio let not those good reasons of yours,


M. Hold your tongue,
It shall not be done, let those things pass; be advised by me to day:
Look blithe on it.

D. Verily, so the time requires,
I must do it; but I will be gone hence with my son into the country
By peep of day.

M. Nay, I think you may go in the night.


D. And I will also hurrie
That singing-wench hence with me thither.

M. You shall do a mighty matter.
By this means you shall be sure to tie your son there.
Only look to it, that you keep her.

D. I will see to that;
And for her, I will make her that she shall be full of ifle^, smoke, and
mill-dust,

I will cause her to gather stubble at the very noon-time of the day;
I will make her as dry and black as a coal is.

M. I like this well.
Now you seem to me to have some wit in you.

D. And indeed, I will constrain my son,
Then although he be very loath, that he shall lie with her.

M.

D. Do you jear me? you are happy, that are of that mind,
I perceive.

M. Ab do you go on?

D. Now you give over.

M. Go your way in then, and in what thing it is requisite,
In that thing let us spend this day merrily.

D. Hei mihi, quid faciam? quid clamem, aut quera^?
O coelum! O terra! O maria Neptuni!

M. Hem tibi,

Paratae lites, succurrendum est.

D. Eccum adest,
Communis corruptela suorum libe^um.

M. Tandem reprime iracundiam, atque ad te redi.

D. Repressi, redii, mitto maledicta omnia.

Ex te adeo ortum est, ne tu curares meum,
Neve ego tuum; responde.

M. Factum est, non nego.

D. Cur nunc apud tepotat? cur recipis meum?
Cur emis amicam, Mitio? number quid minus

Quando ego tuum non curo, ne cura meum.

M. Non aequum dicis.

D. Nor?

M. Nam verus verbum hoc quidem est,
Communia esse amicorum inter se omnia.

D. Facere, nunc demum istaec nata oration est.

M. Ausculta paucis, nisi molestum est, Demea;
Principio si id te mordet, sumptum filii
Quem faciunt, quaeso, facito haec tecum cogites:
Tu illos duos pro re tollebas tua,
Quod satis putabas tua ambobus fore;
Et me tum uxorem credidisti scilicet ducturum;
Eandem illam rationem antiquam obtine;
Conserva, quaere, parce, fac quam plurimum
Illis relinquas, gloriam tu istanc tibi obtine;
Mea, quae praeter spem evenere, utantur, sine.

Id de lucro putato esse: omnia haec si voles,
In animo vere cogitare, Demea,
Et mihi and tibi and illis dempseris molestiam.

D. Mitto rem: consuetudinem ipsorum.

M. Mane:
Demea,
Signa insunt, ex quibus, conjectura facile fit,
Duo cum idem faciunt, saepe ut possis dicere,
Hoc licet impune facere huic, illi non licet:
Non quod dissimilis res sit, sed quod is qui facit;

Ita ut volumus. Video eos sapere, intelligere, in loco
Vereri, inter se amare; scire est liberum
Ingenium atque animum; quovis illos tu die
Reducas. At enim metuas, ne ab resint tamen
Demea,
Ad omnia alia aetate sapimus rectius;
Solum unum hoc vitium senectus affert hominibus,
Attentiores sumus ad rem omnes quam sat est:
Quod aetas illos sat acuet.

D. Ne nimium
Mitio,
Et tuus iste animus aequus subvortat.

M. Tace,
Non fiet, mitte istaec; da te hodie mihi:
Exporge frontem.

D. Scilicet, ita tempus fert.
Faciendum est; caeterum rus cum filio


M. Imo, de nocte censeo.
Hodie modo hilarem te fac.

D. Et istam psaltriam
Una illuc mecum hinc abstraham.

M. Pugnaveris.
Eo pacto prorsum illic alligaris filium.
Modo facito, ut illam serves.

D. Ego istoc videro;

Coquendo sit, faxo; and molendo; praeter haec
Meridie ipso faciam, ut stipulam colligat:
Tam excoctam reddam atque atram, quam ^arbo est.

M. Placet.
Nunc mihi videris sapere.

D. Atque equidem filium


M. Hoc est sapere.

D. Derides? fortunatus, qui istoc animo sies,
Ego sentio.

M. Ah pergisne?

D. Jam jam desino.

M. I ergo intro, and cui rei opus est,
Ei rei hilarem hunc sumamus diem.

Act. V. Scen. III.
DEMEA. D NEver was there any man so well advised with himself how to live,
But things, age, and practice, may always afford him some new thing,
May teach him somewhat, so that you do not know those things which you think
you do know,
And after you have made trial you reject those things which you made most
choice of:

The race of my life being now almost run out; wherefore have I done it? I have
found in very deed
That nothing is better for a man then gentleness and clemency.
That that is true, it is an easy thing for any man that will to know by me
and my brother.
He always led his life at ease, in eating good cheer,

He lived to himself, he bestowed cost on himself; all men spoke well of him,
they love him.
I that countrie-low^, that am testie, dumpish, niggardlie, feirce-look't,
pinching,
Married a wife; what misery therein have I seen? I had sons born me,
This was another care; and moreover whilst I take care to do for them

Now my years being spent, I reap this benefit from them for my labor,
Their hatred: that other enjoys all the commodities a father should do
without any pains.
They love him; they fly from me; they trust him with all their secrets;
They like him; they are both with him; I am forsaken.

Forsooth, thus has he made his with a little cost, those that I have brought
up
With a great deal of labor; I get all the misery, and he enjoys
The pleasure. Well, well, let us now try what I can do contrary to these
things,
To speak fair and deal lovinglie, seeing he provokes me to it;

If that be done by giving, and following them in their wills, I will not be
inferior to any man.
There will be a want. That makes nothing to me, who am the elder brother.

Id esse veunm; ex me atque ex fratre, cuivis facile est noscere.

Illum amant, me fugitant: illi credunt consilia sua;
Illum diligunt: apud illum sunt ambo: ego desertus sum.

Scilicet, ita eos eductos meo labor maxumo, hic fecit suos
Paulo sumptu; miseriam omnem ego capio, hic potitur

S. All well.

D. That is very well; I have just now for the first point added these three
things
Contrary to my nature. O my, how do you? how goes all?
You show your self to be an honest servant, and I will do you a good turn,

To day to be a man of much worth;

That has a care of his master, as I see you have, Geta;
And I will be ready with all my heart to do you a good turn,
If occasion be offered. I Will try how courteous I can be,
And it goes on well.

to make the marriage
Too Ceremonious, they spend the whole day in getting things ready.

D. Aeschinus, how goes all?

Aesch. O my father, was you here?

D. Truly thine own father indeed, both in affection and nature,

Why do you not fetch your wife home?

Aesch. I desire it, but this thing hinders me,
The musician, and they that sing the wedding-song.

D. What will you
Stand to hearken to this old man?

Aesch. What?

D. Let these things alone,
The company, the marriage-song, the lights, the musicians,

As soon as can be, fetch over this way, make but one house;
Bring over both the mother and all the family to our house.

Aesch. Content,
Most pleasant father.

D. O brave, now I am called a pleasant man.
My brother's house shall have a thorow-fair, he will bring a company

I the pleasant man begin to grow into favor; bid Babylo just now
To tell out twenty pounds.
Syrus, do you make no haste to go and do it?

Sy. What then?

D. Pull it down.
Do you go, and bring them over.

G. A blessing on you, Demea,

To have it dispatched for our family.

D. I think they deserve it.
What say you?

Aesch. I think so.

D. It is a great deal better,
Then for that childbed woman to be now brought this way along the street
Being so green as she is.

Aesch. Truly my father, I never saw any thing better done.
Mitio comes out of doors.

D. Tuus hercle vero, and animo, and natura, pater,

Aesch. Cupio: verum hoc mihi morae est;
Tibicina, and qui Hymenaeum cantent.

D. Eho; vin'tu

Aesch. Quid?

D. Missa haec face.
Turbam, Hymenaeum, lampadas, tibicinas,

Quantum potest, hac transfer, unam fac familiam;
Traduce and matrem and familiam omnem ad nos.

Aesch. Placet,

Fratris aedes fient perviae; turbam domum

Ego lepidus ineo gratiam; jube nunc jam

MITIO. DEMEA. AESCHINUS. M. Does my brother command this? where is he? Do you
command thus, Demea?

D. I indeed command both in this matter, and in all other things,
That we may make this family as much as can be one with ours,
That we may respect, help, and join it to us.

Aes. I pray you, let it be so, father.

M.

D Yea indeed it becomes us to do so.
First, she is the mother of his wife.

M. What then?

D. An honest and modest woman.

M. So they say.

D. Somewhat ancient in years.

M. I know it.

D. She is long since past having children by reason of her years,
Neither is there any body that regards her, she is a lonely woman.

M. What does he mean to do?

D

M. What me to marry?

D. You.

M. Me?

D. You I say.

M. You play the fool.

D. If you be a man, get him to do it.

Aes. My father.

M. What, you ass, do you hearken to him?

D. You had as good do nothing.
It cannot be done otherwise.

M. You d^a^.

Ae. Let me over-intreat you,


M Are you mad? take him away.

D. Come on, give way,
I pray you, to your son.

M. Are you sufficiently in your wit? Should I n^w at length
Become a new-married man in the threescore and fifth year of my age, and marry
A decr^pit old woman? Do ye advise me to that?

Aes. Do it:
I have promised them.

M. And have you promised them? Be liberal of your own s^wcie boy.

D.

M. As if this were not
The greatest of all.

D. Give him his asking.

Aes. Do not think much at it.

D. Do it, promise.

M. Do not you let me alone?

Ae^. No, except I may over-intreat you.

M. Truly this is a kind of forcement.

D. Come on, do freely, Mitio.

M. Although this seem to me to (...) naught, foolish,
Absurd, and far from my course of life, yet if you


Ae^. You do well;
I love you accordingly as you deserve.

D. But what? what should say? seeing this is done,
Which I desire. What is now behind^? Hegio is n^x^ kinsman to these
Of af^nitie to us, a poor-man; it bec^mmeth us to do him
Some good turn.

M. To do what?

D. Here is a little close
Near the city, which you rent forth; let us give it him,
That he may enjoy it.

M. And but a little one?

D. If it were a great one,
We must do it; he is as a father to her, he is a good man, it is well bestowed.
Lastly, I do not make any word mine, Mitio, which you spoke
Erewhile well and wisely. It is a common fault of us all,

We ought to avoid this blemish,
It was truly said, and it ought to be done in good earnest.

M. What is that? it shall be bestowed on him indeed, seeing this man will have
it so.

Aesch. My father.

D. Now you are mine own full brother both in soul


M. I am glad of it.

D. I convince him with his own argument.

D. You are a thriftie honest man.
Therefore in my opinion I verily judge it meet,
That Syrus should be made free to day.

M. That fellow free? for what doing?

D. Many good things.

S. O our Demea,

Those your sons for you continually ever since they were children.
I have taught them, and advised, and always given them all the good
instructions
That ever I was able.

D. The de^d bears mention; and indeed moreover,
These things, to play the caterer, to bring you a where with a viol,


S. O merry man!

D. Lastly, this man was a helper to day
In buying that singing-wench, he looked to it, it is fit that we d^e him a
good turn,
Other servants will be the better; to conclude, he will have it so done.

M. Will you
Have this done.

Aes. I desire so.

M. Seeing you will have this thing; h^ Syrus,


S. You do well; I do thank you all,
And especially you Demea, besides.

D. I am glad of it.

Aes. And so am I.

S. I believe it* I wish this joy
May be long-lasting; O that I might see my wife Phrygia
Set at liberty with me.

D. A very good woman indeed.

S. And truly


D. Indeed and in earnest, seeing she was the first woman
That gave him suck, there is no doubt, but itis reason she should be set free.

M. For that matter?

D. For that; lastly, take as much money of me
As she is worth.

S. I pray God grant you all things that you desire Demea.

M. Syrus, you have made a good days work of it to day.

D. And if you, Mitio,
Besides will do your duty, and give him a little aforehand,
That he may make use of, he will give it you again
Shortly.

M. Not this much worth

Aes. He is an honest thrifite man.

Sy. I will repay you
Truly. Do but give it me.

Aes. Do, father.

M. I will consider hereafter.

D.

S. O the best man in all the world.

Aes. O most pleasant father.

M. What is the matter? what thing has so suddenly changed your manners?
O Demea, what wastful spending? what sudden largio^ snesse is this?

D. I will tell you. That I might show you that, for which they account you
A gentle and pleasant man; that that is not done by a serious course of ^fe,

And giving them their wills, and freely bestowing on them, Mitio. And now
Aeschinus, if for that matter my life be so hateful to you,
Because I let you nothave your mind altogether in all those unjust things,
I set the cart on wheels; waste, throw away,

What you do not so well see because of your youth,
What you more earnestly desire, and little consider,
That I should find fault with and redress these things,
And humor you when occasion serves; lo I am here that will do it for you.

Aes.
To be done. But what shall be done concerning my brother?

D. I permit him,
Let him have her; let him make an end (of his wenching) in (having) her.

Aes. That is well said. Clap hands for joy.

The Argument or Plot of Hecyra, by Caius Sulpicius Apollinaris.
PAmphilius took Philumena to wife,
Whom he before time defloured, not knowing who she was,
And he had given her ring, which he had plucked off by force,
To his sweetheart Bacchis a very whore,
Imbrus: he lay not with her after she was married:
Her mother took her home to her self, being great with child,
As if she were sickly. Pamphilus returns,
He finds there is a child born; he conceals it, yet would not
Take his wife again. The father lays blame on his love
(...). With Bacchis: as Bacchis was clearing her self, Myrrhina
The mother of the maid that was defloured, by chance owneth the ring:
Pamphilus takes his wife again with a son.
Hecyrae Argumentum, Q. Sulpitio Appollinari Authore.
UXorem duxit Pamphilus Philumenam,
Cui quondam ignorans virgini vitium obtulit,
Ejusque per vim quem detraxerat annulum,
Dederat amicae Bacchidi meretriculae.

Hanc matter utero gravidam, ne id sciat socrus,
Ut aegram ad se transfert. Revertitur Pamphilus,
Deprehendit partum: celat: uxorem tamen
Recipere noluit. Pater incusat Bacchidis
Bacchis, annulum
Matter vitiatae forte agnoscit Myrrhina.
Uxorem recipit Pamphilus cum filio.
The Prologue.
HEcyra is the name of this Comedy; when this was first
Acted, a strange fault and misery befell it.
The people being wholly intent upon a rope dancer,
Had so busied their mind, that it could neither be looked at, nor taken
notice on.

And he that writ this was not therefore unwilling
To show it again, that he might sell it again.
You have known other Comedies of his; now I pray you approve this.
I come as an humble suitor to you in a Prologues weed*

Being old, which privilege I had being younger,
Who have caused new Comedies that were hissed off the stage, to come into
request again,
Lest Poetry together with the Poet should decay.
In those Comedies of Caecilius which I first learned new,

And because I knew that Players fortune on the stage was dubious,
I undertook to my self a certain labor in an uncertain hope;
I began to act the same, that I might diligently learn of him
Other new ones, left I should cause him to forsake his st^die.

They pleased; thus I restored the Poet to his former state,
Who was now almost discouraged by the injury of his adversaries,
From study and pains, and the Art of Po^trie.
But if I had slighted his writing at present, and

That he might rather sit still and do nothing, then employ himself,
I could easily have discouraged him, from writing any other.
Now for my sake consider equitably what I request.
I bring you Hecyra again, which I could never act

Your wisdom will mitigate that misfortune,
If it shall be aiding to our industry.
When I first began to act it, a show of them that went to fistie cuffs,
And the looking upon a rope-dancer befell at the same place:

Caused that I went forth before the time.
I began to use my old custom in a new Comedy,
That I might make tr^^l, I bring it in again;
In the first Act I pleased you, when in the mean time a report comes,

They make a hurly burly, they cry out, and sight for their places;
In the mean time I could not keep my place.
Now there is no stir, all is quisht and silent.
I have now time granted me to Act, you have a power

Do not suffer Poetry through your default,
To come to the use of few; see that your authority
May be favorable and assisting to my authority.
If I never greedily set a price of my Art,

To serve your profit, as much as may be:
Suffer me to prevail, that naughty men may not laugh at him,
Being wickedly circumvented, who has committed his labors
To my defense, and himself to your protection.

That others may have pleasure to write, and it may be profitable for m^
To learn new Comedies hereafter, bought at my own price.
Prologus.
HEcyra est nomen huic fabulae: haec cum data est
Nova, novum intervenit vitium and calamitas,
Ut neque spectari, neque cognosci potuerit;
Ita populus studio stupidus in funambulo
Animum occuparat; nunc haec plane est pernova:
Et is qui scripsit hanc ob eam rem noluit
Iterum refer, ut iterum possit vendere.
Alias cognostis ejus, quaeso ^^^c hanc noscite.
Orator ad vos venio ornatu prologi;
Sinete exorator sim, eodem ut jure uti senem
Liceat, quo jure sum usus adolescentior,
Novas qui exactas feci ut inveterascerent,
Ne cum Poeta scriptura evanesceret:
In his quas primu^ Caecilii didici novas,
Pa^tim sum earum exactus, par^im vix steti;
Quia sciebam dubiam esse fortunam scenicam,
Spe incerta certum mi^i laborem sustuli;
Easdem agere caepi, ut ab eodem alias discerem
Novas studiose, ne illum ab studio abducerem,
Perfeci, ut spectarentur; ubi sunt cognitae,
Placitae sunt, ita Poetam restitui in locum,
Prope jam remotum injuria adve^sarium
Ab studio, atque a labor, atque ar^e musi^a.
Quod si scripturam sprevissem in praesentia, and
In deterrendo voluissem operam sumere,
Ut in otio esse^, potius quam in negotio:
Deterruissem faci^e, ne alias scriberet.
Nunc quid petam, mea causa, aequo animo attendite,
Hecyram ad vos refero, quam mihi per silentium
Nunquam agere licitum est, ita eam oppressit calamitas;
Eam calamitatem vestra intelligentia
Sedabit, si erit adjutrix nostrae industriae.
Cum primum eam agere caepi, pugilum gloria,
Funambuli eodem accessit spectatio;

Fe^ere ut ante tempus exirem fo^as;
Vetere in nova caepi uti consuetudine,
In experiundo ut essem, refe^o denuo;
Primo actu placeo, cum interea ru^^or venit,

Tumultuantur, clamant pugnant de loco:
Ego interea meum ^on potui tutari locum.
Nunc turba nulla est, otium and silentium est,
Agendi tempus mihi datum est; vobis datur

Nolite sinere per vos artem Musicam
Recidere ad paucos; facite ut vestra autoritas
Meae autoritati sautrix adjutrixque sit.
Si nunquam avare statui pretium arti meae,

Quam maxume servire vestris commodis;
Sinite impetrare me, qui in tutelem meam
Studium suum, and se in vestram commisit fidem,
Ne eum circumventum inique iniqui irrideant.

Ut lubeat scribere aliis, mihique ut discere
Novas expediat posthac, pretio emptas meo.

PHILOTIS. SYRA. Ph. Truly Syra you can find but very few lovers,
Which prove constant to their paramours.
Even this Pamphilus how often did he swear to Bacchis,
And how devoutlie, that any body might easily believe him,
That whilst she lived he would never marry,
Lo he is married.

S. Therefore because of that I seriously
Both warn and exhort you, that you would not take pi^ty of any man,
But pillage, maim, rend in pieces, whomsoever you get.

Ph. Will you that I should have no b^dy exempted?

S. No body,
For be sure that no one of them comes to you,
But he so prepares himself, that by his flattering speeches
He may satisfy his pleasure at a very small rate.
Will not you I pray you on the other hand seek to beguil these?

Ph. Yet indeed it is unreasonable to carry alike toward all.

S. ^ut is it unreasonable to be revenged of our enemies?
Or what way they catch you, that they should be caught by the same?
Ah me poor woman, why have not I
That youth and beauty, or you this resolution?

Act. I. Scen. I.
PHILOTIS. SYRA. Ph. PEr Pol quam paucos reperias meretricibus
Fidelis evenire amatores, Syra.
Vel hic Pamphilus jurabat quoties Bacchidi,
Q^a^n sancte, uti quivis facile possit credere,

En duxit.

S. Ergo propterea te sedulo
Et moneo and hortor, ne cujusquam te miserea,
Quin spolies, mutiles, laceres, quemquem nacta sis.

Ph. Utin' eximium neminem ha^eam?

S. Neminem.

Quin ita paret sese, abs te ut ^landitiis suis
Quam minimo pretio suam voluptatem expleat.
H^scine tu amabo non cont^ a insidiabere?

Ph. Tamen Pol eandem injurium est esse omnibus.

S.
Aut qua via te captent illi, eadem ipsos capi?
E^eu me miseram, cur non aut istaec mihi
Aetas and forma est, aut tibi haec sententia?

Act. I. S^en. II.
PARMENO. PHILOTIS. SYRA. Pa. IF the old man ask for me, tell him I am newly
gone
To the haven to enquire of Pamphilus' s coming.
Do you hear what I say Syra? if he ask for me, be sure that
You tell him then; if he shall not ask, do not tell him,
That I may make use of this excuse, yet never made another time,
But do not I see Philotis? whence does she come?
Philotis, God save you heartily.

Ph. O Parmeno, God save you.

S. In troth God save you Parm^no.

Pa. And you Syra in good sooth,
Tell me Philotis, where have you solac^d your self so long a time?

Ph. Truly I have not solaced my self, who went
Hence to Corinth with a most unkind soldier;
I poor woman endured him there two whole years together.

Par. Truly Philotis I think you had often a good mind
To see Ath^ns again, and that you reperted
Of the course you had taken.

Ph. It cannot be said,
How desirous I was to come hither again, and get away from the soldier,
And see you here, that according to our old accustomed manner
I might freely feast it amongst you.
For there I might not speak, but by appointment,
What words might please him.

Par. I do not think
The soldier did hand somelie bound your discourse.

Ph. But what business is this? what stories did Bacchis
Tell me erewhile within here? a thing which I never thought
Would come to pass, that he could frame his mind
To have a wife, whilst she is alive.

Pa^^ What to have one?

Ph. Oh you, has he (...) o^e?

Par. He has one, but I fear this marriage will not hold.

Ph. God gra^^ it may not, if it be for Ba^chis good.
But how should I believe that it is so? tell me Parmeno.

Par. There is no need it should be spoken; forbear
To ask me this.

P^. Verily for that reason (I could forbear) that it may not come abroad;
I swear I do not ask you therefore that
I may disclose this thing, but that I may silentlie rejoice with my self.

Par. You shall never speak so handsomelie, as that I will trust
My back with you.

P^* Ah Parmeno, do not say so,
As though you had not rather tell me this,
Then I who ask, would know.

Par. She speaks the truth.
And this is a very great fault that I have; if you will promise me on your
word
That you will say nothing of it, I will tell you.

Ph. You come to your old by as:
I plight you my faith: speak.

Par. Hearken.

Ph. I am wholly intent upon you.

Par As Pa^ philus
Loved this Ba^^his very dearly, so then especially
When his father began to entreat him to take a wife,
And to tell him these things, which are common to all fathers,
That he was an old man, and that he was only son,
And that he desired he might be his succor in his old age.

Was more earnestly urgent upon him, he put him into a quandarie,
Whether he should rather yield to shame or love.
At the last by importuning and wearying the old man brought it about:
He handfasted this next neighbors daughter to him.
Pamphilus all the while,
Till he was just upon the marriage: after he saw
It was provided, and that there was no delay made, but he must marry:
He then at length took it so heavilie, that I believe
Bacchis her self, if she had been there, would then have pitied him.

That he might talk with me, (he would say) O Parmeno,
I am undone, what have I done? into what mischief have I plunged my self?
I shall never be able to endure this, Parmeno, I am undone poor man.

Ph. But God confound thee Laches with that thy wearying him.

Par.
He had nothing to do with the maid that first night:
The night following, he did as little to her.

Ph. What say you? could a young man lie in a bed with a maid,
Being soundly tipled, and so as to refrain himself from her?


Par. I believe it seems so to you; for no body comes to you,
Except he have a desire to you; he had married her against his will.

Ph. What fell out afterward?

Par. Truly within a very few days
After Pamphilus drew me alone out of the doors,

And that he, before he had married her and brought her home,
Did hope he should be able to abide the marriage.
But, Parmeno (says he) it is neither honest for me, nor good for the maid,
That she, whom I concluded, I should not be able to keep any longer

But that I should deliver her again undesteined, as I received her from her
friends.

Ph. You tell me of the honest and chaste nature of Pamphilus.

Par. I think it very unfitting for me to publish this;
And that she should be restored to her father, against whom you can a Redge no
fault,

When she knows this, that she cannot abide with me.

Ph. What did he in the mean time? did he go to Bacch is?

Par. Every day.
But, as it fell out, after she saw him estranged from her,
She presently became a great deal more froward, and more malapert.

Ph.

Par. And that matter did most of all
Separate him from her, after he sufficiently understood himself,
And her, and this woman which was at home,
Considering both their behaviors by way of comparison:
This woman, as becomes one that is of u good nature,

Of her husband, and concealed his taunting words.
Hereupon his affection being partly engaged by the pity
Of his wife, and partly overcome by the injuries of this Bacchis,
By little and little stole away from Bacchis, and set his love

In the mean time an old man a kinsman of these
Died in Imbrus, the inheritance fell to these by law:
His father packt Pamphilus being in love thither against his will;
He left his wife here with his mother; for the old man


Ph. What instabilitie has the marriage hitherto?

Par. You shall now hear; at first indeed for a few days
The women agreed very well amongst themselves:
In the mean time she began wonderfully to distaste Sostrata,

Any complaining.

Ph. What then?

Par. If at any time she came to her,
To talk with her, she presently got out of her sight,
She would not see her: at last when she could not abide it,
She made as though she was sent for by her mother to a sacrifice; she went
away.

They then alleged I know not, what excuse; she bids again.
No body sent her back. After she had sent for her somewhat often,
They pretend that the woman was sick. Our mistress presently
Goes to her to visit her: no body gave her admission. When the old man
understood this;

And talked with Philumena's father out of hand.
I do not yet know what they did amongst themselves;
But indeed I am sollicitous, what this may come to.
You know all the matter; I will go on this journie, whither I began.

Ph.
That I would come and speak with him.

Par. God speed you
In what you do.

Ph. Fare you well.

Par. And fare you well heartily, Philotis.

PARMENO. PHILOTIS. SYRA. Pa. SEnex si quaeret me, modo isse dicito
Ad portum percontatum adventum Pamphili.
Audin quid dicam Syra? si quaeret me, uti
Tum dicas; si non quaeret, nullus dixeris,

Sed videon' ego Philotin? unde haec advenit?
Philot is, salve multum.

Ph. O salve Parmeno.

S. Salve mecaster Parmeno.

Pa. Et tu aedipol Syra.
Dic mihi Philoti, ubi te oblectasti tam diu?

Ph.
Corinthum hinc sum profecta inhumanissimo;
Biennium ibi perpetuum misera illum tuli.

Par. Aedipol te desiderium Athenarum arbitror
Philotium cepisse saepe, and te tuum


Ph. Non dici potest,
Quam cupida eram huc redeundi, abeundi a milite,
Vosque hic videndi, antiqua ut con^uetudine
Agitarem inter vos libere convivium;
Nam illic haud licebat, nisi praefinito loqui


Par. Haud opinor commode
Finem orationi statuisse militem.

Ph. Sed quid hoc negotii est? modo quae narrav^^ mihi
Hic intus Bacchis? quod ego nunquam credidi
Fore, ut ille hac viva posset animum inducere


Pa. Habere autem?

Ph. Eho tu, an non habet?

Pa. Habet, sed firmae hae vereor ut sint nuptiae.

Ph. Ita Dii Deaeque faxint, si in rem est Bacchidis.
Sed qui istuc credam ita esse? dic mihi, Parmeno.

Pa. Non opus est prolato; hoc percontatier


Ph. Nempe ea causa, ut ne id fiat palam;
Ita me Dii been ament, haud propterea te rogo, ut
Hoc proferam, sed tacita ut mecum gaudeam.

Par* Nunquam tam dices commode, ut tergum meum
Tuam in fidem committam.

Ph. Ah, noli, Parmeno,

Quam ego quae percontor scire.

Pa. Vera haec praedicat,
Etillud mihi vitium est maximum. Simihi fidem
Das te tacituram, dicam.

Ph. Ad ingenium redis:
Fidem do: loquere.

Par. Ausculta.

Ph. Istic sum.

Par. Hanc Bacchidem
Pamphilus,
Cum pater uxorem ut ducat orare occipit,
Et haec, communia omnium quae sunt patrum,
Se senem esse dicece, illum autem esse unicum,
Praesi^um velle se senectuti suae.

Pater instat, secit animi ut incertus foret,
Pudorin' anne amori obsequeretur magis.
Tundendo atque odio denique effecit senex:
Despondit ei gnatam hujus vicini proxumi.
Pamphilo neutiquam grave,
Donec jam in ipsis nuptiis: postquam videt
Paratas, nec moram ullam, quin ducat, dari:
Ibi demum ita aeg^e tulit, ut ipsam Bacchidem,
Si adesset, credo ibi ejus commiseresceret.

Ut conloqui mecum una posset; Parmeno,
Perii. Quid ego egi? in quod ego me conjeci malum?
Non potero far hoc, Parmeno; perii miser.

Ph. At te Dii Deaeque perduint cum istoc odio, Laches.

Par.
Nocte illa prima virginem non attigit:
Quae consequu^a est nox, eam nihilo magis.

Ph. Quid aid? cum virgin una adolescens cubuerit
Plus potus, se illa abstinere ut potuerit?


Par. Credo ita videri tibi: nam nemo ad te venit,
Nisi cupiens tui: ille invitus illam duxerat.

Ph. Quid deinde fit?

Par, Diebus sane pauculis
Post Pamphilus me solum subduxit for as,

Seque antequam eam uxorem duxisset domum,
Sperasse eas tolerare posse nuptias:
Sed quam decreverim me non posse diutius
Habere, eam ludibrio habere, Parmeno,

Neque honestum mihi, neque utile ipsi virgini est.

Ph. Pium and pudicum ingenium narras Pamphili.

Par. Hoc ego profe^re incommodum mihi esse arbitror,
Reddi patri autem, cui tu nihil dicas vitii,
Superbum est: sed illam sp^ro, ubi hoc cognoverit,
Non posse se mecum esse, abituram denique.

Ph. Quid interea? ibatne ad Bacchidem?

Par. Quotidie:
Sed, ut fit, postquam hunc alienum ab se videt,
Maligna multo and magis procax facta illico est.

Ph.

Par. Atque ea res multo maxume
Disjunxit illum ab illa, postquam and ipse sese
Et illam, and hanc quae domi erat cognovit satis,
Ad exemplum ambarum mores earum aestimans;
Haec, ita uti liberali esse ingenio decet,

Viri omnes far, and tegere contumelias.
Hic animus, partim uro: is mesericordia
D^v^^ctus, partim victus hujus injutia,
Paulatim elapsus est Bacchide, atque huic transtulit

Interea in Imbro moritur cognatus senex
Horum, ad hos redibat lege haereditas:
Eo amantem in^itum Pamphilum extrudit pater;
Reliquit cum matre hic uxorem; nam senex


Ph. Quid adhuc habent infirmitatis nuptiae?

Par. Nunc audies; primum dies complusculos
Been conveniebat sane inter ^as:
Interim mitis modis odisse cepit Sostratam,

Nunquam.

Ph. Quid igitur?

Par. Si quando ad eam accesserat
Confabulatum, fugere e conspectu illico,
Videre nolle: denique ubi non quivit pati,
Simulat se a matre accersi ad rem divinam: abiit.

Dixere causam tunc nescio quam; iterum jubet.
Nemo remisit, postquam accersivit saepius,
Aegram esse simulant mulierem. Nostra illico
It visere ad eam: admisit nemo. Hoc ubi senex rescivit,

Patrem continuo conveni^ Philumenae.
Quid egerint inter se nondum etiam scio,
Nisi sane ^urae est, quorsum eventurum hoc siet.
Habes omnem re^, pergam, quo cep^, hoc iter.

Ph.
Me esse ill^ conventuram.

Par. Dii vortant been
Quod agas.

Ph. Vale.

Par. Et tu been vale, Philo^i.

LACHES. SOSTRATA. La. O Strange, what a sort of women is this? what
conspiracy is this?
That all women should alike affect the same things, and be unwilling to all
things?
Nor shall you find any that has swerved any whit from others disposition;
And therefore thus with one consent all mothers in law have hated their
daughters in law.

Me thinks they are all instructed to naughtiness in the same school:
And I am sure, if any be, this woman is the mistress of that school.

So. O wretched woman that I am, who do not know now, wherefore I am accused.

La. Ha,
Do not you know?

So. No, I swear my Laches;


La. God forbid those evils.

So. And you shall know after a while that I am wrongfully accused by you.

La. I know
That you are wrongfully accused. Can any thing be spoken as you deserve for
those pranks,
Who do disgrace me and your self, and our family, and breed your son sorrow?
And besides you make our marriage-kindred of friends to become our enemies;

You alone are started up, to put these things out of order by your impudence.

So. What I?

Lach. You, I say woman, who judge me to be a stone altogether, and not a man.
Do you think, because I use to be often in the country, that I know not,
How every one of you leads his life here?

Therefore because as you shall be to me at home, so I shall be by report
abroad.
Truly I heard long ago that Philumena hated you,
And it is no marvail; and if she had not done it, it had been a greater
marvail:
But I did not believe withal, that she hated his whole house;

But see how undeservedly this grief befalls me through you, Sostrata;
I went hence to dwell in the country, giving way to you, and striving to get
something,
That my means might be able to bear your cost and idleness,
Not sparing my pains, above what was meet for me, and my age.


So. Truly it came not to pass by my means, nor through my default.

La. Yes most of all.
You was here alone. Sostrata, all the fault lies upon you.
You should have looked to what was here, seeing I acquitted you of all other
ears.
Are you not ashamed being an old-woman to fall out with a girl?


So. Truly I do not say so, my Laches.

La. I am glad, I swear, for my son's sake. For as for you, I know very well,
No damage can be done you by your doing amiss.

So. How do you know, my husband, whether she made as though she hated me for
that cause,
That she might be more with her mother?

La. What say you? is it not^ token sufficient,


So. No, for they then said she was very faint-sick, and so I was not admitted
to her.

La. I think that your manners are rather a sickness to her then a^ other
thing.
And good cause why; for there is none of you, but would have her son
Marry a wife; and what offer pleases you, is granted.

Quae me, and te, and familiam ded^coras, filio luctum paras?
Tum autem ex amicis inimici ut sint nobis affines facis;

Tu sola exorere, quae perturbas haec tua impudentia.

So. Egone?

La. Tu, inquam, mulier, quae me omnino lapidem, non hominem putas.
An quia ruri crebro esse soleo, nescire arbitramini,
Quo quisque pacto hic vitam vestrorum exigat?

Ideo quia ut vos mihi domi eritis, proinde ego pro fama foris.
Jampridem equidem audivi cepisse odium tui Phil^men^m:
Minimeque adeo mi^um; and ni id fecisset, magis mi^um foret.
Sed non credidi adeo, ut etiam hanc totam odisset domum;

At vide quam immerito aeg^itudo haec oritur mihi abs te, Softrata;
Rus habitatum abii, concedens vobis, and rei serviens,
Sumptus vestros otiumque ut nostra res posset pati,
Meo labori haud parcens, praeter aequum atque a tatem meam.


So. Non mea opera, neque pol culpa evenit.

La. Immo maxim.
Sola hic fuisti, in te omnis haeret culpa, Sostr^^^.
Quae hic erant, curares, cum ego vos solvi c^ caeteris.
Cum puella anum suscepisse inimicitias non pudet?


So. Haud equidem dico, mi Laches.

La. Gaud^o, ita me Dii ament, gnati causa. Number de te quidem
Satis scio, peccando detrimenti nihil fieri potest.

So. Qui scis, an ^a causa, mi vir, me odisse se a^. verit,
(...) cum matre una plus esset?

La. Quid ais? non signi sat est,


So. Etenim lassam ^am oppido tum ai^bant: eo ad ^am non admissa sum.

La. Tuos esse illi mo^es mo^bum magis quam aliam rem arbitror:
Et merito adeo; nam vestrarum nulla est, quin g^atum velit^
Ducere uxorem; and quae vobis placita est conditio, datur.


Act II. Scen. II.
PHIDIPPUS. LACHES. SOSTRATA. Ph. ALthough I know, Philum^na, I have authority
to compel you,
To do what I command you; yet I being ^vercome with a fatherly affection
Will willingly yield to you, neither* will I cross your will.

La. And look I see Phidippus in very good time; n^w I shall know of him what
the matter is.
Phidippus, though I know that I am very yielding to all mine,
Yet not so far as my gentle nature should corrupt their minds;
Which same thing if you would be, it would do more for your good and ours also.
Now I see you have your head under their girdles.

Ph. Soft for so^th.

La. I came to you yesterday concerning your daughter, you sent me away as
uncertain as I came.

For you to conceal your anger; if we have done any thing amiss, out with it:
For we will make you amends, either by confuting, or excusing it,
You your self being the judge: but if that be the cause of keeping her with
you,
Because she is sick, I suppose you do me wrong, Phidippus,

Bu^ swear, I do not yield this unto you, though you be her father,
That you should desire her safety more then I; and that the rather for (...)
son's sake,
Whom (...) conceive does esteem her no less then himself.
Ne^r is it so unknown to me, how heavily I think he may take it,


Ph. Laches, I acknowledge both your diligence and kindness toward my
daughter,
And persuade my self, that all things which you say, is as you say:
And I desire you to believe me this, I labor that she may return to you,
If I may effect it by any means.

La. What thing hinders you from doing it?


Ph. No. For after I minded
More, and began to constrain her by force to return, she swore solemnly
That she could not abide it out at your house, whilst Pamphilus was away.
Another man perhaps has another fault. I am naturally of a soft disposition.
I cannot thwart any of mine.

La. Ho Sostrata!

So. Woe is me poor woman!

Lach.

So. Truly, as now it seems. But would you have any thing?
For there is cause why I must now step to the market.

Lach. (...) will go with you.

Act. II. Scen. II.
PHIDIPPUS. LACHES. SOSTRATA. Ph. ETsi s^io, Philumena, meum jus esse ut te
cogam,
Quae ego imperem facere: ego tamen patrio animo victus faciam
Ut tibi concedam, neque tuae libidini adversabor.

La. Atque eccum Phidippum optime video; jam scibo ex ho^ quid si^t.
(...) Phidippe, etsiego meis me omnibus scio esse adprime obsequente^,
Sed non adeo ut mea facilitas corrumpat illorum animos:
Quod si tu idem faceres, magis in rem and vestram and nostram id esset.
Nunc video in illarum potestate esse te.

Ph. Eja vero.

La. Adii te h^ri de filia; ut veni itidem incertum amisisti.
Haud ita decet, si perpetuam hanc vis esse affinit^tem,
Celare te iras: si quid est peccatum a nobis, profer:
Aut ^a refellendo aut purgando vobis corrigemus,
Tejudice ipso: sin ^a est causa retinendi apud vos,
Quia aegra est, te mihi injuriam facere arbitror, Phidippe,

At ita me Dii ament, haud tibi hoc concedo, etsi illi pater es,
Ut tu illam salvam magis velis, quam ego; id adeo gnati causa,
Que^ ego intellexi illam haud minus quam seipsum, magni facere.
Neque adeo clam me est, quam esse eum graviter laturu credam,


P. Laches, and diligentiam vestram and benignitatem erga meam filiam
Novi, and quae dicis omnia, esse ut dicis, animum induco:
Et te hoc mihi cupio credere; illam ad vos redire studeo,
Si facere possim ullo modo.

La. Quae res te id facere prohibet?


Ph. Minime: nam postquam attendi
Magis, and vi cepi cogere ut rediret, sancte adjurat,
Non posse apud vos, Pamphilo, se, absente perdurare.
Aliud sortasse alii vitii est. Ego sum animo leni natus:
Non possum adversari meis.

Lach. Hem Sostrata?

So. Heu me miseram!

Lach.

Ph. Nunc, quidem, ut videtur. Sed nunquid vis?
Nam est quod me transire ad sorum jam oportet.

Lach. Eo tecum una.

Act. II. Sc^n. III.
SOSTRATA. So. IN good sooth we women are all alike hated by our ^usbands,
Because of a few: which makes us all seem wor^^ie of mischief.
For I swear, as for this that my husband new accuses me, I am blameless,
But it is not an easy thing to be cleared: they have so persuaded themselves,
that all

Otherwise, then if she had been born of my own body; neither do I know, how
this should befall me.
But indeed I earnestly expect my son, that he should return home.

Act. II. Scen. III.
SOSTRAA. So. AE Dipol nos sumus mulieres aeque omnes invisae viris,
Propter paucas: quae omnes faciunt dignae ut videamur malo.
Nam, ita me Dii ament, quod me accusat nunc vir, sum extra noxiam,
Sed non facile est expurgare: ita animum induxerunt; socrus

Habui illam, ac si ex me esset nata: nec qui hoc mihi eveniat, s^io.
Nisi pol filium multis modis jam expecto ut redeat domum.

Act. III. Scen. I.
PAMPHILUS. PARMENO. MYRRHINA. Pam. I Believe never more bitter things befell
any man for love
Then me* O unfortunate man I! have I forborne to make an end of this life?
Was I for this cause so desirous to return home?
For whom how much better had it been to have lived aniewhere in the world,

For to all of us, unto whom any trouble is offered from any place,
All that time of the interim, before it be known, is as gain.

Par. But be it so: I can sooner find a means how you may rid your self of
these troubles.
If you had not returned, these fallings out had been made a great deal more.
Pamphilus, that now both of them will reverence your coming:
You shall know the matter; you shall end their anger; you shall make them
friends again.
These things are light, which your have persuaded your self to be very heavy.

Pam. Why do you comfort me? is any man in the world so wretched as I am?
Before I married her, I had my mind engaged in love elsewhere.

Nevertheless I dur^^ never refuse her, whom my father thrusts upon me.
I have scarcely withdrawn my self thence, and set my mind free which was
entangled with her,
And I had scarcely got hither; lo, a new matter is a-broach, which may also
withdrawn me from this woman.
Besides I think my mother or my wife is in fault about tha^ thing:

For duty, Parmeno, commands me to bear with my mother's wrongs;
Besides; I am beholden to my wife, she did heretofore out of her own good
nature
Bear so many wr^ngs of mine, which she never disclosed in any place.
But it must needs be, Parmeno, that some great matter, I know not what, has
happened,


Par. Truly it is no small matter* but if you will reason rightly,
The greatest fallings out that are sometimes, do not cause
The greatest wrongs; for it often falls out, when in what things one man is
not angry at all,
An hasty man becomes an utter enemy for the same cause.

Wherefore? because they carry a weak spirit, which governs them.
In like manner those women are almost, as children are, of an unstable mind.
Perhaps some one word may have raised this anger betwixt them.

Pam. Go thy way in, Parmeno: and tell them I am come.

Par. Ha, what is this ado?

Pam. Hold youo peace.

Par.
Come nearer: how now, have you perceived it?

Pam. Do not prate.
O Jupiter! (...) hear an outcry*

Par. You speak your self, and do you forbid me?

Myr. Peace, I pray you, my daughter.

Pam. It seems to be Philum^*na's mother's tongue.
I am undone.

Par. Why so?

Pam. Because I am lost.

Par. Wherefore?

Pam. Truly Parmeno,


Par. They said your wife
Philum^ was troubled at I know not what; except that be it, I cannot tell.

Pam. I am undone, why did you not tell me that?

Par. Alas, because I could not tell you all at once.

Pam. What disease is it?

Par. I know not.

Pam. What has no body brought a physician?

Par. I know not.

Pam. Do I linger to go in hence, that I may know the certainty whatever it is
as soon as may be?
Philumena, how shall I now find you affected?
For if there be any danger in you, there is no doubt but I shall die with you

Par. There is no need for me now to follow him in;
For I perceive they cannot endure to look upon us.
Yesterday no body would suffer Sostrata to come in.

Which truly I should beloth, especially for my master's sake,
They will presently say* strata's servant is come in,
And will imagine that he has brought some ill with him,
Whereby the sickness may be increased, which I wish may light on their own
head and age.


Act. III. Scen. I.
PAMPHILUS. PARMENO. MYRRHINA. Pam. NEmini plura ego acerba credo esse ex amore
homini unquam oblata,
Quam mihi. Heu me infelicem! hanccine vitam parsi perdere?
Haccine causa ego eram tantopere cupidus redeundi domum?
Cui quanto fuerat praestabilius, ubivis gentium agere aetatem,

Nam nos omnes, quibus est alicunde aliquis objectus labos,
Omne quod est interea t^mpus, priusquam id rescitu^ est, lucro est.

Par. At sit; citius qui te expedias his aerumnis reperiam;
Si non rediisses, hae irae factae essent multo ampliores;
Pamphile, scio reveri^uras;
Rem cognosces; iram expedies; rursum in gratiam restitues.
Levia sunt, quae tu pergravia esse in animum induxisti tuum.

Pam. Quid consolare me* an quisquam aeque miser est gentium?
Priusquam hanc uxorem duxi, habeba^ animu^ alibi amori deditu^:

Tamen nunqua^ ausus sum recusare eam, qua^ mihi obtrudit pater*
Vix me illinc abstraxi, atque impeditum in ea expedivi animum meum,
Vixque huc contuleram: hem, nova res orta est, porro ab hac quae me abstrahat*
Tum matrem ex ea re aut uxorem in culpa esse arbitror;

Nam matris far injurias, Parmeno, pi^tas jub^^;
Tum uxori ob noxius sum: ita olim suo me ingenio pertulit
Tot meas injurias, quae nunquam in ullo patefecit loco.
Sed magnum, nescio quid, necesse est evenisse, Parmeno,


Par. Haud quidem hercle, parvum est; si vis vero veram rationem exsequi,
Non maxumas, quae maxumae interdum sunt irae, injurias
Faciunt: nam saepe est, quibus in rebus alius ne iratus quidem est,
Cum de ea them causa est iracundus factus inimicissimus.

Quapropter? quia enim, quieos gub^rnat animus, infirmu^ gerunt.
Itidem illae mulieres sunt ferme, ut pu^ri, levi sententia,
Fortasse unum aliquod ve^b^m inter eas i^am hanc consciverit.

Pam. Abi, Parmeno, intro; ac me venisse nuncia.

Par. Hem, quid hoc?

Pam. Tace.

Par.
Accede propius: hem, sensisti^'?

Pam. Noli fabularier.
Proh Jupiter! clamorem au^io.

Par. Tute loqueris, me v^tas?

Myr. Tace, obsecro, mea gnata.

Pam. Matris vox visa est Philumenae.
Nullus sum.

Par. Qui dum?

Pam. Q^a perii.

Par. Quamobrem?

Pam. Nescio quod magnum malum
Parmeno, me celant.

Par. Uxorem Philumemenam
Pavitare, nescio quid, dixerunt; id si forte est, nes^io.

Pam. Interii, cur id mihi non dixisti?

Par. Ah, quia non poteram una omnia.

Pam. Quid morbi est?

Par. Nescio.

Pam. Quid? nemon' medicum adduxit?

Par. Nescio.

Pam. Cesso, hinc ire intro, ut hoc quam primum quicquid est certum sciam?
Philumena mea, te nunc offendam affectam?
Nam si periculum ullum in te inest, periisse me una haud dubium est.

Par. Non usus facto est mihi nunc hunc intro sequi:
Nam invisos nos esse illis sentio.
Heri nemo voluit Sostratam intro admittere.

Quod sane nolim, maxume heri causa mei,
Servum illico introisse dicent Sostratae;
Aliquid tul^^e comminiscentur mali,
Capiti atque aetati illorum morbus qui auctus siet.


Act. III. Scen. II.
SOSTRATA. PARMENO. PAMPHILUS. So. I Poor woman heard a bustle here a while
ago, I know not about what;
I greatly fear, lest Philumena's sickness should be increased;
For which I beseech thee Aesculapius, and thee Salus, that no such thing may
be.
Now I will go to her to visit her.

Par. Ho Sostrata.

So. What now?

Par.

So. O Parmeno, was you here? I am undone; what shall I do poor woman?
Shall not I go see Pamphilus wife, when she is sick hard by?

Pa. Do not go to see her, neither send any one at all to visit her.
For he that loves her, that hates him, I think he plays a double fool:
He wastes his own labor, and does but trouble he^*
And besides your son, as soon as he came, went in to see how she does.

So. What say you? is Pamphilus come?

Par. He is come.

So. I thank God.
Lo my spirit is revived with that word, and care is gone from my heart.

So. Now for that reason most of all I would not have you go in hither:
Philumenas pains shall any whit stake,
I know she will presently tell him all the matter alone by themselves,
Which happened betwixt you; and how your falling out first began;
And lo I see him come forth, how sad he is?

So. O my son.

Pam. O my mother, God save you.

So. I am glad you come safe, is Philumena


Pam. She is somewhat better then she was.

So. God grant it be so.
Why do you weep then? or why are you so sad?

Pam. All is well enough mother.

So. What stir, was that? tell me, did the pain take her on a sudden?

Pam. So it was:

So. What is her disease?

Pam. An ague.

So. A quotidian?

Pam. So they say.
Go in I pray you, mother, I will follow you.

So. Be it so.

Pam. Parmeno do you run to meet the boys, and help them with their burdens.

Par. What? do not they know the way home themselves, which way they may come
back again?

Pam. Do you loiter?

Act. III. Scen. II.
SOSTRATA. PARMENO. PAMPHILUS. So. NEscio quid jamdudum audio hic tumultuari
misera:
Male metuo, ne Philnmenae magis morbus aggravescat;
Quod te Aesculapi and te Salus, ne quid sit hujus, o^^.
Nunc ad eam visam.

Par. Heus Sostrata.

So. Hem.

Par.

So. Ehem Parmeno, tun' hic eras? perii; quid faciam misera?
Non visam uxorem Pamphili, cum in proximo hic sit aegra?

Par. Non visas, nec mittas quidem visendi causa quenquam.
Nam qui amat, cui odio ipsus est, bis facere stulte duco:
Laborem inanem ipsus capit, and illi molestiam affert.
Tum autem filius tuus introiit videre, ut venit, quid agat.

So. Quid ais? an venit Pamphilus?

Par. Venit.

So. Diis gratias habeo.
Ehem istoc verbo animus mihi rediit, and cura ex cord recessit.

Par. Jam ea te causa maxume nunc huc introire nolo;
Philumenae dolores,
Omnem rem narrabit scio continuo sola soli,
Quae inter vos intervenit; unde ortum est initium itae.
Atque eccu^ video ipsum egredi; quam tristis est?

So. O mi gnate.

Pam. Mea matter, salve.

So. Gaudeo venisse salvum: salva n'
Philumena est?

Pam. Meliuscula est.

So. Utinam istuc Dii faxint.
Quid tu igitur lacrumas? aut quid es tam tristis?

Pam. Recte, matter.

So. Quid fuit tumulti? dic mihi, an dolor repent invasit?

Pam. Ita sactum est.

So. Quid morbi est?

Pam. Febris.

So. Quotidiana n'?

Pam. Ita aiunt.
I sodes intro, consequar te, mea matter.

So. Fiat.

Pam. Parmeno, obviam, atque his onera adjuta.

Par. Quid? non sciunt ipsi viam domum qua redeant?

Pam. Cessas?

Act. III. Scen. III.
PAMPHILUS. Pam. I Cannot find any handsome entrance of my business,
Whence I may begin to tell, what things befell me at unawares;
Partly what I beheld with these eyes, and partly what I heard.
Wherefore I got my self, being astonished, the sooner out of doors.

I should see her sick of another disease, then I perceive my wife to be: woe is
me,
After the maids saw I was come, they presently altogether
Merrily cried out, He is come; that was because they had espied ^e (...) a
sudden:
But presently I saw all their countenances to be changed,
Because I had luck to come so unseasonably to them.
One of them by chance in the mean time ran hastily before, and told them I
wus come.
I being desirous to see her, follow on straight; after I came in, I quickly
knew her disease
Poor man. For neither did time give any space that it might be concealed,
Nor was she able to complain in another voice, then the matter advertised her.
After I saw it, O unworthy fact, said I, and presently conveyed
My self thence weeping, being heart-struck with a thing so incredible and
heinous.
Her mother follows me; and just as I was going out over the threshold, she
fell down at my knees
Weeping poor woman; it pitied me to see her. Truly it is so as I think,
So we are high or humble-minded as things offer themselves to all of us.
She continued to have this speech with me from the beginning:
O my Pamphilus, you see the reason wherefore she went from you,
For the maid was defloured long since by I know not what lewd fellow,
Now she is fled hither, that she might conceal her birth from you and others.
But when I remember her entreaties, I cannot but weep poor man.
Whatsoever f^e it is, says she, which brought you to us this day,
We both beseech you by it, if it be right and lawful,
That her misfortunes may be by your means covered, and concealed toward all
folks;
If ever you perceived her, Pamphilus, to bear a loving affection toward you,
She now entreats you, that you would grant her this favor without much ado.
But for bringing her back again, do that which may be for your own good.
You only are privy that she is in travail, and was not with child by you;
For they say she lay with you full two months after,
And now this is the seventh month since she came to you,
Which that you know the thing it self shows; now if it can be, Pamphilus,
I earnestly desire and labor, that the childbirth may happen unknown to her
father,
And every body also; but if it cannot be, but they must perceive it,
I will say that she miscarried; I know no body will suspect otherwise,
But, which is very likely to be true, they will judge straight that you are
the father.
It shall be put out forthwith; here is no less likely to be fall you,
And shall cover the wrong unworthilie done to her poor woman.
I promised her, and I am resolved to keep my promise in that which I said.
For as for bringing her back, I think that is not any whit convenient,
Neither will I do it, though her love and familiarity greatly engage me.
I can but weep, when I remember, what a life I shall have hereafter,
And lonelie condition. O fortune, how thou art never ^cnsta^^lie good!
But now my former love has made me used to this thing,
Which I purposelie let pass; I will now endeavor to do the like in this
matter.
Parmeno is here with the boys; it is not requisite he should be by
In this business: for heretofore I told him only,
That I refrained from her at the first when she was given me.
I am afraid, if he shall hear her skriek often,
Lest he should perceive she is in labor; I must needs send him hence
On some errant somewhither, till Philumena be brought in bed.

Act. III. Scen. III.
PAMPHILUS. Pam. NEqueo mearum rerum initium ullum invenire idoneum,
Unde exordiar narrare, quae nec opinanti accidunt.
Partim quae perspexi his oculis partim quae accepi auribus.
Qua me propter exanimatum citius eduxi soras.

Morbo me visurum ad fectam, ac sensi uxorem esse; hei mihi,
Postquam me aspexere ancillae advenisse, illico omnes simul
Laetae exclamant, Venit: id quod me repent adspexerant,
Sed continuo vultum earum sensi immutari omnium,

Una illarum forte interea propere praecucurrit nuntians me venisse;
Ego ejus videndi cupidus, recta consequor: posteaquam introii, extemplo ejus
morbum
Cognovi miser. Nam neque ut celari posset tempus spatium ullum dabat:
Neque voce alia, ac res mon^bat, ipsa poterat conqueti.

Me inde lacrumans, incredibili re atque atroci percitus.
Matter consequitur: jam ut limen exirem, ad genua accidit
Lacrumans misera; miseritum est. Profecto sic est ut puto,
Omnibus nobis, ut res dant sese, ita magni atque humiles sumus.

O mi Pamphile, abs te quam ob rem abierit, causam vides:
Nam vitium est oblatum virgini olim ab nescio quo improbo;
Nunc huc confugit, te atque alios partum ut celaret suum.
Sed cum orata ejus reminiscor, nequeo quin lacrumem miser.

Per eam te obsecramus ambae, si jus, si fas est, uti
Adversa ejus per te tecta tacitaque apud omnes siet;
Si unquam erga te animo esse amico sensisti eam, Pamphile,
Sine labor hanc gratiam te uti sibi des, illa ^un^ rogat.
Caeterum de reducenda, id facias quod in rem sit tuam.
Partutire eam neque gravidam esse ex te solus conscius;
Nam aiunt tecum post duobus concubuisse eam mensibus:
Tum postquam ad te venit, mensis agitur hic jam septimus,
Quod te scire ipsa indicat res; nunc si potis est, Pamphile,

Atque adeo omnes; sed si fieri id non potest, quin sentiant,
Dicam abortam esse: scio nemini aliter suspectum sore,
Quin, quod verisimile est, ex te recte eum natum putent.
Continuo exponetur; hic' tibi nihil est quicquam incommodi,

Pollicitus sum, and servare in eo certum est, quod dixi, fidem.
Nam de reducenda, id vero neutiquam honestum esse arbitror.
Nec faciam, etsi amor me graviter, consuetudo que ejus tenet.
Lachrymo, quae post hac futura est vita, cum in mentem venit,

Sed jam prior amor me ad hanc rem exercitatum reddidit,
Quem ego consilio missum feci: idem nunc huic operam dabo.
Adest Parmeno cum pueris: hunc minime est opus
In hac re adesse: nam olim soli credidi,

Vereor si clamorem ejus hic crebro audiat,
Ne parturire intelligat. Aliquo mihi est
Hinc abl^gandus, dum parit Philumena.

Act. III. Scen. IV.
PARMENO. SOSIA. PAMPHILUS. Par. DO you say you had an ill journey of this?

So. Truly Parmeno it cannot be expressed in words,
So much, as it is indeed incommodious to sail.

Par. Is it so?

So. O happy man, you know not what evil*

For that I may omit other miseries, consider but this one,
I was thirty days or more then that, in the ship,
When in the mean time I poor man ever looked for death:
We had such a tempest continual^ie against us.

Par.

So. It is not unknown to me; to conclude, I would run away
Rather then return, if I knew I was to return thither.

Par. Heretofore indeed slight occasions moved you
To do, Sosia, that which you now threaten to do.
But I see Pamphilus himself stand before the door;

Master, what do you stand here?

Pam. Truly I am looking for you.

Par. What is the matter?

Pam. One must needs step in to the Castle.

Par. Who?

Pam. You.

Par. Into the Castle, why thither?

Pam. Go meet with Callidemides my host,
Who was brought hither together with me.

Par.
Home safe, he would quite burst me with walking-up and down.

Pam. Why do you loyter?

Par. What would you have me say? should I only meet him?

Pam. Yes, tell him that whereas I appointed to meet with him to day.
I cannot do it; and that he may not in vain tarry for me there, make haste.

Par.

Pam. But I will teach you how to know him.
He is a big-man, ruddie, curled, gross, gray-eyed,
A ghastly face.

Par. A destruction light upon him.
What if he will not come? shall I tarry till the evening?

Pam. Don' tarry: run.

Par. I cannot; I am so weary.

Pam.
How I should conceal this, which Myrrhina entreated me,
The child birth of her daughter: for I pity the woman,
I will do what I can, yet so as to show my duty,
For I ought rather to give way to my mother, then the love of her.

They come on hitherwards; I know not what I should say to these.

Act. III. Scen. IV.
PARMENO. SOSIA. PAMPHILUS. Par. AIn'tu tibi incommodum hoc evenisse iter?

So. Non hercle verbis, Parmeno, dici potest
Tantum, quam re ipsa navigare incommodum est.

Par. Itane est?

So. O fortunate, nescis quid mali

Nam alias ut mittam miserias, unam hanc vide;
Dies triginta aut plus eo, in navi fui,
Cum interea semper mortem expectabam miser;
Ita usque advorsa tempestate usi sumus.

Par.

So. Haud clam me est; denique hercle au* fungerim
Potius, quam redeam, si eo mihi redeundum sciam.

Par. Olim quidem te causae impellebant leves,
Quod nunc minitare facere, ut faceres, Sosia.
Sed Pamphilum ipsum video stare ante ostium;

Here, etiam tu hic stas?

Pam. Equidem te exspecto.

Par. Quid est?

Pam. In arcem transcurso opus est.

Par. Cui homini?

Pam. Tibi*

Par. In arcem, quid co?

Pam. Callidemidem hospitem
Qui mecum una advectus est, conveni.

Par.
Rediisset unquam, ut me ambulando rumperet.

Pam. Quid cessas?

Par. Quid vis dicam? an conveniam modo?

Par. Imo quod constitui me hodie conventurum cum,
Non posse: and ne me frustra illic exspectet: vola.

Par.

Pam. At faciam ut noveris,
Magnus, rubicundus, crispus, crassus, caesius,
Cadaverosa facies.

Par. Dii illum perduint.
Quid si non veniat? man^amne usque ad vesperem?

Pem. Maneto; curre.

Par. Non queo; ita defessus sum.

Pam.
Quo pacto hoc celem, quod me oravit Myrrhina,
^uae g^atae partum; nam me miseret mulieris.
Quod potero faciam, tamen ut pietatem colam:
Nam me parenti potius quam amori obsequi

Video, horsum pergunt; quid dicam hisce incertus sum.

Act. III. Scen. V.
LACHES. PHIDIPPUS. PAMPHILUS. La. Did not you say a while ago that she said
she looked for her son?

Ph. It is so.

La. They say he is come. Let her come home aga^

Pam. I know not what reason I can allege to my father,
Why I should not bring her back again.

La. Whom did I hear speak here?

Pa^. I am resolved to go on forward in my way, and to pursue the course I have
intended.


Pam. God save you, my father.

La. My son, God save you.

Ph. It is well done that you are come, Pamphilus.
And so sound and lusty, which is the main matter.

Pam. I believe you.

Lach. Are you but now come?

Pam. Yes.

La. Tell me what has Phania my sisters son
Left behind him?

Pam. To say truly, he was a man given to his pleasure

But they leave themselves this commendation; He lived merrily, whilst he
lived.

La. Have you brought nothing then hither more then one sentence?

Pam. What ever it is, that which he left, has done us good.

La. Nay rather, it has done us hurt:
For I could wish he were alive and in health.

Pb. You may wish that without any danger,


La. This man commanded Philumena yesterday to be sent for: say you did command.

Ph. Do not hit me on the side: I did command.

La. But he will now send her back.

Ph. Yes that he will.

Pam. I know all the matter how it is carried, I heard all even now as I came.

La. But a mischieflight on those envious persons, that are ready to tell you
these things.

Pam.
Work me any reproach; and if I would now make rehearsal of that here,
What a faithful kind, and gentle mind I have born toward her,
I might truly do it, but that I had rather you should know these thing from
her;
For by that means you shall most of all give credit to my condition,

And I call God to witness that this falling out did not happen through my
default.
But forasmuch as she thinks her self unworthy of my mother,
Whom she should yield to, and whose conditions she should bear with through
her own modesty,
And seeing a reconcilement can by no other means be made betwixt them;

Now dutte bids me rather to look after my mothers good.

La. Pamphilus, I have not been unwilling to hear your discourse,
Seeing I perceive you set light by every thing in respect of your mother:
But Pamphilus, have a care, lest being moved by anger you go stubbornlie on.

Pam.
Who never did any thing against me, father,
Which I would not have done? and I kn^, she has often done, what I desired:
I both love and commend her, and greatly desire her:
I have tried her to be of a wonderful good nature to me ward,
And I wish to her, that she may spend the rest of her life
With that husband, who may be more fortunate then I,
Forasmuch as necessity parts me from her.

Ph. What is in your power, that it may not be.

La. If you be well in your wits,
Bid her to return.

Pam. That is none of my purpose, father:


La. Whither go you? tarry,
Tarry, I say, whither go you?

Ph. What a stubborn trick is this?

La. Did not I tell you, Phidippus, that he would take this matter impatiently?
Wherefore I entreated you, that you would send your daughter back again.

Ph. Truly I did not think that he would be so churlish;

If it be, that he is willing to bring his wife back, he may.
But if he be of another mind, let him pay back her portion hither; let him go.

La. But lo, you also are peevishlie teastie.

Ph. Pamphilus, you are returned to us hither very stubborn*

La.

Ph. Because ye have got a little money,
Your minds are grown lofty.

La. Do you fall out with me too?

Ph. Let him consider, and bring me word again to day.
Whether he will, or he will not, that she may be for another man, if she be
not for him.

La.
Let them end it at last amongst themselves, as they please:
Seeing neither my son nor this man will be ruled by me:
They care not a pin for what I say. I will carry this chi^ing fit
To my wife: by whose advice all these things are done:

La. Venisse ajunt. Redeat.

Pam. Quam causam dicam patri,
Quamobrem non reducam, nescio.

La. Quem ego hic audivi loqui?

Pam. Certum obfirmare est viam me, quam decrevi, persequi.

La. Ipsus est, de quo hoc agebam tecum.

La. Gnate mi, salve.

Ph. Been factum te advenisse, Pamphile.
Et adeo, quod maxumum est, salvum atque validum.

Pam. Creditur.

La. Advenis modo?

Pam. Admodum.

La. Cedo, quid reliquit Phania
Consobrinus noster?

Pam. Sane hercle homo voluptati obsequens

Sibi vero hanc laudem relinquunt; vixit, dum vixit, been.

La. Tum^ igitur nihil attulisti huc plu^ una* sententia?

Pam. Quicquid est, id quod reliquit, profuit.

La. Imo, obfuit:
Nam illum vivum and salvum vellem.

Ph. Impune optare istuc licet.


La. Heri Philumenam ad se accersi hic jussit: dic jussisse te.

Ph. Noli sodere; jussi.

La. Sed came jam remittet.

Ph. Scilicet.

Pam. Omnem rem scio ut sit gesta, adveniens audivi omnia modo.

La. At istos invidos Dii perdant, qui haec libenter nunciant tibi.

Pam.
Fieri a vobis posset; idqu* si nunc memorare velim,
Quam fideli and be^igno animo in illam and clementi fui,
Vere possim; ni^ ex ^a haec magis velim rescis^ere;
Namque eo pacto maxu^ apud te meo erit ingenio fides,

Neque mea culpa hoc dissidium evenisse id testor Deos.
Sed quando sese esse indignam deputat matri meae,
Cui concedat, cujusque mores toleraret sua modestia;
Neque alio pacto componi potest inter eas gratia;


La. Pamphile, haud invito ad aures sermo mihi accessit tuus,
Cum te post pu* ass omnes res prae parente intelligo.
Verum vide ne impulsus ira prave insistas, Pamphile.

Pam.
Quae nunquam quicquam erga me commerita est, pater,
Quod nollem? and saepe meritam, quod vellem, scio.
Amoque and laudo, and vehementer* desidero:
Nam fuisse erga me miro ingenio expertus sum,
Illique exopto, ut reliquam vitam exigat
Cum eo viro, me qui sit fortunatior,
Quandoquidem illam a me distrahit necessitas.

Ph. Tibi id in manu est, ne fiat.

La. Si sanus satis sies,
Jabe illam redire.

Pam. Non est consilium, pater:


La. Quo abis? mane,
Mane, inquam; quo vadis?

Ph. Quae est haec pertinacia?

La. Dixin', Phidippe, hanc rem aegre laturum esse eum?
Quamobrem orabam ut filiam remitteres.

Ph. Non credidi aedipol adeo inhumanum fore;

Si est, ut velit reducere uxorem, licet:
Sin alio est animo, renumeret dotem huc, eat.

La. Ecce autem, tu quoque proterve irracundus es.

Ph. Percontumax redisti huc* nobis, Pamphile.

La.

Ph. Quia paulum vobis accessit pecuniae,
Sublati animi sunt.

La. Etiam mecum litigas?

Ph. Deliberet, renuncietque hodie mihi,
Velitne, an non; ut alii, si huic non sit, siet.

La.
Post^emo inter se transigant ipsi, ut lubet;
Quando nec guatus neque hic mihi quicquam obtemperant:
Quae dico parvi pendunt: porto hoc jurgium
Ad uxorem; cujus haec fiunt consilio omnia:


Act. IV. Scen. I.
MYRRHINA. PHIDIPPUS.. My. I Am undone, what shall I do? which way shall I
turn my self? what answer
Shall I poor wretch make to my husband? for he seemed to have heard the voice
of the crying child:
He got himself away on such a sudden to my daughter and said nothing:
But if he shall perceive she is brought to bed, truly I do not know,

But the door creeks; I believe he comes forth to me. I am undone.

Ph. My wife, as soon as she saw I went to my daughter, got her self out of
doors; and lo I see her.
What say you, Myrrhina? Ho, I speak to you.

My. To me, my husband?

P. Am I your husband? do you verily account me to be a husband or a man?

I should not have been thus made a laughing stock by your doings.

My. By what?

Ph. Do you ask?
Is my daughter delivered? ha do you not speak? of whom?

My. Is it fit for a father to ask the question?
I am undone; of whom think you but of him to whom she was married, I pray you?

Ph. I believe it, neither is it for a father to think otherwise. But I wonder,

Especially seeing she was both safely delivered, and according to her counts:
That you should be so crosse-minded, as to wish the child to be lost,
By whom you might understand the friendship amongst us would hereafter be more
stable,
Rather then she should be married with him against your will.


My. I am a wretched woman.

Ph. I wish I knew that was so. But now I remember,
What you said about this matter heretofore, when we took him to be our son in
law,
For you said you could not abide that your daughter should be married
With him which loved an harbor, who lodged out of doors.

Myr.

Ph. I knew long before you, Myrrhina, that he had a sweetheart,
But I never judged that to be a fault of youth;
For that is ingrafted in all men; but truly the time will be shortly, when he
will also dislike himself.
But as heretofore you have showed your self to be the same, you have not
ceased hitherto

Now this thing plainly discovers, how you would have it done.

My. Do you think I am so ^^^art toward (...), to whom I am a mother,
That I should be of that mind, if this marriage might be for our good?

Ph. Are you able to foresee or judge what may be for our benefit?

Going out or coming in to his sweetheart: what then of all this,
If he have done this modestly and seldom? is it not more friendly
For us to dissemble, then to labor to know those things, whereby he should
beat us?
For if he can on a sudden withdraw himself from her

Neither a man nor a husband constant enough to my daughter.

My. Let the young man alone, I pray you,
And those things which you say I have done amiss: go your way, talk you alone
by your selves.
Ask him whether he will have his wife or not; if it be that he say he will,
Let him have her again; but if it be that he will not, then have I well
provided for my daughter.

Ph. Myrrhina perceived there was a fault
In him, I was by, by whose advice it was fitting those things should have been
ordered.
Wherefore I am inflamed with anger that you should dare to do these things
without my bidding,
I charge you, that you carry not the child any whither out of the house.
But I am the more fool that require her to obey my commands:


Myr. I think truly no woman* ^th more miserable then I.
For indeed it is not unknown to me, how he will take this,
If he understand the matter it self, how it is; seeing he takes this so
impatiently, which is a lighter thing.
Neither do I know which way his mind may be changed.

If he shall constrain me to bring up the child, whose father we know not, who
he is.
For when my daughter was ravished, his feature could not be known in the dark:
Neither was then ani^ thing plucked from him, whereby she might afterward know
who he was:
He himself when he went away snatched away a ring by force from the maid,
which she had on her finger.
Pamphilus cannot conceal what we entreated him
Any longer, when he shall know another man's child to be brought up instead
of his.

Act. IV. Scen. I.
MYRRHINA. PHIDIPPVS. My. PErii, quid agam? quo me vortam? quid viro meo
respondebo
Misera? nam audisse vocem pueri visus est vagientis;
Ita corripuit de repent tacitus sese ad filiam:
Quod si resciverit peperisse eam, id qua causa

Sed ostium concrep^credo ipsum exire ad me; nulla sum*

Ph. Uxor, ubi me ad filiam ire sensit, se duxit for as; atque eccam video.
Quid ais, Myrrhina? Heus tibi dico.

My. Mihine, mi vir?

Ph. Vir ego tuus sum? tune viru^ me aut homine^ deputas adeo esse?

Non sic ludibrio tuis factis habitus essem.

My. Quibus?

Ph. Rogitas?
Peperit filia? hem taces? ex quo?

My. Istuc patrem rogare aequum est?
Perii: ex quo censes, nisi ex illo cui data est nuptum, obsecro.

Ph. Credo, neque arbitrari patris est aliter. Sed demiror

Partum, praesertim cum and recte and tempore suo peperit;
Adeon' pervicaci esse animo, ut puerum peroptares perire,
Ex quo firmiorem inter nos fore amicitiam posthac scires,
Potius, quam advorsum animi tui libidinem esset cum illo nupta?
Ego etiam illorum esse hanc culpam credidi, quae te est penes.

Myr. Misera sum.

Ph. Utinam sciam ita esse istuc. Sed nunc mihi in mentem venit,
Ex hac re quod loquuta es olim, cum illum generum cepimus,
Nam negabas nuptam filiam posse tuam te p^^i
Cum eo qui meretricem amaret, qui pernoctaret fo^is.

My.

Ph. Multo prius scivi, quam tu, illum habere ^micam, Myrrhin^,
Verum id vitium ego nunquam decrevi esse adolescentiae:
Nam id omnibus innatum est; at pol jam aderit tempus, se quoque etiam cum
oderit;
Sed ut olim ostendisti te eandem esse, nihil ces^^visti usque adhuc,

Id nunc indicium haec res facit, quo pacto factum volueris.

My. Adeon' me esse pervicacem censes, cui matter siem,
Ut eo essem animo, si ex usu esset nostro hoc matrimonium?

Ph. Tun' prospicere, aut judicare, nostram in rem quod sit, potes?

Exeuntem aut introeuntem ad amicam: quid tum postea,
Si mode^ e ac raro hoc fecit? non dissimulare nos
Magis humanum est, quam dare operam id scire, qui ^os oderit?
Nam si ipse posset ab ea s^se de repent avellere,

Nec virum satis firmum gnatae.

Myr. Mitte adolescentem, obsecro,
Et quae me peccasse ais: abi, solus solum conveni.
Rogas, velitne an non uxorem; si est, ut dicat velle se,
Read sin est autem ut nolit, recte confului meae.

Ph. Myrrhina,
Peccatum; aderam, cujus consilio fuerat ea parprospici.
Quamobrem incendor ira te esse ausam facere haec injussu meo.
Interdico, ne extulisse extra aedes puerum usquam ve^^s.
Sed ego stultior meis dictis pare^e hanc qui postulem:


Myr. Nullam pol credo mulierem me miseriorem vivere,
Nam ut hic laturus hoc sit, si ipsam ^em ut (...), resciverit,
Non aedipol clam me est, cum hoc quod levius est, tam animo i^acu^d^ tulit,
Nec qua via sententia ejus possit mutari scio.

Si, puerum ut tollam, coget, cujus, nos, qui sit, nescimus, pa^er:
Nam cum compressa est gnata, forma in tenebris, nos^i non quita est;
Neque d^^ractum ^i nunc quic quam est, qui post possit noscere, qui siet:
Ipse erip^it vi, in digito quem habuit virgini abiens annulum.
Pamphilum ne orata nostra nequeat diutius
Celare, cum sciet alienum puerum tolli pro suo.

Act. IV. Scen. II.
SOSTRATA. PAMPHILUS. So. IT is not unknown to me, my son, that I am suspected
by you, that your wife
Is gone away hence because of my demeanor, although you dissemble those
things all you can.
But, I swear, and so let those things which I wish befall me from you,
As I never wittingly deserved, that she should justly distaste me:

For your father told me even now within, how you preferred me
Before your love* now I am resolved on the other side to requite your good
(...),
That you may know there is a reward said up for your dutiful ^ction.
My Pamphilus, I think this will be good for you, and for my credit*
I am certainli^ determined to go hence into the country with your father,
Last my presence should be a let; and that no other cause may be left
remaining,
But that your Philum^na may return to you.

P. What resolution is this, I pray you?
Should you being overcome by her folly remove out of the city into the
country to dwell?
You shall not do it; neither will I suffer, that he, mother, that would say
ill of us,

Besides, I will not have you to forsake your friends, and kinswomen and
holie-daies
For my sake.

So. Truly those things afford me no pleasure now;
I discharged my duty sufficiently, whilst the time of my age served; now I
am glutted
With those employments; this is now my great care, that the length of my age

I see I am here hated undeservedlie; it is time to depart;
Thus, as I suppose, I shall very well cut off all alledgments from every
body,
And acquit myself of this suspicion, and give way to them.
I pray you let me avoid this thing, for which the common sort of wo^^^ is ill
spoken of.

P.
Having this such a (...), and her such a wife!

So. I pray you, (...) Pamphilus,
(...) you persuade your self to suffer an inconveni^xcie, as any one is
offered:
If other things be so as you desire, and she so, as I judge her to be?
Grant (...) this, my son, bring her back again.

Pam. Woe is me poor man.

So.

Propter meos mores hinc abiisse, etsi ea dissimu^as sedulo.
Verum, ita me Dii ament, itaque ob^ingant ex te quae opto mihi,
Ut nunquam sciens commerui, merito ut caperet odium illa mei;

Nam mihi intus pater tuus narravit modo, quo pacto me habueris
P^aepositum amoti tuo; nu^c tibi me ce^tum est contra gratiam refer
Ut apud me praemium esse positum pietati scias.
Mi Pamphile, hoc and vobis, and meae ^omn odum ^a^^ae arbittor*

Ne mea praesentia obstet; neu causa ulla restet reliqua,
Quin tua Philumena ad te redeat.

P. Quaeso quid istuc consilii est
Illius stultitia victa, ex urbe tu rus habitatum mig^es?
Haud facies: neque sinam, ut qui robis, matter, maledictum velit,

Tum tuas amicas te, and cognatas deserere and f^stos dies
Mea causa nolo.

So. Nihil pol jam istaec mihi res voluptatis serunt;
Dum aetatis tempus tulit, perfuncta satis sum; satias jam me tenet
Studiorum istorum; haec mihi nunc cura est ^axima, ut ne c^i meae

Hic video me esse invisam in merito: tempus est concedere;
Sic optume, ut ego opino^, omnes causas praecidam omnibus,
Et m^ hac suspicione exsolvam, and illis morem gessro.
Sine me obsecro hoc efsugere, vulgus quod male audit mulierum.

P.
Hanc matrem habens talem, illam autem ^xor^m!

So. Ob^o, mi Pamphile,
Non tute incon m^dam rem, ut quaeque est, in ani^m indu^ as pati:
Si caetera ita sunt ut tu vis, itaque ut esse ego illam existimo:
Mignate, da ^eniam hanc mihi, reduce illam.

LACHES. SOSTRATA PAMPHILUS. La. I Have heard, wife, what talk you had with
him, as I stood aloof off from hence.
This is wisdom, how you may be able to turn your mind, wheresoever there is
need;
If you now shall do that same thing, which you must perhaps do afterward.

So. God speed us well.

Lach. Go into the country then, there I will bear with you, and you with me.

So.

Lach. Go in then, and pack up, what you are to carry with you.
I have told you.

So. I will do as you bid me.

Pam. Father.

Lach. What would you have, Pamphilus?

P. That my mother go hence? by no means.

Lach. Why would you have that so?

P. Because I am yet unresolved what to do coucerning my wife.

Lach. What is the matter?
What will you do, but bring her back?

Pam. Truly I desire it, and can scarcely be withheld,

I believe for that reason they will better agree, if I do not bring her back
again.

Lach. You know not, you cannot; but it makes no matter to you, whether they do
it or no.
When she shall be gone: this age is loathsome to young folks:
It is but reason we depart into an other world. Lastly, we are now become a
tale,
Pamphilus, an old man, and an old woman. But I see Phidippus to come forth
In good time. Let us go to him.

Dixi.

So. Ita ut jubes faciam.

P. Hinc abire mattem? minime.

Lach. Quid ita istuc vis?

P. Quia de uxore incertus etiam quid (...) facturus.

La. Quid est?
Quid vis facere, nisi reducere?

P. Equidem cupio, and vix contineor.

Quando haec abierit: odiosa haec ae^as est adolescentulis.
E medio aequmn excedere est. Postremo, nos jam fabu^ae sumus,

Act. IV. Scen. IV.
PHIDIPPUS. LACHES. PAMPHILUS. Ph. Truly, Philumena, I am angry also with you,
And very much indeed; for in truth it is dishonestlie done of you,
Although you have had an excuse for this matter, a mother that enforced you;
But she has no excuse.

La. Phidippus you present your self to me very fitly,


Ph. What is the matter?

Pam. What shall I answer these? or how shall I lay open this thing?

La. Tell your daughter that Sostrata is going hence into the country,
That she may not fear, that she cannot now return home.

Ph. Alas,
Your wife has deserved no blame about these matters:
Myrrhina.

Pam. Here is an alteration made.

Ph. She troubles us, Laches.

Pam. Let them trouble on as much as they will, so that I may not bring her
back.

Ph. Pamphilus, truly I would have this affinity to be long-lasting Amongst
us, if it can be done.

Do you take the child.

Pam. He knows she is brought in bed, I am undone.

Lach. The child? what child?

Ph. We have a grandchild born us.
For my daughter was brought great with child from your house,
Neither did I ever know before this day that she was great with child.

Lach.
That he is borne you, and that she is in health; but what kind of woman
Have you to wife? or with what conditions is she manoured?
That we should have this concealed from us so long: I cannot sufficiently
Viter how badlie me thinks this is done.

Ph. Laches.

Pam. Though a good while ago this was doubtful to me,
Now it is not; seeing another man's child follows her.

La. Pamphilus, there is now no consultation for you here.

Pam. I am undone.

Lach. We did oftentimes wish to see this day,

It is now come to pass, I thank God.

Pam. I am undone.

Lach. Bring your wife back again, and be not against me.

Pam. Father, if she meant to have children by me,
Or was willing to be married to me, I know very well,

Now when I perceive her mind is estranged from me,
And I think that we shall not hereafter agree betwixt our selves,
Why should I bring her back again?

Lach. The young woman did,
What her mother persuaded her to; is that to be wondered at?

Which is without a fault? or is it because men do not amiss?

Ph. Do ye your selves consider now, Laches, and you, Pamphilus,
Whether it be requisite for you, that she be sent back, or brought home again.
What my wife does, is not in my power.

But what shall we do with the child?

La. You ask fondly;
Whatever become of it, give it him, his own I say,
That we may bring up ours.

Pam. Whom the father himself has neglected,
Should I bring it up?

Lach. What said you? what, shall we not bring it up, Pamphilus?

Truly I cannot now at all hold my peace,
For you make me speak those things which I am loath, whilst he is by,
Do you think that I am ignorant why you weep?
Or what that is at which your are troubled on this manner?

This wife home, because of your mother,
She promised that she would go out of the house.
Now, after you see this excuse will not serve your turn;
Because the child is born unknown to you, you have got another excuse.

What a long time have I given you to love your paramour,
That once now at last you might incline your mind hitherward?
How quietly I have endured the costs which you have bestowed on her?
I have dealt with you, and entreated you to marry a wife;
I told you it was time, by mine enforcement you have married.
Wherein you yielded to me, you did as it became you;
Now again have you set your mind on a where?
Whom you striving to please do wrong to your wife,
For, Pamphilus, I see you are tumbled back again
Into the same kind of life.

Pam. What I?

Lach. You your self, and you do wrong,
When you feign lying excuses, to cause variance,
That you may live with her, when you have removed this woman being a witness
from you.
And your wife has also perceived it; for what other reason had she,
Why she should go from you?

Ph. He guesseth very right, for that is it.

Pam.

Lach. Ha,
Bring back your wife again, or tell me, why there is no need of it.

Pam. It is not now time.

Lach. Take the child, for he indeed
Is in no fault: I will afterward take order for the mother.

Pam. I am miserable all kind of ways; neither do I know what I should do,

I will be gone hence, seeing I do little good being present.
For I believe they will not take away the child without my bidding,
Especially seeing my mother-in-law is my helper in that matter.

Lach. Are you running away? ho, will you give me no certain answer?

Give me the child Phidippus, I will bring it up.

Ph. Yes.
My wife did no wonder, if she took this ill.
Women are spiteful, they do not easily bear these things.
Therefore is this falling out, for she herself told me

Neither did I at first believe her: but now it is manifest;
For I see his mind is quite set against marriage.

Lach. What shall I do then, Phidippus? what advice do you give me?

Ph. What should you do? I think we must first go to this where.
Let us entreat her, let us accuse her, lastly, let us threaten (...) heartily,
If ever she have to do with him hereafter.

Lach. I will do as you advise. Ho boy, run to this Bacchis
Our neighbor, call her forth hither in my (...)*
And I entreat you further that you would be an assistant to me in this matter.

Ph. Ah,
Lac^es,
I would have this affinity to last betwixt us,
If it be by any means that it can be, as I hope it will.
But would you have me be by with you, whilst you talk with her?

Lac. Nay rather, go your way, and provide some nurse for the child.

Etsi tibi causa est de hac re, matter quae te impulit;
Huic vero nulla est.

La. Opportune te mihi

Myrrhina haec sunt mea uxore exorta omnia.

Pam. Mutatio fit.

Ph. Ea nos perturbat, Laches.

Pam. Dum ne reducam, turbent po^o, quam velint.

Ph. Ego, Pamphile, esse inter nos, si fieri potest,
Affinitatem hanc sane perpetuam volo;

Accipias puerum.

Pam. Sensit peperisse, occidi.

La. Pu^rum? quem puerum?

Ph. Natus est nobis nepos.
Nam abducta a vobis praegnans fuerat filia,
Neque fuisse praegnantem unquam ante hunc s^ivi diem.

La.
Natum illum tibi, and illam salvam; sed quid mulieris
Uxorem habes? aut quibus moratam moribus?
Nos ne hoc celatos tam diu; nequeo satis
Quam hoc mihi videtur factum prave, proloqui.

Ph. Laches.

Pam. Etsi jam dudum fuerat ambig^um hoc miai,
Nunc non est, cum eam consequitur alienus pue^*

La. Nulla tibi, Pamphile, hic jam consultatio est.

Pa. Perii.

Lae. Hunc videre saepe optabamus diem,

Evenit, habeo gratiam Diis.

Pam. Nullus sum.

La. Reduc uxorem, ac noli adversari mihi.

Pam. Pater, si illa ex me liberos vellet sibi,
Aut se esse mecum nuptam, satis certo scio,

Nunc cum ejus alienum a me animum sentiam,
Neque conventurum inter nos posthac esse arbitror,
Quam ob rem reducam?

La. Matter quod suasit sua,
Adolescens mulier fecit: mirandumne id est?

Quae careat culpa? an quia non delinquunt viti?

Ph. Vosmet videte jam, Laches, and tu Pamphile,
Remissan' opus sit vobis, reductan' domum:
U^or quid faciet in manu non est mea.

Sed quid faciemus puero?

La. Ridicule rogas?
Quicquid futurum est, huic reddas; suum scilicet,
Ut alamus nostrum.

Pam. Quem ipse neglexit pater,
Ego alam?

Lach. Quid dixti? eho, annon alemus, Pamphile?

Enimvero prorsus jam tacere non queo,
Nam cogis ea quae nolo, ut, praesente hoc, loquar.
Ignarum censes tuarum lachrymarum esse me?
Aut quid sit hoc id quod solicitere ad hunc modum?

Matrem non posse habere hanc uxorem domi;
Pollicita est ea se concessuram aedibus.
Nunc, postquam adempta^ hanc quoque causam vides,
Puer quia clam te est natus, nactus alteram es;

Aliquando tandem huc animum ut adducas tuum,
Quam longum spacium amandi amicam tibi dedi?
Sumptus, quos fecisti in ea, quam animo aequo tuli?
Egi atque oravi tecum uxorem ut duceres,

Quae tum obsecutus mihi, fecisti ut decuerat,
Nunc animum rursum ad meretricem induxisti tuum:
Cui tu obsequutus facis huic adeo injuriam,
Nam in eandem vitam te revolutum denuo


Pam. Mean?

Lach. Teipsum. Et facis injuriam
Cum fingis falsas causas ad discordiam,
Uttu cum illa vivas, testem hanc cum abs te amoveris.
Sensitque adeo uxor; nam ei causa alia quae fuit,
Quamobrem abs te abiret?

Ph. Plane hic divinat: id est.

Pam.

Lach. Ha,
Reduc uxorem, aut quamobrem non opus sit, cedo.

Pam. Non est nunc tempus.

Lach. Puerum accipias, nam is quide^
In culpa non est; post de matre videro.

Pam. Omnibus modis miser sum; nec quid agam, scio.

Abibo hinc, praesens quando promoveo parum.
Nam puerum injussu credo non tollent meo^
Praesertim in ea re cum sit mihi adjutrix socrus.

Lach. Fugis? hem, nec quicquam certi respondes mihi?

Puerum, Phidippe, mihi cedo, ego alam.

Ph. Maxume.
Non mirum fecit uxor mea, si hoc aegre tulit:
Amarae mulieres sunt, non facile haec^erunt.
Propterea haec ira est, nam ipsa narravit mihi:

Neque illi credebam primo; nunc vero palam est;
Nam omnino abhor^ere animum huic video a nuptiis.

Lach. Quid ergo agam, Phidippe? quid das consilii?

Ph. Quid agas? meretricem hanc primum adeunda^ censeo.
Oremus, accusemus, gratius denique minitemur
Si cum illo habuerit rem postea.

La. Faciam ut mones; eho puer, curre ad Bacchidem hanc
Vicinam nostram; huc evoca verbis meis.
Et te oro porro in hac re adjutor ut sis mihi.

Ph. Ah,

Manner affinitatem hanc inter nos volo,
Si ullo modo est, ut possit, quod spero fore.
Sed visne me adesse una, dum istam convenis?

La. Immo abi, aliquam puero nutricem para.

BACCHIS. LACHES. Bac. THis is not for nothing, that Laches desires not to
speak with me,
And truly I am not much mistaken, but it is that which I suspect what he
would.

Lach. I must have a care, l^st I obtain less through anger, then I may^
And that I do nothing more, which may afterward be better for me not to have
done.
Bacchis, God save you.

B. God save you,

L. ches:

La. Truly: Bacchis,
I believe you somewhat marvail what the matter is, wherefore I commanded the
boy
To call you out of doors hither.

Bac. I am indeed also fearful, when I remember
Who I am, left the report of gain should prejudice me with you. For
I can easily justify my conditions.

La. If you say true, I will do you no harm, woman,

Wherefore I do the more warily consider every thing, that I may do nothing
rashly.
For if now you do, or are likely to do, that which it becomes honest women to
do,
It were unjust for me unwittinglie to offer you a wrong who do not deserve it.

Ba. Truly it is great thanks that I give you for this matter.

But what is the matter?

La. You entertain my son Pamphilus to your house.

Ba. Alas.

La. Let me speak. Before he married this wife, I bore with your love.
Tarry, I have not yet said what I would: he now has a wife,
Seek for your self another and surer friend, whilst you have time to consult.


Ba. Who says it?

La. His mother in law.

Ba. That I entertain him?

La. That you your self do it, and she has had away her daughter;
And would for that reason have privilie made away the child, which is born.

Ba. If I knew any other thing, whereby I might make you believe me,
More holy then an oath, I would assure you, Laches,


La. You are a lovelie woman, but do you know what I would rather have you do?

Ba. Tell me, what would you have?

La. That you go in hither to the women, and there offer that same oath to them:
Satisfy their minds, and acquit your self of this fault.

Ba. I will do it, but if indeed it were another of this trade, she would not
do it, I know;

But I am loath to have your son suspected on a false report,
Or to se^m without cause more inconstant to you, who ought not to think him so;
For he has deserved of me, that I should pleasure him, ^l I can.

La. Your discourse has made us favorable and well willing (...) toward you,

Now seeing I have found you to be otherwise then we thought you were,
See you be the same woman you were, and further make use of our friendship as
you please.
If yo do otherwise -- But I will refrain my self, that you may not hear any
thing unkindly from me.
But this one thing I advise you, that you would rather (...) what (...) friend
I may be,


Ba. I will do my utmost.

BACCHIS. LACHES. Ba. NOn hoc de nihilo est, quod Laches me nunc contentam esse
expetit.
Nec pol me multum fallit, quin sit, quod suspicor quid velit.

La. Videndum est, ne minus propter iram impetrem quam possim,
Aut ne quid faciam plus, quod me post minus fecisse satius sit.


Ba. Salve, Laches.

La. Credo aedipol
Te nonnihil mirari Bacchis, quid sit quapropter te huc soras puerum
Evocare jussi.

Ba. Ego pol quoque timida sum, cum venit mihi
Inmentem quae sum, ne nomen mihi quaestus obstet apud te; nam mores
Facile tutor.

La. Si vera dicis, nihil tibi est a me pericli, mulier.

Quo magis res omnes cautius, n^ temere faciam, accuro:
Nam si id nunc facis, facturave es, bonas quod par est facere,
Inscitum offerre injuriam me tibi immerenti iniquum est.

Ba. Est magna ecastor gratia de hac re quam tibi habeam,

Sed quid istuc est?

La. Meum receptas filium ad te Pamphilum.

Ba. Ah.

La. Sine dicam, Uxorem priusquam hanc duxit, vestrum amorem pertuli.
Mane: nondum etiam dixi hoc quod volui; hic nunc uxorem habet,
Quaere alium tibi firmiorem amicum, dum tempus consulendi est.


Ba. Quis id ait?

La. Socrus.

Ba. Mean?

La. Teipsam, and filiam abduxit suam,
Puerumque ob eam rem clam voluit, natus qui est, extinguere.

Ba. Aliud si scirem, qui firmare meam apud vos possem fidem,
Sanctius quam jusjurandum, id pollicerer tibi, Laches;


La. Lepida es, sed scin' quid volo potius facias?

Ba. Quid vis, cedo?

La. Eas ad mulieres huc intio, atque istuc jusjurandum idem
Polliceare illis: exple animum his, teque hoc crimine expedi.

Ba. Faciam, quod pol si esset alia ex hoc quaestu, h^d faceret, scio;

Sed nolo esse falsa fama gnatum suspectum tuum,
Nec leviorem vobis, quibus est minime aequum, viderier
Immerito: nam meritus de me est, quod queam, illi ut commodem.

La. Facilem benevolumque lingua tua me jam tibi reddidit;

Nunc cum ego te esse praeter nostram opinionem comperi,
Pac eadem ut sis, porro nostra utere amicitia ut velis.
Aliter si facis -- Sed reprimam me, ne aegre quidquam ex me audias;
Verum hoc te moneo unum, qualis sim amitus, aut quid possiem,


Ba. Faciam sedulo.

PHIDIPPUS. LACHES. BACCHIS. Ph. I Will not suffer you to want any thing from
me, but it shall be bountifully afforded, what you stand in need of,
But when you shall have eaten and drunken enough, see that the child be
filled.

La. Our sons father in law comes, I see him; he has brought a nurse for the
child.
Phidippus, Bacchis swears very devoutlie.

Ph. Is this she?

La. This is she.

Ph.

Ba. I deliver you my maids, search it out by any torment for me; you may do
it,
This matter is here in hand; I must bring it about, that his wife return
To Pamphilus: which if I do effect, the report does not i^k me,
That I alone have done that, which other whores shun to do.

La.
Have been falsely suspected by us; now let us further try this (...)man,
For if your wife shall find out that she has falsely believed accusation;
She will let go her anger; but if my son be angry for that matter,
Because his wife was brought a bed unknown to him, that is a s^ matter, this
anger will quickly be gone from him,


Ph. I wish indeed it were so.

La. Examine her, here she is: she will do what may be sufficient.

Ba. I will.

Ph. Why do you tell me these things? is it because you your self,
Laches, heard long ago,
How my mind stands concerning this matter? only satisfy their minds, that
they may believe.

La. I pray you Bacchis, that what your self have promised me, you would
perform it.

Ba.

La. Co, and satisfy their minds, that they may believe.

Ba. I go, although I know indeed, they will not abide the sight of me to day.
For a married woman is an enemy to a whore, when she is parted from her
husband.

La. But these will be your friends, when they shall know, wherefore you are
come.

Ph. But I engage to you that they will be your friends, when they shall know
the matter.


Ba. I am undone, I am ashamed of Philumena: do ye both follow me in hither.

La. What ^it that I desire rather to my self, then that which I perceive does
befall her,
That she may get favor without any hinderance to her, and do me good?
For if it be that she has now really parted Pamphilus from her,

And she will recompense him, and make us friends to her all under one.

Ph. Haeccine (...) est?

La. Haec est.

Ph.

Ba. Ancillas dedo, quolibet cruciatu per me exquire, licet,
Haec res hic agitur: Pamphilo me facere ut redeat uxor
Oportet; quod si perficio, non poenitet me famae,
Solam ^ecisse id quod aliae meretrices facere fugitant.

La.
Nobis in re ipsa invenimus: porro hanc nunc experiamur.
Nam si compererit crimini tua se uxor falso credidisse,
Missam iram faciet; sin autem est ob eam rem iratus g^tus,
Quod peperir uxor clam, id leve est, cito ab eo haec ira abscedet.


Ph. Velim quidem her^le.

La. Exquire, adest: quod satis sit faciet ipsa.

Ba. Faciam.

Ph. Quid mihi istaec narras? an quia non tute ipse audisti dudum,
De hac re animus meus ut sit, Laches? illis modo exple animum, ut credant.

La. Quaeso aedipol Bacchis, quod mihi es pollicita tute ut serves.

Ba.

La. I, atque exple animum his, ut credant.

Ba. Eo, etsi scio pol his fore meum conspectum invisum, hodie,
Nam nupta meretrici hostis est, a viro ubi segregata est.

La. At hae amicae erunt, ubi quamobrem adveneris, resciscent.

Ph. Atqui easdem amicas fore tibi promitto, rem ubi cognoverin^


Ba. Perii, pudet Philumenae me, sequimini me intro huc ambae:

La. Quid est quod mihi malim, quam quod huic intelligo evenire,
Ut gratiam ineat sine suo dispendio, and mihi prosit?
Nam si est ut haec nunc Pamphilum vere ab se segregarit,

Referetque gratiam ei, unaque opera nos sibi amicos junget.

Act. V. Scen. III.
PARMENO. BACCHIS. Par. Truly my master accounts my labor to be little worth,
Who has sent me a sleeveless errant to no purpose, where I sat idelie all
the day,
Whilst I expected Callimedes the Myconian host in the Tower;
And so whilst I sat there to day like a fool, as any one came,

(He said) I am not. But are you Callimedes? No. Have you a guest here
One Pamphilus? They all said nay, nor do I think he was any man at all.
At last truly now I was ashamed; I went away: but why do I see Bacchis
Coming out from our kinsmans? what business has she here?

Ba.

Par. Why thither?

Ba. Tell him I entreat him to come.

Par. To you?

Ba. Nay to Philumena.

Par. What is the matter?

Ba. Forbear to ask, that which nothing concerns you.

Par. Should I say
Nothing else?

Ba. Yes, that Myrrhina owned that ring


Par. I know it.
Is that such a weighty matter?

Ba. Such a weighty matter. He will be here presently, after he has heard
this from you.
But do you boyter?

Par. No indeed, for I have no such ability granted me to day,
I have so spent this whole day in running and walking up and down.

Ba. What jollitie have I brought Pamphilus to day by, my coming?

I restore him his son, who was almost lost by their means and his;
I help him to his wife again, whom he thought he should never have hereafter.
I have freed him from that for which he was suspected by his father and
Phidippus.
Thus the ring was the first occasion of the finding out these things;

As soon as it was night, puffing and blowing, without any body with him,
full of wine,
With this ring; I was afraid presently; O my Pamphilus, said I, of all love
I pray you, why are you dismayed? or whence got you this ring?
Tell me; he minded other matters, and dissembled: after I saw

The fellow confessed that he had ravished a maid, I know not whom, by the way,
And that he pulled off her ring whilst he strugled with her:
This Myrrhina owned it even now on my finger; she asked me as I had it,
Whence I got it; I tell her all these passages; thence it comes to be known,

I am glad that these so many joys are befaln him through me;
Although other where is are unwilling to this; for it is not for our profit,
That any lover should have joy in his marriage; but indeed
I will give my mind to bad dealing for lucre sake.

It falls out ill for me from the marriage; I confess it is done,
But truly I think I have done it, lest that should justly befall me;
It is but reason to bear some losses of him, from whom you have received many
benefits.

Pam. Is it true?

Par. True indeed.

Pam. I am happy, if it be so.

Par. You will find it true.

Pam. Tarry a while, I pray you; I am afraid, left I believe one thing, and

Par.

Pam. I think you said thus: that Myrrhina has found
That Bacchis has her ring.

Par. I did so.

Pam. That which I gave her long ago;
And did she bid you to tell me this? is it done so?

Par. Yes so, I say.

Pam. Who is more happy then I? and fuller also of good luck?
What should I bestow on you for this news? what? what? I know not.

Par.

Pam. What?

Par. Nothing forsooth;
For I know not what benefit there is to you, either in my message, or in my
self.

Pam. Should I suffer you to go away from me without a reward,
Who have fetched me back, being a dead man, from hells darkness to light? ab,
you think me too ungrateful.
But behold I see Bacchis stand before the door,


Ba. God save you, Pamphilus,

Pam. O Bacchis, O my Bacchis, the preserver of my life.

Ba. It is well done, and it is a pleasure to me.

Pam. You make me believe you by your doings,
And withal you keep your old grace,
That your meeting, your discourse, your coming, is always pleasant,


Ba. And you indeed keep your old w^nt and disposition,
That there is not any one man among all men alive more fair-spoken then you.

Pam. Ha, ha, he, tell you me that?

Ba. You have done well, Pamphilus, to love your wife.
For I never, that I know on, beheld her with my eyes before this day;
She looks like a very good gentlewoman.

Pam. Say true.

Ba. I swear, Pamphilus.

Pam.

Ba. Nothing.

Pam. Neither is it needful.
So be whisht. I like that this may not be done as it is in Comedies,
Where every body knows all things; those know, for whom it is meet
They should know; but they for whom it is not fitting they should know,
neither shall hear it, nor know it.

Ba. Nay verily, I will tell you, how you may more easily believe this may be
kept close.

And that you therefore was out of all suspicion with her.

Pam. It is very well.
And I hope this thing will come to pass according to our mind.

Par. Master, may I know from you what good that is that I have done you to day?
Or what that is that you are about?

Pam. You may not.

Par: Yet I guess.


Pam. You know not, Parmeno,
How much good you have done me to day, and from what great trouble you have
rid me.

Par. Yes indeed I know it, neither did I do this unwittinglie.

Pam. I know that well enough.

Any thing pass by Parmeno rashly, which is needful to be done?

Having left his son Antipho at Athens:
Chremes had closely a wife and a daughter at Lemnus,
And another wife at Athens, and a son that entirely loved
Lemnus
To Athens; she dies, and the maid alone (Chremes was absent)
Takes charge of the burial: when Antipho fell in love with her,
Having there got a sight of her, he by means of a parasite took her to wife.
Chremes being returned chafed at it^; afterward they gave
The parasite thirty pounds, that he himself might
Have her to wife: the singing-wench is bought with the ^ie.
Antipho retains his wife being owned by his uncle.

Relicto Athenis Antiphone filio;
Chremes clam habebat Lemni uxorem at filia^,
Athenis aliam conjugem, and amantem uni^e
Lemno advenit
Athenas, moritur; virgo sola (aberat Chremes)
Funus procurat: ibi eam visam Antipho
Cum amaret, opera parasiti uxorem accipit.
Chremes reversi fremere; dehinc minas
Triginta dant parasito, ut illam conjugem
Haberet ipse: argento emitut fidicina.
U^orem retinet Antipho a patruo ag^i^am.
The Prologue.
SInce the old Poet is not able to withdraw our Poet
From his endeavors, and make the man to sit idle,
He goes about by ill-words to affright him, that he may not write.
Who often says thus; that the Comedies which he made heretofore

Because he nowhere writ that a distracted young man
Saw the hind in chase, and the dogs to be in pursuit;
And that she made moan, and entreated some body to help her.
But if he understood, that when that Comedy being now long ago pleased,

He would be far less bold to censure, then he is now to censure,
And what comedies he made would please better.
Now if there be any one, who says or thinks thus,
If the old Poet had not provoked him first,

To say, unless he had some body to rail on:
Let him take this for an answer to him; that the prize
Is publicly propounded to all that profess Poetry.
He strove to drive this man from his study to starve;

If he had striven in better words, he had had good words:
Let him consider, that what he brought is paid him again.
I will now make an end of speaking of him,
Seeing he makes no end of offending concerning himself.

A new Comedy, which the Greeks call Epidicazomenos,
And the Latins name Phormio:
Because that he shall act the chiefest parts, will be Phormio
The Parasite, by whom the matter will especially be carried on.

Do your endeavor, attend patiently in silence;
That we may not have such fortune as we had
When our company was driven from their standing by a tumult,
Which standing our actors excellency, and your goodness

Prologus.
POstquam Poeta vetus Poetam non potest
Retrahere a studio, and tradere hominem in otiu^,
Maledictis deterrere, ne scribat, parat:
Qui ita dictitat; quas antehac fecit fabulas,

Quia nusquam insanum scripsit adolescentulum
Cervam videre fugere, and sectari canes;
Et eam plorare, orare ut subveniat sibi.
Quod si intelligeret, cum stetit olim nova,

Minus multo audacter, quam nunc laedit, laederet,
Et magis placerent quas fecisset fabulas.
Nunc si quis est qui hoc dicat, aut sic cogitat,
Vetus si poeta non lacessisset prior,

Quem diceret, nisi haberet cui malediceret:
Is sibi responsum hoc habeat; in medio omnibus
Palmam esse positam, qui a^tem tractant musicam.
Ille ad famem hunc ab studio studuit rejicere;

Benedictis si certasset, audisset been:
Quod ab ipso allatum est, sibi esse id relatum pute^.
De illo jam finem faciam dicundi mihi,
Peccandi cum ipse de se finem non facit.

Epidicazomenon quam vocant Comoediam
Graeci; Latini Phormionem nominant;
Quia primas parts qui aget, is erit Phormio
Parasitus, per quem res geretur maxim.

Date operam, adeste aequo animo per silentium;
Ne simili utamur fortuna atque usi sumus,
Cum per tumultum noster grex motus a loco est;
Quem actoris virtus nobis restituit lo^um,

DAVUS. D. MY special friend and countrie-man Geta
Came to me yesterday; there remained to him
A very little money of a small reckoning with me
A good while ago, that I might get it up; I have got it up, I bring it him.

A wife; I believe this present is scraped together for him.
How ill it is ordered, that they who have less,
Should always add something to them that are richer?
For that which he poor man spared with much ado inchmoal

She will snatch it all away, not considering
With what great pains it was gotten: and besides Geta
Shall be charged with another present, when his mistress is brought to bed,
And then with another, when the childe's birthday shall be kept,

The child shall be the cause of sending. But do I not see Geta?

Act. I. Scen. I.
DAVUS. D. AMicus summus meus and popularis Geta
Heri ad me venit; erat ei de ratiuncula
Jampridem apud me reliquum pauxillulum
Nummorum; id ut conficerem, confeci; affero.

Uxorem, ei credo munus hoc conraditur.
Quam inique comparatum est; hi qui minus habent,
Ut semper aliquid addant ditioribus!
Quod ille nunciatim vix de demenso suo,

Id illa universum abripiet, haud existumans
Quanto labor partum: porro autem Geta
Ferietur alio munere, ubi hera pepererit,
Porro alio autem, ubi erit puero natalis dies,

Puer causa erit mittundi. Sed videon' Getam?

Act. I. Scen. II.
GETA. DAVUS. G. IF any red-haired man shall seek me --

D. He is here at hand, say no more.

G. Oh?
But Davus I endeavored to meet you:

D. Take it, here;
It is picked money, there is the full sum, as much as I ought you.

G. I like you, and give you thanks that you have not neglected.

Dav.
If one restore a thing, he must have great thanks given him.
But why are you sad?

G. What I? You wot in what fear,
And in how great peril we are.

D. What is that?

G. You shall know,
So that you can keep it close.

D. Go your way, you fool,

You have seen in money? wherein, what advantage is it for me
To deceive you?

G. Nearken then.

D. I will do so much for you.

G. Davus, do you know Chremes our old man's elder brother?

D. What else?

G. What? do you know his son Phaedria?

D.

G. It fell out that both the old men had a journie
At one time, he into Lemnus, and our master into Sicily,
To an old acquaintance; he allured the old man by letters
Promising him almost golden mountains.

D. To him that had so much, and more then enough?

G. Say no more,


D. Oh, I should have been a King.

G. Then both the old men departing hence left me
As it were a tutor to their sons.

D. O Geta, you undertook
A heavy charge.

G. I am used to this, I know.
I remember I was left, because my God was displeased with me.

Whilst I am faithful to the old man, I have lost the use of my arms.

D. I considered those things; for it is a folly
To hit ones heels against the Prick.

G. I began to do every thing
For them, to humor them in what they would have.

D. You know how to make your market.

G. Phaedria
Out of hand got a certain minstrelless: he began to be deep in love with her;
She was servant to a most filthy hawd;
Neither had their fathers taken order, that they should have any thing to
give.
There was nothing else for them to do, but to feed their eyes,

We having little to do attended upon Phaedria.
In this school where she learned, over against the place
Was a kind of barber's shop; here commonly we used
For the most part to tarry for her, till she came home thence;
In the mean time, as we sat there, there came upon us
A young man weeping, we wondered;
We ask^ him what the matter was; Never did poverty, says he,
Seem to me such a miserable and beavie burden;
I saw even now in this street a poor maid

She was set over against her; neither was there any body with her,
Neither one that wished her well, nor acquaintance, nor kinsman,
Except a silly old woman, that might help the burial; I pitied her;
The maid her self is very fair; what needs many words?
Antipho presently,
Are you willing we should go see her? I think it meet, says another.
Let us go, bring us thither we pray you; we go, we come,
We see; the maid was fair, and that you may the rather say it,
She had nothing to help her beauty,

She was all tears, her clothes were foul, so that unless there had been a
force of grace
In her beauty, these things would have extinguished it by force.
He that loved the singing-wench, said only,
She is pretty enough. But our youngster.

D. I know already;


G. Do you know with whom? mind what it may come to;
The day after he goes on straight to the old-woman, he beseeches her;
That she would grant him the liberty on her; but she said she would not,
Neither did she do what was fitting; that she was a citizen of Athens,
A good women, born of good parents; If he would marry her,
He might do it by law, but if otherwise, she said nay.

To marry her, and be was afraid of his father that was absent.

D. Would his father, if he had returned, have given him leave?

G. What he? would he bestow on him a maid that had no portion, and


D. What became of it at last?

G. What should come of it? There is one Phormio a parasite,
An audacious fellow, who, a mischief take him.

D. What did he?

G. He gave this advice which I will tell you.
There is a law, that the fatherless and motherlesse maids should be married
To them that are next akin, and the same law enjoyneth the (...) to marry
them.
I will say you are her kins-man, and will entertain an action against you;
I will feign that I am the maid's father's friend,
We will come before the judges; I will devise all these things,
Who was her father, who who was her mother, how she is a-ki^ (...) you,

When you shall gainsay none of these things, I shall overcome to be sure.
Your father will be here, suits shall be commenced against me. What is that to
me?
She shall be ours indeed.

D. A merry bold-trick!

G. He persuaded the man, it is done; we come, we are cast;


D. What say you?

G. That which you hear.

D. O Geta,
What will become of you?

Get. Truly I know not; this one thing I know,
What fortune shall afford, we will take patiently.

D. Content.
Oh that is the duty of a man.

G. All my hope is in my self.

D. I commend you.

G. I think I must go to some spoke^n that may

If he shall do any thing, I will not entreat for him; only
Let him not add; when I am gone hence, even kill him quite out.

D. What does that Usher that loves the minstrelless?
What does he?

G. Thus, poorly.

D. He has not much.


G. No nothing, but mere hope.

D. Is his father returned, or no?

G. Not yet.

D. What?
How long do you look for the old man?

G. I know not certainly,
But I hear that a letter was brought us lately from him,
And that it was carried to the custom house men; I will go fetch it.

D. Geta.

G. That you may do well.
Boy, he, does no body come forth hither? Take it, give this to Dorcius.

GETA. DAVUS. G. SI quis me quaeret rufus --

D. Praesto est, define.

G. Oh!
At ego obviam conabar tibi,

Dave. D. Accipe, hem*
Lectum est, conveniet numerus, quantum debui.

G. Amo te, and non neglexisse, gratiam habeo.

D.
Si quis quid reddit, magna habenda gratia est.
Sed quid tu es tristis?

G. Egone? scis quo in metu, and
Quanto in periculo nos sumus?

D. Quid istuc est?

G. Scies,
Modo ut tacere possis.

D. Abi sis, insciens,

Verere ei verba credere? ubi quid mihi lucri est
Te fallere?

G. Ergo ausculta.

D. Hanc operam tibi dico.

G. Senis nostri, Dave, fratrem majorem Chremem
Nostin'?

D. Quidni?

G. Quid? Ejus gnatum Phaedriam?

D.

G. Evenit senibus ambobus simul
Iter, illi in Lemnum, ut esset, nostro in Siciliam,
Ad hospitem antiquum; is senem per epistolas
Pellerit; modo non montes auri pollicens.

D. Cui tanta erat res, and superaret?

Get. Desinas.


D. O, regem me esse oportuit.

D. Abeuntes ambo hinc tum senes, me filiis
Relinquunt quasi magistrum.

D. O Geta,
Provinciam cepisti duram.

G. Mihi usu venit hoc, scio.
Memini relinqui me Deo irato meo.

Seni fidelis dum sum, scapulas perdidi.

D. Venere in mentem mihi isthaec; namque inscitia est
Advorsum stimulum calces.

G. Cepi his omnia
Facere, obsequi quae vellent.

D. Scisti uti foro.

G.
Continuo quandam nactus est puellulam
Ci haristriam; hanc amare cepit perdite;
Ea serviebat lenoni impurissimo;
Neque, quod daretur quicquam, id cu^a^ tres:
Restabat aliud nihil, nisi oculos pascere;

Nos otiosi operam dabamus Phaedriae.
In quo haec discebat ludo, ex adverso ei loco*
Tonstrina erat quaedam; hic solebamus (...)
Plerunque eam operiri, dum inde iret do^;
Iiis nubant, and illos ducere eadem lex haec jubet.
Ego te cognatum dicam, and tibi scribam dicam,
Paternum amicum me assimilabo virginis;
Ad judices veniemus qui fuerit pater,
Quae matter, qui cognata tibi sit, omnia haec

Cum tu horum nihil refelles, vincam scilicet.
Pater aderit, mihi paratae lites. Quid mea?
Illa quidem nostra erit.

D. Joculam audaciam!

G. Persuasit homini; factum est; ventum est; vincimur;


D. Quid narras?

G. Hoc quod audis.

D. O Geta,
Quid te defuturum est?

G. Nescio hercle, unum hoc scio,
Quod fors feret. feremus aequo animo.

D. Placet.
Ehem istuc viri est officium?

G. In me omnis mihi spes est.

D. Laudo.

G. Ad precatorem abeam credo, qui mihi

Posthac si quicquam, nihil precor; tantummodo
Non addat; ubi ego hinc abiero, vel occidito.

D. Quid paedagogus ille qui citharistriam?
Quid rei gerit?

G. Sic, tenuiter.

D. Non multum habet


G. Immo nihil, nisi spem meram.

D. Pater ejus rediit an non?

G. Nondum.

D. Quid? senem
Quoad exspectatis vostrum?

G. Non certum scio;
Sed epistolam ab eo allatam esse audivi modo,
Et ad portitores esse latam: hanc petam.

D. Geta, aliud me vis?

G. Ut been sit tibi.
Puer, heus, nemon' huc prodit? Cape, da hoc Dorcio.

Act. I. Scen. III.
ANTIPHO. PHAEDRIA. A. THat the matter should come to this pass, Phaedria,
that I should be afraid of my father,
Who would have me very well provided for, when I think of his coming?
Whereas, if I had not been so inconsiderate, I might have expected him, as it
was meet.

Ph. What is the matter?

An. Do you ask, that art privy with me to so bold a prank?
Phormio's mind to persuade me to it,
And that he had not forced me being desirous thitherward, which is the
beginning of mischief;
Had I not obtained her, then it had gone heavily with me for some days,
But this daily care would not have troubled my mind.

Ph. I hear you.

An. Whilst I expect how quickly he may come, that may take srom me this
familiarity with her.

Ph.
Antipho, you are glutted with love; for truly this kind of life of yours
Is to be desired and wished; I wish I were so fairly blessed,
As that I might enjoy that which I love so long.
Now I desire to die; do you suppose the rest:

That I may not add that you have without cost got one that is honest and
well-favoured,
That you have as you desired, a wife of no ill report abroad,
You are happy, except this one thing be wanting, a mind that may bear these
things-moderatelie,
But if you had to do with that bawd that I have to deal with, then you would
perceive it.


An. But you, Phaedri^, on the contrary me thinks are fortunate,
That have power yet in your hand to advise what you desire;
To hold her, to love her, or let her go, I unhappie man am fallen into that
condition,
That I have neither power to let her go, nor liberty to keep her.

It is just he, I am afraid poor man what thing he now comes to tell me.

Act. I. Scen. III.
ANTIPHO. PHAEDRIA. An. ADeo^' rem rediisse, qui mihi consultum optime velit
esse,
Phaedria, patrem ut extimescam, ubi in mentem ejus adventus venit?
Quod ni fuissem incogitans, ita ^um exspectarem, ut par fuit.

Ph. Quid istuc est?

An. Rogitas, qui tam audacis facinoris mihi conscius sis?

Neu me cupidum eo impulisset, quod mihi principium est mali.
Non potitus essem, fuisset tum illos mihi aegre aliquot dies:
At non quotidiana haec cura angeret animum.

Ph. Audio.

An. Dum expecto, quam mox veniat, qui hanc mihi adimat consuetudinem.

P.
Amore abundas, Antipho; nam tua quidem hercle certo
Vita haec expetenda optandaque est. Ita me Diibene ament,
Ut mihi liceat tam diu quod amo frui.
Jam depacisci morte cupio: tu conjicito cae^era;

Ut ne addam, quod sine sumptu, ingenuam, liberalem nactus es;
Quod habes ut voluisti, uxorem sine mala fama palam,
Beatus es, ni unum hoc desit, animus qui modeste istae^ ferat;
Quod si tibi res cum eo lenone sit, quocum mihi est, tum sentias.


(...). At tu mihi contra nune videre fortunatus, Phaedria,
Cui de integro est potestas etiam consulendi quid velis:
Retinere, amare, amittere: ego in cum incidi infaelix locum,
Ut neque mihi vis sit amittendi, nec retinendi copia.

Is est ipsus: timeo miser quam hic mihi nunc nunciet rem.

Act. I. Scen. IV.
GETA. ANTIPHO. PHAEDRIA. G. YOu are undone, Geta, except you can quickly
find out some shift for you,
So many mischiefs on a sudden hang over you being unprovided,
Which I neither know how to avoid, nor how to get my self out of them;
For our boldness can be concealed no longer,


An. Why comes he in a chafe?

G. I have but a moment of time
For this matter. Here is my master.

An. What mischief is that?

G. Which when he shall hear, what remedy shall I find for his anger?
Should I speak? I shall incense him; should I hold my peace? I should set him
on: should I clear my self? I should lose my labor.

I pity him, I am afraid for him: he now holds me, for but for him,
I would have looked well to my self, and would have been revenged of the
old-mans anger,
I would have packed up something, and betaken my self hence to my heels
forthwith,

Ant. What running away or theeving does he provide for?

G. But where shall I find Antipho?


Ph. He names you.

An I know not
What great mischief I expect by this messenger.

Ph. Are you in your wits?

G. I will go on homeward,
There he is the most.

Ph. Let us call the fellow back.

An. Stand presently.

G. Ho, imperiously enough spoken, whosoever you are.

An. Geta, it is he himself
Whom I would meet with.

An. Tell me, I pray you, what news you bring, and if you can, dispatch in a
word.

G.

An. Speak out.

G. I saw your father just now at the port.

An. What mine?

G. Have you understood me.

An. I am undone.

Ph. What now?

An. What should I do?

Ph. What say you?

G. That I saw this man's father your uncle.

An. For what remedy can I poor man find on a sudden for this undoing?
But if my fortunes come to this Phanium, that I be parted from you,
I shall desire to live no longer.

G. Seeing then these things are so, Antipho,


An. I am not my self.

G. But now Antipho it is very needful you should be;
For if your father perceive you to be fearful, he will think
You have deserved blame.

Ph. This is true.

An. I cannot be altered.

G. What would you do, if you were to do some weightier matter?

An.

G. O Phaedria, this is nothing; you may be gone.
Why do we spend our labor in vain? but I must be gone.

Ph. And so must I truly.

An. I pray you, what if I counterfeit? is this enough?

G. You prate.

An. Look me in the face,
Is it enough thus?

G. No.

An. What if I look thus?

G. It is almost well enough.

An. What if I look thus?

G. That is enough.
Ho, hold you there: and be sure you answer word for word, like for like,


A. I know your meaning.

G. Tell him you were constrained by force against your will, by Law, by
judgment; do you understand me?
But what old man is this that I see in the further end of the streat?

An. It is he himself.
I cannot abide to be by.

G. Alas, what say you? whither go you, Antipho?
Tarry, tarry, I say.

An. I know my self, and my own offense;


Ph. Geta, what shall we do now?

G. You shall now hear his chiding, I shall be hanged, unless I be mistaken.
But that which erewhile we advised Antipho here, we must do it our selves,
Phaedria.

Ph. Away with this Must, and rather do you will me what I shall do.

G. Do you not remember what your speech was heretofore in beginning the matter,

Able to overcome, very good.

Ph. I remember it.

G. Lo, now
We have need of it, or if you can do any thing, a better and more tra^tie one.

Ph. It shall be done
With all dillgence.

G. Now do you go first to him; I will be here in ambush
Ready to make a supply, if you shall fail in any thing.

Ph. Go to then.

Act. I. Scen. IV.
GETA. ANTIPHO. PHAEDRIA. G. NUllus es, Geta, nisi ^am aliquid tibi consilium
c^l^^e reppereris,
Ita nunc imparatum subito tanta te impendent mala:
Quae neque uti devitem scio, neque quo modo me inde extraham;
Nam non potest celari nostra diutius audacia;


An. Quidnam ille commotus venit?

G. Tunc ^emporis mihi punctu^
Ad hanc rem est. Herus adest.

Ant. Quid illud mali est?

G. Quod cum audierit, quod ejus remedium inveniam i^racundiae?
Loquarne? incendam; taceam? instigem; purgem me? laterem lavem.

Ejus me miscret, ei nunc timeo; is nunc me retinet; namque absque eo esset,
Recte ego mihi vidissem, and senis essem ultus iracundiam:
Aliquid convasissem, atque hinc me conjicerem protinus in pedes.

Ant. Quam hic fugam, aut furtum parat?

G. Sed ubi Antiphonem reperiam?


Ph. Te nominat.

An. Nescio quod
Magnum hoc nuncio expecto malum.

Ph. Sanus es?

G. Domum ire pergam:
Ibi plurimum est.

Ph. Revocemus hominem.

An. Sta illico.

G. Hem, satis pro imperio, quisquis es.

An. Geta.

G. Ipse est quem volui
Obviam.

An. Cedo, quid portas, obsecro? atque id si potes verbo expedi:

G.

An. Eloquere.

G. Modo apud portum patrem.

An. Meumne?

G. Intellex^in'.

An. Occidi.

P. Hem.

An. Quid agam?

Ph. Quid ais?

G. Hujus patrem vidisse me patruum tuum.

An. Nam quod ego huic nunc subito exitio remedium inveniam miser?
Quod si eo meae fortunae redeunt, Phanium, abs te ut abstrahar,
Nulla est mihi vita expetenda.

G. Ergo istaec cum ita sint, Antipho,


An. Non sum apud me.

G. Atqui opus est nunc cum maxume ut sis, Antipho:
Nam si senserit te timidum pater esse, arbitrabitur
Commeruisse culpam.

Ph. Hoc verum est.

An. Non possum immutarier.

G. Quid faceres, si aliud quid gravius tibi nunc faciendum foret?

An.

G. Hoc nihil est Phaedria, ilicet.
Quid conterimus operam frustra? quin abeo.

Ph. Et quidem ego.

An. Obsecro, quid si assimulabo? satin' est?

G. Garris.

An. Vultum contemplamini;
Satin' sic est?

G. Non.

An. Quid si sic?

G. Propemodum.

An. Quid si sic?

G. Sat est.
Hem istuc serva: and verbum verbo, par pari ut respondeas,


An. Scio.

G. Vi coactum esse te invitum, lege, judicio: tenes?
Sed quis hic est senex quem video in ultima platea.

An. Ipsus est.
(...) possum adesse.

G. Ah, quid ais? quo a^is, Antipho?
Mane, mane, inquam.

An. Egomet me novi and peccatum meum;


Ph. Geta. Quid nunc fiet?

G. Tu jam lites audies; ego plectar pendens, nisi quid me fefellerit.
Sed quod modo h^c nos Antiphonem monuimus, id nosmetipsos facere
Oportet, Phaedria.

Ph. Aufer mihi Oportet; quin tu quid faciam
Impera.

G. Meministin' olim ut ^uerit vostra oration in re

Vincibilem, optumam.

Ph. Memini.

G. Hem, nunc
Ipsa est opus, aut si quid potes, meliore and callidiore.

Ph. Fiet
Sedulo.

G. Nunc prior adito tu; ego in insidiis hic ero
Succenturiatus, si quid deficies.

Ph. Age.

Act. II. Scen. I.
DEMIPHO. GETA. PHAEDRIA. D. Is it so at last, has Antipho married a wife
without my bidding?
And did he not fear my authority? well, I let authority go; did he not fear
my displeasure
At the least, was he not ashamed? O bold attempt, O Geta
The prompter on.

G. With much ado at last.

D. What will they say to me, or what excuse will they find?
I wonder.

G. But I have found one already, care you for something else.

D. Will they say this to me?
I did it against my will, the law constrained me, I hear and I confess it.

G. It likes me well.

D. But that he should wittinglie and holding his peace betray his cause to his
adversaries,
What did the law force him to that?

Ph. That is a hard thing to answer.

G. I will help you out with it, let him alone.

D. I know not what to do, because this has befallen me besides what I looked
for, and as a thing not to be believed,

Wherefore it behooveth all when they are most in prosperity, to think very
much
With themselves, how they can endure the misery of adversity;
Let him that returns from a strange country, always consider of dangers,
banishments, losses,
Or his sons misdemeanour, or his wives death, or his daughters sickness,

That he reckon all that as gained, whatsoever happens beyond expectation.

G. O Phaedria, it is a thing not to be believed, how far I exceed my master in
wisdom,
I have thought on all the discommodities that may come to me; that if my
master return,
I must grind continually in the bake-house; I must be beaten; I must have
shackles on;

I will reckon all that as gained, whatsoever shall happen beyond my
expectation.
But why do you forbear to go to the man, and at first to salute him kindly?

D. I see my brothers son Phaedria coming to meet me,

Ph. O my uncle, God save you.

D. God save you. But where is Antipho?

Ph.

D. I believe you; answer me this.

Ph. He is well, he is here. But are all things sufficiently according to your
mind?

D. I wish indeed they were.

Ph. What is that?

D. Do you ask, Phaedria?
You have made a good marriage here, whilst I was away.

Ph. Why, are you angry with him for that now?

G. O gallant craftsman!

D.
I had him brought me into my sight, that he may know now, that through his own
default
That gentle father of his is become a very sharp man.

Ph. But he has done nothing, uncle, for which you should be angry.

D. But ^o all things are alike, they are all of a ^eather,


Ph. It is not so.

D. This my son is in the fault, and he is here to defend his cause,
When he is in the fault, this my son is ready at hand; they help one another.

G. The old man at unawares has finely painted out their doings.

Ph. For except these things were so, you would not take his part, Phaedria.

Ph. Antipho has committed a fault against himself,
Whereby he might be less respectful of an estate or good name,
I do not plead his cause, but let him suffer what he has deserved.
But if any one perhaps presuming on his own naughty si b^ilitie,
Has laid wait for our youth,

Who do often through envy take away from a rich man,
Or for pity give to a poor man?

G. But that I know the cause, I should think this man spoke true.

D. Is there any judge, that can kn^w your just matters,

So as he has done?

Ph. He has done the duty
Of an ingenuous man, after he came to the judges,
He could not utter what he thought,
Bashfulness did so daunt him being fearful.

G.
Master, God save you: I am glad you are come safe.

D. O, good keeper, God save you, the main stay indeed of our house,
To whom I committed my son at my going hence.

G. I heard erewhile that you accuse us all

For what would you have me to do for you in this business?
The laws permit not a man that is a servant to plead.
Neither has he liberty to bear witness.

D. I let all those things pass,
Put in this too; the indiscreet young man was afraid, I grant it:

It was not necessary for him to have her, but that which the law commands,
You should have given her a portion, she should have sought another husband.
For what reason did he rather marry a woman that had nothing, and bring her
home?

G. A reason was not wanting, but money.

D. He should have taken it up


G. Somewhere or other? There is nothing more easy to be said.

D. At last, if by no other means, yet upon usurie.

G. Whoo.
You have spoken finely, if so be any body would trust him,
Whilst you are alive.

D. No. It is not like to be thus: it cannot be.
Should I suffer her being married with him one day?

Beshewed to me, or that it be shown me where he dwells.

G. You mean Phormio.

D. That the woman's defendant.

G. I will cause that he shall be here by and by.

D. Where is Antipho now?

Ph. Abroad.

D. Go your way, Phaedria, seek for him, and bring him hither.

Ph. I go,


G. You mean to Pamphila.

D. And I will step aside home hence to pray to my houshold-Gods.
Thence will I go to the market, and call some
Friends to me, who may be by at the handling this matter,
That I may not be unprovided when Phormio comes.

Act. II. Scen. I.
DEMIPHO. GETA. PHAEDRIA. D. ITane tandem uxorem duxit Antipho injuss^ meo?
Nec meum imperium? age, mitto imperium, non simultatem meam
Revereri saltem, non pudere? O facinus audax, O Geta
Monitor.

G. Vix tandem.

Them. Quid mihi dicem, aut quam causam reperient,
Demiror.

G. Atqui repperi jam, aliud cura.

D. A^ hoc dicent mihi?
Invitus feci, lex coegit'; audio, and fateor.

G. Placet.

D. Verum scientem, tacitum causam tradere adversariis,
Etiamne id lex coegit?

Ph. Illud durum.

G. Ego expediam, sine.

D. Incertum est quid agam, quia praeter spem atque incredibile hoc mihi
obtigit,

Quamobrem omnes, cum secundae res sunt maxume, tum maxume
Meditari secum oportet, quo pacto advorsam aerumnam serant:
Pericula, exilia, damna, peregre redien^ semper cogit^t,
Aut filii peccatum, aut uxoris mortem, aut morbum filiae;

Quidquid praeter spem evenit, omne id deputare esse in lucro.

G. O Phaedria, incredile est, quanta herum anteo sapientia,
Meditata sunt mihi omnia mea incommoda: herus si redierit,
Molendum esse usque in pistrino; vapulandum: habendae compedes:

Quicquid praeter spem evenie^, omne id deputabo esse in lucro.
Sed quid cessas hominem adire, and blande in principio alloqui?

D. Phaedriam mei fratris video filium mihi ire obviam.

Ph. Mi patrue, salve.

Them. Salve; sed ubi est Antipho?

Ph.

Them. Credo: responde hoc mihi.

Ph. Valet; hic est. Sed satin' omnia ex sententia?

D. Vellem quidem.

Ph. Quid istuc est?

D. Rogitas, Phaedria? Bo^s, me absente, hic confecistis nuptias.

Ph. Eho, an id succenses nunc illi?

G. O artificem probum!

D.
Dari mihi in conspectum, nunc sua culpa ut sciat
Lenem patrem illum factum esse acerrimum.

Ph. Atqui nihil fecit, patrue, quod succenseas.

D. Ecce autem similia omnia, omnes congruunt,


Ph. Haud ita est.

D. Hic in noxia est, ille ad defendendam causam adest.
Cum ille est, hic praesto est; tradunt operas mutuas.

G. Probe horum facta imprudens depinxit senex.

D. Nam ni haec ita essent, cum illo haud stares, Phaedria.

Ph. Antipho in se admiserit,
Ex qua re minus rei foret aut famae temperans,
Non causam dico, quin quod meritus sit, ferat.
Sed si quis forte, malitia fretus sua,
Insidias nostrae fe^it adolescentiae,

Qui saepe propter invidiam adimunt diviti,
Aut propter misericordiam addunt pauperi?

G. Ni nossem causam crederem vera hunc loqui,

D. An quisquam judex est, qui possit noscere

Ita ut ille fecit?

Ph. Functus adolescentuli est
Officium liberalis, postquam ad judices
Ventum est, non potuit cogitata proloqui.
Ita eum tum timidum obstupefecit pudor.

G.
Here, salve: salvum te advenisse gaudeo.

D. Oh, bono custos, salve, columen vero familiae.
Cui commendavi filium hinc abiens meum.

G. Jamdudum te omnes nos accusare audio

Nam quid me in hac re facere voluist^ tibi?
Servum hominem causam dicere leges non sinunt,
Neque testimonii dictio est.

D. Mitto omnia.
Add istuc, imprudens timuit adolescens, sino:

Non fuit necesse habere, sed id quod lex jubet,
Dotem daretis, quaereret alium virum.
Qua ratione inopem potius ducebat ad domum?

G. Non ratio, verum argentum deerat.

D. Sumeret


G. Alicunde? nihil est dictu facilius.

D. Postremo, si nullo alio pacto, vel faenore.

G. Hui,
Dixti pulcre, siquidem quisquam crederet
Te vivo.

D. Non, non sic futurum est, non potest.
Egone illam cum illo ut patiar nuptam unum diem?

Mihi istum volo, aut ubi habitat demonstrarier.

G. Nempe Phormionem.

D. Istum patronum mulieris.

G. Jam faxo aderit.

D. Antipho ubi nunc est?

Ph. Foris.

D. Abi, Phaedria, eum require, atque adduce huc.

Ph. Eo,


G. Nempe ad Pamphilam.

D. At ego Deos penates hinc salutatum domum divortar.
Inde ibo ad forum, atque aliquot mihi
Amicos advocabo, ad h^nc rem qui adsient,
Ut ne imparatus sim cum adveniat Phormio.

Act. II. Scen. II.
PHORMIO. GETA. Ph. SAy you so, that ^e being afraid of the sight of his
father, went hence away?

G. He was very much afraid.

Ph. And that Phanium was left alone.

G. Yes.

Ph. And that the old man was angry?

G. Very greatly.

Ph. The weight of the business is laid upon thee only, Phormio,
Thou thy self have stamped this, you must eat it up: buckle to thy work.

G.

Ph. If he shall ask?

G. My hope is in thee.

Ph. Behold the matter,
What if he shall restore her?

G. You forced him to her.

Ph. So I think.

G. Help us.

Ph. Give me the old man, now all my devises are fitted in my mind.

G. What will you do?

Ph. What would you have me to do, but that Phanium may tarry, and that I may
acquit
Antipho of this fault, and derive all his fathers anger upon my self.

G. Phormio, I am often in fear of this,
Lest this strengh of your sinews break at last.

Ph. Tush,
It is not so, I have made trial: I know which way to shift already,
How many m^n do you think now I have beaten almost to death,
Strangers? then Citizens? the better I knew them, so much the oftener I beat
them.


G. Why that?

Ph. Because the net is not laid for the hawk, and the kite,
That do harm to us, but it is spread for those that do us no harm;
Because in these there is profit, in those we fool away our pains.
Others are in danger from others, from whom something may be gotten:

They will not maintain a greedy fellow: and they are wise in my judgment,
If they will not do a main good turn for an ill turn.

G. Thanks can never be given sufficiently according to your desert.

Ph. Nay indeed no man requites his King sufficiently according to his deserts.

Having your heart at ease, when he is spent both with care and co^^;
Whilst you have what delights you, he is fretted; you may laugh,
You may drink first, you may sit down first; a doubtful supper is set before
you.

G. What word is that?

Ph. Where you may doubt, what you should take first.

To him that bestows them, would not you account him altogether? God at hand.

G. The old man is here; have a care what you do; the first brunt is very
sharp,
If you can abide it, after it, you may play as you please.

Act. II. Scen. II.
PHORMIO. GETA. P. ITane patris ais conspectum veritum hinc abiisse.

G. Admodum.

Ph. Phanium relictam solam?

G. Sic.

Ph. Et iratum senem?

G. Oppido.

Ph. Ad te summa solum Phormio rerum redit.
Tute hoc intristi, tibi omne est exedendum: accingere.

G.

Ph. Si rogitabit.

G. In te spes est.

Ph. Eccere.
Quid si reddet?

G. Tu impulisti.

Ph. Sic opinor.

G. Subveni.

Ph. Cedo senem: jam mihi instructa sunt cord consilia omnia.

G. Quid ages?

Ph. Quid vis? nisi ut maneat Phanium, atque a crimine hoc
Antiphonem eripiam, atque omnem in me iram derivem patris?

G. Phormio.
Vereor, ne isthaec fortitudo nervorum erumpat denique.

Ph. Ah,
Non ita est, factum est periculum; jam pedum visa est via.
Quot me censes homines jam deverberasse usque ad necem,
Hospites? tum cives? quo magis novi, tanto saepius.


G. Quid isthuc?

Ph. Quia non rete accipitri tenditur, neque milvo,
Qui male faciunt nobis, illis qui nihil faciunt tenditur.
Quia enim in illis fructus est, in illis opera luditur.
Aliis aliunde est periculum, unde aliquid abradi potest:

Alere nolunt hominem adacem: and sapiunt mea quidem sententia,
Pro maleficio si beneficium summum nolunt reddere.

G. Non potest satis pro merito ab illo tibi referri gratia.

Ph. Imo enim nemo satis pro merito gratiam regi refert.

Otiosum ab animo, cum ille and cura and sumptu absumitur;
Dum tibi sit quod placeat, ille ringitur; tu rideas,
Prior bibas, prior decumbas: coena dubia adponitur.

G. Quid istuc verbi est?

Ph. Ubi tu dubites quid sumas potissimum.

Ea qui praebeat, number tu hunc habeas plane praesentem Deum?

G. Senex adest, vide quid agas: prima coitio est acer^ima.
Si eam sustinueris, post illam, jam ut lubet, ludas licet.

Act. II. Scen. III.
DEMIPHO. PHORMIO. GETA. D. Lo! have you ever heard, that an injury was ever
done
More despitefullie to any man, then is done to me?
Come ye hither, I pray you.

G. He is angry.

Ph. But will you mind this business.
I will vex him by and by. O monstrous strange!
Demipho deny Phanium to be a kin to him?
Does Demipho deny this woman to be a kin to him?

G. He does deny it

Ph. And does he say that he knew not her father, who he was?

G. He says, not.

D. I think this is he, of whom I spoke, follow ye me.

Ph. And does he say, he knew not Stilpho, who he was?

G. He says, not.

Ph.
She is neglected; See, what covetousness does.

G. If you shall accuse my master of that is naught, I will tell you your name.

D. O the boldness of a fellow, what does he come of his own accord to accuse
me?

P. For now there is no cause why I should be angry with the young man,

And poor; one that got his living by his labor, he kept himself
Commonly in the country, there he had ground of my father
To till; in the meantime the old man did oftentimes
Tell me, that his kinsman neglected him:


G. See how you commend him and your self.

Ph. Get you gone and be hanged.
For unless I thought him to be such a one, I would never procure such heavy
displeasure
For this woman's sake against our family,
Which he now scorneth so dishonestlie.

G.

Ph. But he deserves this.

G. Say you so, you goal-bird.

D. Geta.

G. You extortioner of goods, you wrester of laws.

D. Geta.

Ph. Answer him.

G. What man is this, ho?

D. Hold your tongue.

G. Demipho,
He has never ceased to give out railing speeches,

Against you when you were absent.

D. Give over.
Young Man, first of all I desire this of you by your good leave,
If it may please you to make me an answer.
What friend of yours do you say that man was? make it plain to me.


Ph. You fish it out so, as if you did not know him.

D. Did I know him?

Ph. Yes.

D. But I say I did not: do you that say I knew him, bring him to my
remembrance.

Ph. Ho! did not you know your cousin-german?

D. You kill me quite out.
Tell me his name.

Ph. His name? yes.

D. Why do you now hold your peace?

Ph.

D. Ho. what do you say?

Ph. Geta,
If you remember that which I once told you, put me in mind. Ho,
I will not tell you, as though you did not know you come to pump me.

D. Do I pump you?

G. Stilpho.

Ph. And indeed what is it to me?
It is Stilpho.

D. Whom did you mention?

Ph. I say, did not you know Stilpho?

D.
A kin to me.

Ph. What so? are you not ashamed of these things?
But if he had left an estate of ten talents.

D. A mischief light on thee.

Ph. You would be the first man
To reckon your pedigree by heart as far as your grandfather and
greatgrandfather.

D.
How she had been my kinswoman.

G. Ho! our master, well done; ho you! look to your self.

Ph. I made it clear to the judges, to whom I ought,
If then it had been false, why did not your fon
Refute it?

D. Do you tell me of my son?


Ph. But you, that are a wise man, go to the magistrates;
That they may give you a sentence again of the same matter.
Forasmuch as you alone bear sway, and it is lawful for you only,
To get a judgment twice here concerning the same case.

D.
Rather then I would follow suitors, or rather then I would hear you,
Just as she were my kinswoman, because the law enjoineth,
To give her a portion, have her away, and take five pounds.

Ph. Ha, ha, he, a merry world!

D. What is the matter? do I desire any thing that is not fair?


Ph. Is it so forsooth I pray you, when you have abused her, like a whore,
Does the law bid you give her a reward and let her go?
Or, that being a citizen she might not commit any lewdness
Through want of means, is she commanded to be given to her next kinsman,


D. Yes indeed, to the next kinsman: but whence are we? or wherefore?

Ph. Enough.
Do not try a suit, they say, when a judgment is passed.

D. Should I not try? nay, I will not give over,
Till I have brought this matter to an end.

D. You play the fool.

P. Do but let me alone.

Ph. Lastly Demipho, we have nothing to do with you,

For marrying was past already.

D. Suppose him
To say all these things that I have now said;
Or else truly I will forbid him my house with this wife of his.

G. He is angry.

Ph. You your self will do better then so.

D.
You unhappie wretch.

Ph. He is afraid of us, although he dissembleth it
All that he can.

G. You have made a good beginning.

Ph. But you must suffer
What is to be suffered; you should do as is meet for you to do,
That we may be friends betwixt our selves.

D. Should I crave


Ph. If you will agree with her, you shall have one
To delight your old age: consider your own age.

D. Let her delight you: have her to your self.

Ph. Assuage your anger.

D. Mind this.
There have been now words enough; unless you make haste
Phormio.

Ph. If you lay a hand on her, otherwise then is fitting for a freeborn woman,
I will bring a huge action against you, I have told you my mind, Demipho.
If there shall be any need, ho, you shall find me at home.

G. I understand you.

Act. II. Scen. III.
DEMIPHO. PHORMIO. GETA. D. EN! unquam cuiquam contumeliosius
Audistis factam injuriam, quam est mihi?
Adeste, quaeso.

G. Iratus est.

Ph. Quin tu hoc ages?
Jam ego hunc agitabo. Proh Deum immortaliu^ fide^!
Phanium hanc sibi esse cognatam Demipho!
Hanc Demipho negat esse cognatam?

G. Negat.

P. Neque ejus patrem se site, qui fuerit?

G. Negat.

D. Ipsum esse opinor de quo agebam, sequimini.

P. Neque Stilphonem scire, qui fuerit?

G. Negat.

Ph.
Negligitur ipsa; vide avaritia quid facit.

G. Si herum insimulabis malitiae, male audies.

D. O audaciam! etiamne ultro accusatum ad ^enit.

Ph. Nam iam adolescenti nihil est quod succenseam,

Pauper, cui in opere vita erat, ruri fere
Se continebat: ibi agrum de nostro parente
Colendum habebat: saepe interea mihi senex
Narrabat, se hunc negligere cognatum suum.


G. Videas te atque illum ut narras.

Ph. Abi hinc in malam crucem.
Nam ni ita eum existumassem, nunquam tam graves
Ob hanc inimicitias caperem in nostram familiam,
Quam is aspernatur nunc tam inliberaliter.

G.

P. Dignum autem hoc illo est.

G. Ain' tandem, carcer?

D. Geta.

G. Bonorum extortor, legum contortor.

D. Geta.

P. Responde.

G. Quis homo est? ehem.

D. Tace.

G. Absenti tibi
Te indignas, seque dignas contumelias
Demipho.

D. Desine.
Adolescens, primum abs te hoc bona venia expeto,
Si tibi placere potis est, mihi ut respondeas.
Quem amicum tuum ais fuisse istum? explana mihi?


Ph. Proinde expiscare, quasi non nosses.

D. Nossem?

Ph. Ita.

D. Ergo me nego; tu qui ais redige in memoriam.

Ph. Eho tu sobrinum tuum non noras?

D. Enecas.
Dic nomen.

Ph. Nomen? maxume.

D. Quid nunc taces?

Ph.

D. Hem, quid ais?

Ph. Geta,
Si memiuisti id quod olim dictum est, subjice. Hem,
Non dico, quasi non noris, tentatum advenis.

D. Egon' autem tento?

G. Stilpho.

Ph. Atque adeo quid mea?
Stilpho est.

D. Quem dixti?

P. Stilphonem, inquam, non noras

D.
Quisquam isto nomine.

Ph. Itane? non te horum pudet?
At si talentum rem reliquisset december.

D. Dii tibi male faciant.

Ph. Primus esses memoriter
Progeniem vestram usque ab avo atque atavo proferens.

D.
Cognata esset ea dicerem: itidem tu face.
Cedo, qui est cognata?

G. Heus noster recte; heus tu, cave.

Ph. Dilucide expedivi, quibus me oportuit
Judicibus; tum id si falsum fuerat, filius


D. Filium narras mihi?
Cujus de stultitia dici, ut dignum est, non potest.

Ph. At tu, qui sapiens es, magistratus adi:
Judicium de eadem causa reddant tibi.
Quandoquidem solus regnas, and soli licet
Hic de eadem causa bis judicium adipiscier.


Potius quam lites secter, aut quam te audiam,
Itidem ut cognata si sit, id quod lex jubet
Dotem dare, abduce hanc, minas quinque accipe.

P. Ha, ha, he, homo suavis!

D. Quid est? number iniquum postulo?


Ph. Itane tandem, quaeso, item meretricem ubi abusus sis illam,
Mercedem dare lex jubet ei, atque amittere;
An, ut ne quid civis turpe in se admitteret,
Propter egestatem, proximo jussa est, dari,


D. Ita proxumo quidem; at nos unde, aut quamobrem:

Ph. Ohe,
Actum, aiunt, ne agas.

D. Non agam? immo haud desinam,
Donec perfecero hoc.

Ph. Ineptis.

D. Sine modo.

Ph. Postremo tecum nihil rei nobis, Demipho, est,

Praeterierat jam ad ducendum aetas.

D. Omnia haec
Illum putato quae ego nunc dico dicere:
Aut quidem cum uxore hac ipsum prohibebo domo.

G. Iratus est.

Ph. Tute idem melius feceris.

D.
Infelix.

Ph. Metuit hic nos tametsi sedulo
Diffimulat.

G. Been habent tibi principia.

P. Quin quod est
Ferendum feras: tuis dignum factis feceris,
Ut amici inter nos simus.

D. Egon' tuam expetam


Ph. Si concordabis cum illa, habebis quae tuam
Senectutem oblectet; respice aetatem tuam.

D. Te oblectet: tibi habe.

Ph. Minue vero iram.

D. Hoc age.
Satis jam verborum est: nisi tu properes mulierem
Phormio.

Ph. Si illam attigeris secus quam dignum est, liberam:
Dicam tibiimpingam grandem. Dixi, Demipho.
Si quid opus fuerit, heus domi me.

G. Intelligo.

DEMIPHO. GETA. CRATINUS. HEGIO. D. WHat care and trouble has my son brought
upon me?
Who has entangled me and himself by this marriage?
Neither does he come forth into my sight, that I may know at least,
What he can say concerning this matter, or what his mind is.


G. I go.

D. Ye see in what state this matter stands.
What should I do? tell me, Hegio.

H. I think Cratinus had best tell you,
If you think good.

D. Tell me, Cratinus.

C. Would you have me tell you?

D. Yes you.
I would have you do those things, which may be for your own good* this is

Whilst you was away, be restored to it is former estate,
And this you will obtain. I have spoken my mind.

D. Now speak you, Hegio.

H. I think he has truly spoken his mind: but thus it is,
So many men, so many minds: every one has his own way.

Can be revoked; and it is an uglie thing to go about it.

D. Speak, Crito.

Cr. I think it is to be deliberated more on.
It is a weighty matter.

H. Will you have any thing else with us?

D. Ye have done very well,
I am much more uncertain, then I was erewhile.

G. They say he is not


D. I must wait for my brother;
What advice he shall give me, I will follow it.
I will go ask for him at the port, until he come back.

G. But I seek Antipho, that he may know, what things are done here.
But behold I see him coming hither in good time.

Act. II. Scen. IV.
DEMIPHO. GETA. CRATINUS. HEGIO. D. QUanta me cura and sollicitudine affecit
Gnatus, qui me and se hisce impedivit nuptiis?
Neque mihi in conspectum prodit, ut saltem sciam,
Quid de hac re dicat, quidve sit sententia.


G. Eo.

D. Videtis quo in loco res haecsict.
Quid ago? dic, Hegio,

H. Ego Cratinum censeo,
Si tibi videtur.

D. Dic, Cratine.

C. Mean vis?

D. Te.
Ego quae in rem tuam sint, ea velim facias: mihi

Egit; restitui in integrum aequum ac bonum est.
Et id impetrabis. Dixi.

D. Dic nunc Hegio.

H. Ego sedulo hunc dixisse credo; verum ita est,
Quot homines* tot sententiae; suus cuique mos est.

Rescindi posse, and turpe inceptum est.

D. Dic Crito.

Cr. Ego amplius deliberandum censeo,
Res magna est.

H. Numquid nos vis?

D. Fecistis probe,
Incertior sum multo quam dudum.

G. Negant


D. Frater est expectandus mihi;
Is quod mihi dederit de hac reconsilium id exsequar.
Percontatum ibo ad portum, quoad sefe recipiat.

G. Atque Antiphonem quaeram, ut quae acta hic sint, sciat.
Sed eccum ipsum video in tempore huc se recipere.

Act. III. Scen. I.
ANTIPHO. GETA. An. Truly, Antipho, you are much to be discommended with that
faint heart,
That you should thus go away hence, and commit your life to others to be
preserved?
Did you think other men would better mind your business then your self?
For however other things were, you might surely have consulted for her, who is
now at your house,

Which poor woman's hopes and riches do all depend upon you alone.

G. Truly, master, we blamed you here even now, in your absence, because you
went away.

An. I was looking for you.

G. But we failed never the more for that reason.

A. Speak, I pray you, in what state do my matters and fortunes stand?


G. Nothing at all.

A. Is there any further hope?

G. I know not.

A. Alas.

G. But that Phaedria did not cease to labor for you.

A. He has no new thing.

G. Besides Phormio in this, as in other matters,
Showed himself a stout man.

A. What did he?

G. He confuted
Your father that was very angry with words.

A. O brave Phormio!

G.

A. O my Geta, I love you all.

G. Thus the entrance is made, as I tell you: the matter is yet in quiet;
And your father will tarry for your uncle, until he come hither.

A. Why will he tarry for him?

G. As he said, he would do according to his advice in that which
Belongs this business.

A. Geta, How greatly am I afraid that my uncle

Or die according to his sentence.

G. Here is Phaedria for you.

A. Where?

G. Look where he is, he comes forth out of his own wrestling-school doors.

Act. III. Scen. I.
ANTIPHO. GETA. An. ENimvero, Antipho, multis modis, cum istoc animo
vituperandus es,
Itane te hinc abiisse, and vitam tuam tutandam aliis dedisse?
Alios tuam rem credidisti, magis quam tete animadversuros?
Nam utut erant alia, illi certe, quae nunc tuae domi est, consuleres.

Cujus nunc miserae spes opesque sunt in te uno omnes sitae.

G. Equidem, here, nos jam dudum hic te absentem incusamus, qui abieris.

A. Teipsum quaerebam.

G. Sed ea causa nihilo magis defecimus.

A. Loquere, obsecro, quonam in loco sint res and fortunae meae?


G. Nihil etiam.

A. Ecquid sp^i porro est?

G. Nescio.

A. Ah.

G. Nisi Phaedria haud cessavit pro te eniti.

A. Nihil secit novi.

G. Tum Phormio itidem hac re, ut in aliis,
Strenuum hominem praebuit.

A. Quid is fecit?

G. Confutavit
Verbis admodum iratum patrem.

A. Eheu Phormio!

G.

A. Mi Geta, omnes vos amo.

G. Sic habent principia sese, ut dico: adhuc tranquilla res est;
Mansurusque patruum est pater, dum huc adveniat.

A. Quid eum?

G. Ut aiebant, de ejus consilio sese velle facere quod ad hanc
Rem attinet.

A. Quantus metus est mihi, venire huc nunc
Geta! Nam per ejus una^, ut audio, aut vi^a^
Aut moria^, sententiam.

G. Phaedria tibi adest.

A. Ubinan^

G. Eccum, ab sua palestra exit for as.

PHAEDRIA. DORIO. ANTIPHO. GETA. Ph. DOrio, I pray you, hear me.

D. I do not hear you.

Ph. A little while.

D. But let me alone.

Ph. Hear what I will say.

D. But it irketh me now to hear the same things a thousand times.

Ph. But now I will say what you will willingly hear.

D. Speak, I hear you.

Ph. Cannot I entreat you to tarry this three days? whither go you now?

D.

A. Alas I fear the bawd should devise some mischief to his overthrow.

G. I fear the same.

Ph. Do thou not believe me?

D. Guess.

Ph. But if I pawn my credit.

D. These are but tales.

Ph. You will say that you got well by that good turn.

D. These are but words.

Ph. Believe me, you will be glad when it is done: verily this is true.

D. These are but dreams.

Ph.

D. You sing the same song.

Ph. You shall be my cousin, you my parent, you my friend.

D. Prate* on now.

Ph. That you should be of such a hard and inexorable a nature,
That you can neither be softened by pity, or prayers!

D. That you should be so inconsiderate and indiscreet, Phaedria,


A. He pitties him.

Ph. Alas, I am confuted with your words.

G. How like either party is to himself!

P. And that this evil should then befall me,
When Antipho was busied with some other care.

A. Aias, but what is that, Phaedria?

Ph. O most fortunate Antipho!

A. What I?

Ph. Who have that at home, which you love.


A. Have I at home? nay, as they say, I hold a wolf by the ears,
For neither can I devise, how to send her away, nor do I know how to keep her.

D. My case is the very same about this man.

A. Soft, be not too cheap a bawd.
Has he done any thing for you?

Ph. What he? that which a most discourteous fellow would do.
Pamphila.

G. What has he sold her?

A. Say, you, he has sold her?

Ph. He has sold her.

D. What an unworthie act was it, to sell a maid that was bought with his own
money?

Ph. I cannot entreat him that he would tarry, and alter his promise with the
man,
This three days, whilst I get the money which is promised by my friends.
If I give it you not then, do not stay for me one hour longer.

D.

A. That which he entreats, Dorio, is not long: let him over-intreat you.
He shall doubly requite you this, which you shall well deserve.

D. These are but words.

A. Will you suffer Pamphila to be deprived of this city?
And besides can you be able to endure their love to be pulled asunder?

D. Neither can I nor you suffer it.

G. God reward you according to your deserts.

Promising, and bringing nothing, lamenting; now on the other side,
I have found one that will give all things, and not weep; give place to your
betters.

A. In very truth, if I well remember, there was heretofore a day,
On which being the set day you should have given him the money.

P. It was so.

D. Do I deny that?

An.

D. No, but this day is come before it.

An. Are you not ashamed
Of your lightness?

D. No, so it be for my profit.

G. You dughillraskal.

Ph. Dorio,
Ought you to do so I pray you?

D. This is my quality, if you please, make use of me.

An. Do you so deceive this man?

D. Nay rather, Antip^o, this man deceives me.
For he knew I was such a one. I thought him to be otherwise;

But however these things are, yet this will I do; to morrow morning the
soldier said
He would give me the money; if you Phaedria, will bring it me the first,
I will make use of my own law, that he shall be the better chapman that pays
me the first. Farewell.

Tum hoc mihi esse objectum malum.

Si non tum dedero, unam praeterea horam ne opertus s^es.

A. Haud longum est id quod orat, Dorio: exoret, sine.
Idem hoc, tibi, quod been promericus fueris, conduplicabit.

A. Pamphulamne hac urbe privati sines?
Tum praeterea horum amorem distrahi poterin' pati?

D. Neque ego, neque tu.

D. Dii tibi id quod dignum duint.

D.
Pollicitantem, nihil serentem, flentem; nunc contra, omnia
Repperi qui det, neque lachrymet; da locum melioribus.

A. Certe hercle, ego si satis memini, tibi est olim dies
Quam ad dares huic, praestitutam.

Ph. Factum.

D. Number ego istuc nego?

A.

A. Non pudet

D. Minime, dum ob rem.

G. Sterquilinium.

P. Dorio,

D. Sic sum, si placet, utere.

A. Siccine hunc decipis?

D. Immo enimvero, Antipho, hic me decipit;
Nam hic me hujusmodi esse sciebat. Ego hunc esse aliter credidi;

Sed ut haec sunt, tamen hoc faciam: cras mane argentum mihi
Miles dare se dixit: si mihi prior tu attuleris, Phaedria,
Mea lege utar, ut potior sit qui prior ad dandum est. Vale.

PHAEDRIA. ANTIPHO. GETA. Ph. WHat should I do? whence should I poor man get
money for him on such a sudd^in,
Who have less then nothing? But if he could now have tarried
This three days, it was promised me.

A. Should we suffer this man, Geta,
To become miserable, who of late, as you told me, helped me kindly?


G. I know indeed this is but reasonable.

An. Go to then, you alone are able to save him.

G. What should I do?

A. You must get the money.

G. I desire that; but whence, teach me.

A. My father is hereby.

G. I know that, but what them?

An. Ah, a word is enough to a wiseman.

G. Is it so?

A. Yes. Truly you persuade me finely: and do you go hence too?

Except you also now command me to seek my death in doing mischief for this
man's sake?

A. He speaks truth.

Ph. What? am I, Geta, a stranger to you?

G. I. do not think it,
But is it a small matter, that the old man is now angry with us all,
Except we provoke him further, that there may be no place left for entreaty?

Ph.
Therefore whilst you may, and whilst I am here, speak with me, Antipho,
Look upon me.

An. Why so? or what are you about to do? tell me.

Ph. Into what part of the earth soever she shall be carried hence, I am
resolved to follow her, or to die.

G. God prosper what you are to do, yet go fair and softly.

An. See,


G. If I can, I will, what?

An. Devise I pray you,
Lest he should devise any thing more or less, which may afterward grieve
us, O Geta.

G. I am devising;
He is well enough, as I suppose, but indeed I fear the mischief.

An. Do not fear.
We will bear the good and bad with you.

G. How much have you need of?
Speak.

Ph. But thirty pounds.

G. Thirty! whoo! Phaedria, she it very dear.

Ph.

G. Well, well, I will get them and give you them.

Ph. Oh,
Merry fellow.

G. Get you away hence.

Ph. I have now need.

G. You shall carry
The money by and by; but I have need of Phormio to help in this matter.

An. He is at hand, be very bold to lay any burden on him, and he will bear
it; he is the only man
That is a friend.

G. Let us go to him then quickly.

Ph. Go, bid him be ready at home.

An.

G. Nothing, but go your way home,
And comfort that poor woman, whom I know to be within astonished with fear.
Do you loiter?

An. There is nothing that I will do so willingly.

Ph. What way will you do that?

G. I will tell you by the way; only get you aside hence.

Et illam miseram, quam ego nunc intus scio esse exanimatam metu,

DEMIPHO. CHREMES. D. WHat? For what reason did you go hence to Lemnus, Chremes?
Have you brought your daughter with you?

Chapter No.

D. Why have you not done so?

C. After her mother saw that I tarried here somewhat too long,
And withal that the maids age did not tarry for

With her whole family.

D. Why then I pray you,
Did you tarry there so long, after you had heard that?

C. In truth sickness held me.

D. Whence, or what was it?

C. Do you ask?
Old age it self is a disease: but I heard by the seaman


D. Have you heard, Chremes, what has happened to my son?

D. Which deed verily makes me uncertain what to resolve;
For if I should make this profer to any f^rainer,
I must tell him in order, how, and whence she is my daughter.

If that stranger be willing to have me his kinsman,
He will hold his tongue* so long as we are f^iends betwixt our selves;
But if he slight me, he shall know more then is requisite to be known.
And I am afraid lest my wife should know this some way or other,

And go forth of my house: for I alone am my own of all that I have.

D. I know it is so, and therefore that matter is a trouble to me.
Neither will I cease any time to try all ways,
Until I have effected for you that which I have promised.

Simul autem non manebat aetas virginis


D. Quid illic tamdiu Quaeso igitur commorabare, ubi id audiveras?

C. Pol me detinuit morbus.

D. Unde, aut qui?

C. Rogas?
Senectus ipsa morbus est; sed venisse eas


D. Quid gnato obtigerit audistin' Chreme?

C. Quod quidem me factum consilii incertum facit;
Nam hanc conditionem si cui tulero extrario,
Quo pacto aut unde mihi sic, dicendum ordine est.

C.
Sciebam, ille sime alienus affinem volet,
Tacebit, dum intercedit familiaritas;
Sin spreverit me, plus quam opus est scito, sciet.
Vereorque ne uxor aliqua hoc resciscat mea.

Idrestat; nam ego meorum solus sum meus.

D. Scio ita esse, and ideo istaec res mihi sollicitudini est,
Neque defetiscar unquam ego experitier
Donec tibi id quod pollicitus sum effecero.

Act. IV. Scen. II.
GETA. G. I Never knew a man more crafty
Then Phormio: I come to the man to tell him
We had need of money, and how that might be done,
I had scarce spoken the half, but he understood me.

He thanked God that a time was offered him,
Wherein he might show himself to be no less
A friend to Phaedria, then he was to Antipho. I bade the man
To tarry for me at the market, and said, I would bring the old man thither.
Phaedria's
Father comes: but why did I fear, a beast that I am?
Was it because two are offered me, whom I may deceive in stead of one?
I think it more profitable to make use of a double hope.
I will ask of him of whom I resolved from the beginning: if he give, it is
sufficient.
If nothing can be done from him, then I will set upon this stranger.

Gaudebat: me laudabat: quaerebat senem:
Diis gratias agebat, tempus sibi dari,
Ubi Phaedriae se ostenderit nihilominus
Amicum esse, quam Antiphoni. Hominem ad forum
Jussi operiri, eo me esse adducturum senem.
Sed eccum ipsum: quis est ulterior? atat, Phaedriae
Pater venit: sed quid pertimui autem bellua?
An quia quos fallam pro uno duo sunt mihi dati?
Commodius esse duco duplici spe utier.
Petam hinc unde a primo institui: si is dat, sat est.
Si ab hoc nihil fiet, tum hunc adoriar hospitem.

But I see my uncle standing with my father: woe is me,
How I am afraid whither his coming may drive my father.

G. I will go to these men, O our Chremes.

C. God save you, Geta.

G.

C. I believe.

G. What is done?

C. Many things are new to me at my coming home, as it falls out, here are a
great many new matters.

G. Yes, Have you heard concerning Antipho what was done?

C. I have heard all.

G. Had you jtold him? it is an unworthy trick, Chremes,
To be thus cosened.

D. I talked convenientlie about it with my brother.

G.
Have found a remedy for this matter, as I suppose.

D. What Geta?
What remedy?

G. As I departed from you, Phormio. by chance
Met me.

C. What Phormio?

G. He who packed this woman upon us.

C. I know him.

G. I thought good to try his mind,
Phormio, quoth I
That these things be composed betwixt you
With good will, rather then with ill will?
My master is a free-hearted man, and one that avoids suites in law:
For truly all the rest of our friends erewhile


A. What does this fellow begin, or what will he come to to day?

G. Will you say
That he shall be punished according to law, if he cast her out?
That is certainly known already: soft, you shall find work enough,
If you begin with the man, he has such a fine deliverie.

The matter in question is not concerning his life, but his money.
After I perceived the fellow was softened with these words,
We are now here alone, say I; he, tell me what would you have
To be given you in hand, that my master may let this suite fall,
That she may go away hence, and that you may not be troublesome.

A. Does God prosper him sufficiently?

G. For I know very well,
If you will but speak any piece of right and reason,
He is so good a man, you will not make three words
Today betwixt you.

D. Who commanded you to say those words?

G.
Thither whither we desire.

A. I am undone.

D. Go on to tell out your tale.

G. But at first the fellow played the madman.

D. Tell me, what does he demand?

G. What? too much, as much as he listed.

D. Tell me.

G. If any body would give it,
A great talent (i. e. fourscore and three pounds.)

D. Yea indeed a ha^ter, how he is ashamed of nothing:

G.
Not to have begot another; there one found, that can desire a portion.
That I may be short, and let go his fooleries,
This in fine was his last speech;
(...), quoth he, now from the beginning desired to marry

For I considered of her discommoditie,
That a poor woman should be given to a rich man to be made a drudge:
But I stood in need (that I may tell you the plain story)
Of one that might bring me somewhat, whereby I might pay
Demipho will just now give me as much
As I am to receive of her, which is espoused to me,
I should desire no woman to be given me to wife, sooner then her.

A. I am uncertain whether I should say this fellow does these things
Through folly, or mischievousness, witting or unadvised.

D.

G. His ground, he says, is mortgaged
For ten pounds.

D. Go to, go to, let him marry her now, I will give it him.

G. His little house is mortgaged for other ten.

D. Hui!
It is too much.

C. Do not cry out, fetch these ten from me.

G. He must buy a little maid for his wife, besides he stand^ in need

Suppose indeed for these things (says he) ten pounds.

D. Let him now likewise rather enter six hundred actions against me,
I will give him never a penni^; that the naughty knave should also mock me?

C. I pray you be content, I will give it: do but you make your son


A. Woe is me, Geta,
You have quite undone me with your fallacies.

C. She is packt out for my sake,
It is but reason that I should lose this.

G. Let me know from you, says he,
As soon as you can, if they will give me her;
That I may let this go, lest I be held in uncertainties.


C. Let him take his money by and by; let him signify to them the divorcement,
Let him marry her.

D. Which thing indeed may it never prosper with him.

C. I have now very fitly brought money with me,
The rent, which my wives farms at Lemnos yield me;

G. Truly I know not, thus much I was bidden to do.

A. Oh you whipt-rascal; you answer me another thing then I ask you.

G. What then do you say?

A. What should I say? by your means

I wish some heavy judgment may light on you
For example to others: Ho, if you would any thing,
Which you would have well done, you may commit it to this fellow,
Who may bring you out of a calm place to dash against a rock.

Or to mention a wife? my father is put in hope
That she may be thrust out. Tell me now besides if Phormio
Shall receive the portion, he must marry his wife home to him.
What shall be done?

G. But he shall not marry her.

A. I know it. But,

He will rather go to the goal.

G. There is nothing, Antipho,
But it may be corrupted by wrong telling.
You pick out that which is good, and speak that which is naught.
Hear now on the other side; if he receive the money,

A little space at last will indeed be granted
In preparing for the wedding to invite folks, and to sacrifice:
In the mean time friends will give the money which they promised,
And he shall restore it to them.

A. Wherefore? or what shall he say?

G. Do you ask?

A strange black dog came into the house,
A snake fell from the tyles through the square place where the rain falls in.
A hen crew, the wizzard forespake it;
The deviner forbad to begin any ne^ business

These things shall be done, I warrant you.
Your father comes forth, go your way, tell Phaedria that I have money for him.

Utte quidem omnes Dii, Deaeque, superi, inferi,
Malis exemplis perduint: Hem si quid velis
Huic mandes, quod quidem recte curatum velis,
Qui te ad scopusum e tranquillo inferat.

Aut nominare uxorem? injecta est spes patri
Posse illam extrudi: cedo, nunc porro Phormio
Dotem si accipiet, uxor ducenda est domum.
Quid fiet?

G. Non enim ducer.

A. No^i. Caeterum

In nervum potius ibit.

G. Nihil est, Antipho,
Quin male narrando possit depravarier:
Tu id quod boni est excerpis: dicis quod mali est.
Audi nunc contra jam; si argentum acceperit,

Spatium quidem tandem apparandis nuptiis
Vocandi, sacrificandi, dabitur paululum.
Interea amici quod polliciti sunt argentum dabunt,
Idille istis reddet,

A. Quamobrem? aut quid dicet?

G. Rogitas?

Introiit in aedes ater alienus canis,
Anguis per impluvium decidit de tegulis,
Gallina cecinit, interdixit hariolus,
Haruspex vetuit ante brumam aliquid novi

Haec fient.

A. Ut modo fiant.

G. Fient, me vide.
Pater exit, abi, dic, esse argentum, Phaedriae.

DEMIPHO. GETA. CHREMES. D. BE quiet, I say, I will have a care they do not
cozen us;
I will never let this go from me rashly, but I will take witnesses to me,
I will set down a memorandum to whom I give, and wherefore I give.

G. How wary he is, where there is no need!

C. But he has need to do so; but make haste, whilst he is in the same mind.


D. You have thought as the matter is.

D. Bring me to him then.

G. I make no delay.

C. When you have done this,
Step over to my wife, that she may speak with her, before she go hence;
Let her tell her that we will give her in marriage to Phormio, that she be not
angry.
And that he (...) a more fit match, who may be more familiar with her.

As he desired.

D. What does this concern you, with a mischief!

C. Much, Demipho.

D. Is it not enough for you to have done your duty, if fame approve it not?

C. I would have this done also with her good will, lest she should report that
she was cast out.

D: I my self can do that.

C. A woman will agree better with a woman.

D.

C. I am thinking where I may find these women.

C. Atqui ita opus est facto; at matura, dum libido eadem haec manet.


G. Rem ipsam putasti.

D. Duc me ad eum ergo.

G. Non moror.

C. Ubi hoc egeris,
Transito ad uxorem meam, ut conveniat hanc prius quam hinc abeat.
Dicat eam nos dare Phormioni nuptum: ne succenseat,
Et magis esse illum idoneum, qui ipsi sit familiarior.

D. Non sat tuum officium fecisse, si non id ^ama approbat?

SOPHRONA. CHREMES. S. WHat should I do? whom shall I find to be my friend
poor woman, or to whom
Shall I impart these purposes? or of whom should I desire help?
For I am afraid lest my mistress through my persuasion should be unworthilie
wronged.
I h^a^ the young man's father takes these things that are done so pas^ ^atelie.

C.

S. Which poverty forced me to do, when I know this was an uncertain
Marriage; that I might take that course, that our life might be preserved in
the mean time.

C. Verily, except I be mistaken, or my eyes fail me,
I see my daughters nurse.

S. Neither is he to be traced out.

C. What should I do?

S.

C. Had I best go to her or tarry, till I better know what she says?

S. But if I could but now find him, there would be nothing that I should fear.

C. It is just she,
I will speak with her.

S. Who speaks here?

C. Sophrona.

S. And does he name my name too?

C. Look back to me.

S. O strange, is this Stilpho?

C. No.

S. Do you say no?

C. Go aside hence from the door a little this way I pray you, Sophrona.


S. What I pray you, are not you he,
Whom you have always used to say you were?

C. Whisht.

S. What, are you afraid of this door?

C. I have a cursed wife pent up; but concerning that name,
I have told you wrong heretofore to that end, left you peradventure being
indiscreet
Should blab it out, and my wife also should come to know it one way or other.

S.

C. Come on, tell me, what have you to do with this family whence you come? or
where are
Those women?

S. Woe is me.

C. Ha, what is the matter? are they living?

S. Your daughter is alive:
But death has seized upon the mother for very grief.

C. This is ill done.

S. And I who was a forlorn old woman, being in want, and unknown,

Of this house.

Chapter To Antipho?

S. Ah, to himself.

Chapter What?
Has be two wives?

S. Soft, I pray you, he has indeed this one alone.

Chapter What is that other woman, which is said to be his kinswoman?

S. This is then she.

Chapter What say you?

S. It was done on purpose, how he being in love might have her


Chapter O strange! how often do these things fall out by chance unadvisedlie,
Which one dare not wish! at my coming I have found my daughter
Placed with him that I desired, and as I desired.
That which we both endeavored with a great deal of pains, that it might be
done,
This woman alone has effected without any great care of ours.

S.
And they say he takes it very impatiently.

Chapter There is no danger:
But for God's sake and man's, take heed that no body kno^w this is my
daughter.

S. No body shall know it from me.

Chapter Follow me, you shall hear the rest within.

Whilst we strive too much that we may be reputed good and kind.

D. Was not that enough,
To take wrong at his hands, but we must offer him money of cur own accord?


G. Very clearlie.

D. They are now rewarded, that make right things wrong.

G. Very truly.

D. How foolishlie now have we handled the matter with him:

G. Only I wish we could come off with this device, that he may marry her.

D. What is there any doubt of that?

G. Truly I know not, such afellow as he is, how he may alter his mind.

D.

G. I hope not, but if by chance he do, I say.

D. I will do, as my brother advised, that I may bring his wife hither,
That she may speak with her. O you Geta, go your way, tell her beforehand
that she is coming.

G. We have got money for Phaedria; not a word of the chiding.
We have provided that she may not go hence for the present; and what further?

Geta; the mischief which was present, is but prolonged to another day; your
stripes increase,
Unless you look to it beforehand. Now will I go home hence, and instruct
Phanium.
That she may not any whit be afraid of Phormio, or his discourse.

Nausistrata, see that she be friends with us;
That she may do that which must be done, of her own good will.

N. I will do it.

D. Now help me with your pains, like as heretofore you helped me with the
estate.

N. I am willing to do it, and indeed I am able to do less through my
husband's fault, then is becoming me.

D.

N. Because indeed he negligently looks after the means
Which my father got honestly. For he constantly got two talents
Of silver by the farms. Ha, how one man exceeds another!

D. Two talents, I pray you?

N. And when things were much cheaper, yet two talents.

D. Whoo!

N. What do these seem a wonder to you?

D. Yes.

N. I wish I had been born a man,


D. I know very well.

S. Which way?

D. Forbear I pray you,
That you may be able to talk with her; lest the young-woman weary you quite
out.

N. I will do as you bid me, but I see my husband come from your house.

Chapter Ho Demipho,
Is the money given him already?

D. I took order presently.

Chapter I would it had not been given. Alas, I see my wife; I had almost said more
then was enough.

D. Chtemes?

Chapter Now all is well.

D. What say you? have you spoken with her,
Why we bring this woman?

Chapter I have dispatched.

D. What says she at last?

Chapter She cannot be got away.

D. Why can she not?

Chapter Because they both love one another dearly.

D. What does that concern us?

Chapter Very much.
Besides these things, I have found her to be our kinswoman.

D. What? do you do^t?

Chapter No.


D. Are you
Well in your wits?

N. Soft, I pray you, take heed you do nothing against our kinswoman.

D. She is not our kinswoman.

Chapter Do not deny it. Her father is called by another name, herein you have
been mistaken.

D. Did not she
Know her father?

Chapter She knew him.

D. Why did she call him by another name?

Chapter You will never
Yield to me to day, neither do you understand.

D. If you tell me nothing.

S. I wonder what this is.

D. Truly I know not.

Chapter Would you fain know? verily, there is no body nearer akin to her
Then I am and you.

D. O strange! let all us go together to her,
I will know this off, or on.

Chapter Ah, ah.

D. What is the matter?

Chapter That I should have so little belief with you?

D. Would you have me believe this?
Will you have that to be sufficiently enquired by me? well, be it so: what,
she our friend's
Daughter, what will become of it?

C. Well.

D. Should (...) send this woman away?

C. What else?

D. Must that other tarry?

C. Yes.

D. You may go, Nausistrata.

N. I think indeed it is more convenient for all parties that she tarry,
Then to do as you began. For she seemed to me of a very good disposition,
when I saw her.

D. What business is here?

C. Has he shut the doors already?

D. Already.

G. O strange! we rose (...) our right side.


D. Ha, how could that be?

As, when adversity comes, you may remedy them a little!

But, if this be concealed, I am in fear; if it be discovered, I am disgraced.

I have taken order that Phaedria may enjoy her as his own: for she is set free.
Now there is yet one thing behind for me, which I must also dispatch; that I
may get
Leisure of the old men to drink: for I will spend these few days.

A. Phormio; what say you?

Ph. What?

A. What does Phaedria now mean to do?
How does he say he will have his fill of love?

Ph. He will now on the other side act your part.

A. What?

Ph. To outrun his father.
He entreated you that you would plead his cause again, and speak for him,
For he is going to tipple at my house: I will tell the old men,
Sunium to the Mart, to buy a little maid, which Geta spoke of a while ago,
Lest when they see me not here, they may think I am spending their money.
But your door creek't.

commodities
On what sudden have you loded this day to my master Ansipho through your
assistance!

A. What does he mean?

G. And you disburdened us his friends of our fear.
But do I loiter with my self, who do not load his shoulder with my cloak,


An. Do you understand what he says?

Ph. Do you?

An. Not at all.

Ph. No more do I.

G. I will go onward hence to the bawd's; there they are now.

An. Ho Geta.

G. Lo there is for you. Is it any wonder or strange thing for you
To be called back again, when you have begun the race?

An. Geta.

G.

An. Do you not tarry?

G. You shall be beaten: he is some little Beadle of the ward that calls me.

An. That shall be done to you by and by, except you stay, you whipped raskal.

G. This must be some body that is more acquainted with me; he threatens harm.
But is it he whom I am seeking or no? it is he.

Ph. Go talk with him presently.

An. What is the matter?

G.
For without controversy, you are the only happy man, Antipho.

An. I wish I were: but I would have it told me, why I should believe it is so.

G. Is it not enough, if I make you besmeared with joy?

An. You quite kill me.

P. But do you away with these promises, and tell me what you bring.

G. Oh,
Phormio?

Ph. I was here. But do you forbear?

G. Hearken, ha,
As soon as I had given you the money even now at the market: we went home.
Straightway. In the mean time my master sent me to your wife.

An. Wherefore?

G. I forbear to utter it, for it is nothing to this matter, Antipho.
When I began to go into the nurserie, the boy, Mida came running to me,

Why he held me: he says, that it was forbidden any body to go in to his
mistress.
Only Sophrona says he brought in Chremes hither the old-man's brother.
And he is now within with them; when I heard this, I went on to go to the door.
Upon my tip-toes softly; I came to it; I stood,

Catching at her speech on this fashion.

A. O brave Geta.

G. Here I heard
A most fine prank, so as truly I almost cried out for joy.

Ph. What was it?

G. What do you think?

A. I know not.

G. But it is a most wonderful thing.
Your uncle is found to be the father of your wife Phanium.

A. Ha,


G. He kept company with her mother long ago in Lemnus.

Ph. This is but a dream: is it likely that she should be ignorant of her own
father?

G. Pho^mio,
Believe there is some reason; but do you think that I could understand all
things
Without the door, which they did within amongst themselves?

Ph. And indeed I have also heard that tale.

G. Nay indeed I will tell you somewhat,

Not long after hewent in again with your father;
They both said they gave you leave to have her.
At the last, I am sent to seek you and bring you to them.

A. Ho, but then carry me; why do you leiter?

G. I will do it.

A. Pho^mio, fare you well.

Ph. Farewell Antipho.
I swear, it is well done, and I am glad
That they had so great fortune;
I have now an especial occasion to cozen the old-men,
And to take away from Phaedrsa his care concerning the money,

For as this money was given with an ill will,
It shall be bestowed on these: I have found out a way indeed, how I can
enforce this.
Now I must take a new gesture and countenance;
But I will step aside into this next by-corner:

Whither I pretended to go to the Mart. I do not go.

A. Quamobrem?

G. Omitto proloqui, nam nihil ad hanc rem est, Antipho.
Ubi in gyneceum ire occipio, puer ad me occurrit Mida,

Quamobrem detineret me: ait esse vetitum intro ad he am accedere.

Eumque nunc esse intus cum illis; hoc ubi ego audivi, ad fores
Suspenso gradu placide ire perrexi, accessi, steti:

Intelligere extra ostium, intus quae inter sese ipsi egerunt?

Ph. Atque hercle ego quoque illam audivi sabulam.

G. Immo etiam dabo,

Haud multo post cum patre idem se recipit intro denuo:
Ait uterque tibi potestatem ejus habendae se dare;
Denique ego missus sum, te ut requirerem atque adducerem.

A. Hem, quin ergo, rape me; quid cessas?

G. Fecero.

A. Phormio, vale.

Ph. Vale Antipho.
Been ita me Dii ament f^ctum, gaudeo
Tantam fortunam de improviso esse his datam.
Summa eludendi occasio est mihi nunc senes,
Et Phaedriae curam adimere argentariam,

Nam idem hoc argentum ita ut datum est ingratis, his
Datum erit; hoc qui cogam, re ipsa repperi.
Nunc gestus mihi, vultusque est capiundus novus:
Sed hinc concedam in angiportum hunc proxumum,

Quo me assimula^ram ire ad mercatum, non eo.

DEMIPHO. PHORMIO. CHREMES. D. I Have cause to give God great thanks, and I do
t^^nk him,
Seeing these things, brother, have fallen out well ^or us.
Now, Phormio is to be met with all as soon as may be,
Before he wastfully spend our thirt^e pounds,


Ph. I will go see,
If Demipho be at home, that what --

D. But we were going to you, Phormio.

Ph. About this same errand perhaps.

De. Yes indeed.

Ph. I thought so.
Why were you going to me? that is a jest; are you afraid
Lest I should not do that, which I had once undertaken?

I have hither to ^ad a care of this one thing indeed, that I should be trusted.

Chapter Is she, as I said, of a good disposition?

D. Very good.

Ph. Therefore I come to you to te^^ you, Demipho,
That I am ready, when you will; give me my wife.

After I had observed that you were so very willing to it.

D. But this man has diss^aded me, from giving her to you.
For what a rumor will it be, says he, among the people, if you do it?
Heretos^re when it might be honestly done, then she was not giv^^ him;

Which you your self ere^^ile blamed before my face.

Ph. You b^^ool me stately enough.

D. How?

Ph. Do you ask*
Because indeed I cannot marry that other.
For with what face shall I return to he^ again, whom I have slighted?

Chapter Antipho dot^ let her go from him
With ^n ill will, say*

D. And besides I perceive my so^
Is indeed ^nwilling to let the woman go from him;
But step over to the market, I pray you, and give order
That that money be paid me again by a bill, Phormio*

P.

D. What shall we do then?

P. If you will give me my wife,
Which you have betrothed, I will marry her; but if it be so that you would
Have her to tarry with you, let all the portion tarry here with me, Demipho.
For it is not reasonable that I should be deceived because of you,

To another, which gave me as big a portion.

D. Get you hence and be hanged with that greatness,
You runnagate; do you think I do not even now know you,
Or you doings withal?

P. I am provoked.

D. Would you marry this woman,


P. Do but try.

D. That my son
May dwell with her at your ^ouse, this was your plot.

P. I pray you, what do you say?

D. But do you give me my money.

P. Nay indeed, do you give me my wife.

D. Walk with me before a Justice.

P. Before a Justice? truly if you go on to be fur^her troublesome*

D.

P. What I? you think that I perhaps
Patro^ize only them that have no portions:
I use also to do it to them that have portions.

C. What is that to us?

P. Nothing.
Here I knew a woman, whose husband another --

C. Ha.

D. What is the matter?
Wife ^ad at Lemnus.

C. I am quite undone.

P. By whom he ^ad


C. I am buried.

P. I will now go tell her these things too.

C. I pray you,
Do not do it.

P. Oh! was you be?

D. How he plays upon us?

C. We dismiss you.

P. These are but tales.

C. What will you have?
We forgive you the money which you have.

P. I hear you.

With your ^ond childish saying?
I will not, I will: I will, I will not: give me it again, take it.
What was said is unsaid; what was before confirmed, is now made void.

C. How, or whence did he know these things?

D. I know not;


C. This is strange, I swear.

P. I have gravelled them.

D. Ha,
Is it fit that he should carry away this so much money from us
Jeering us thus openly! truly we had better dye.
Therefore prepare to be of a manly and ready courage.

And that-you cannot now conceal it from your wife.
Now, Chremes, what she is likely to bear from others,
It is more pacifying for us to tell it our selves;
Then we may be able to be revenged of this filthy fellow


P. Alas, unless I look to my self, I am at a stay.
These men endeavor to come toward me with a mind to kill or be killed.

C. But I am afraid she cannot be pacified.

D. Have a ^ood heart,
I will make you friends again; presuming upon this, Chremes,
Seeing she is dead, by whom you had this daughter.

P.
Truly, Demipho, you have provoked me not for his good.
Do you say at last, after you have done what you list in another country,
And have had no regard to this worthy gentlewoman,
But have offered her disgrace after a new fashion;

I will make her so incensed against you with these sayings,
That you shall not quench her, though you melt into tears.

D. A mischief which I wish might light upon him;
That any man should be so very a^dacious?

Into some solitary country?

C. I am now brought to that pass,
That I know not at all what I should do with him.

D. I kn^w,
Let us go before a Justice.

P. Before a Justice! hither, if you have any ^ist.

D. But follow him, and hold him, whilst I call out the servants hence.

C.

P. Here is one action Against you.

C. Prosecute it by law then.

P. I have another against you, Chremes.

D. Carry this fellow away.

Ph. Do you do so? truly I have need (...) my voice.
Nausistrata, come ^orth.

C. Stop his mouth.

D. Look you, this base knave
How much he is able to do.

P. Nausistrata, I say.

C. Do you not hold your peace?

P.

D. Except he follow, thump him on the belly with your fists,
Or put out his eye.

P. There is a place, where I will be revenged on you.

DEMIPHO. PHORMIO. CHREMES. D. DIis merito magnas gratias habeo, atque ago,
Quand^ evene^e hae^ nobis frater prospe^e.
Quantum potest nunc conveniendus Phormio est,
Priusquam dilapidet n^stras triginta minas,


P. Demiphonem si d^mi est,
Visam; ut quod --

D. At nos ad te ibamus, Phormi^.

P. De eadem hac fortasse causa.

D. Ita hercle.

P. Credidi.
Quid ad me ibatis? ridiculum; an veremini,
Ne non id facerem, quod recepissem se^l?

Adhuc curavi unum hoc quidem, ut mihi esse^ fides.

C. Estne ita, ut dixi, liberalis?

D. Oppido.

P. Itaque ad vos venio nunciatum, Demipho.
Paratum me esse, ubi vultis* uxorem date.

Po^tquam tantopere id vos velle animum advorteram.

D. At hic de^ortatus est me, ne illam tibi darem,
Nam qui erit rumor populi, inquit, si id feceris?
Olim cum honest potuit, tunc non est data:

Quae ^ute dudum coram me incusaveras.

P. Satis superbe illuditis me.

D. Qui?

P. Rogas*
Qui^ ne alteram quidem illam potero ducere.
Nam quo redibo o^e ad eam, quam co^^empserim?

C. Antipbonem video ab s^ amittere
Invitum eam, inque.

D. Tum autem video fi^^um
Invitum sane mulie^em ab se ^mittere.
Sed transi sodes ad forum, atque illud mihi
Argentum rursum jube resc^ibi, Phormi^.

P.

D. Quid igitur fiet?

P. Si vis mihi uxorem dare,
Quam despondisti, ducam; sin est, ut velis,
Manner illam apud te, dos hic omnis maneat, Demipho.
Nam non est aequum me propter vos decipi,

Remiserim, quae dotis tantundem dabat.

D. I in malam rem hi^c cum istac magnificentia*
Fugitive; etiam nunc credis te ignorarier,
Aut tua facta ade^?

P. Irritor.

D. Tu hanc duceres,


P. Fac periculum.

D. Ut filius Cum illa habitet apud te? hoc vestrum consilium fuit.

P. Quaeso quid narras?

D. Quin tu argentum cedo.

P. Immo ^e o tu uxorem cedo.

D. In jus ambula.

P. In jus? enimvero si porro esse odiosi pergitis.

D.

P. Egone? vos me indotatis modo
Patrocinari fortasse arbitramini*
Etiam dotatis soleo.

C. Quid id nostra?

P. Nihil.
H^c quandam noram, cujus vir uxorem --

C. Hem.

D. Quid est?
Lemni habuit aliam*

C. Nullus sum.

P. Ex qua filiam


C. Sepultus sum.

P. Haec adeo ego illi jam denarrabo.

C. Obsecro,
Ne facias.

P. Oh, tun* is eras?

D. Ut ludos ^acit?

C. Missum te facimus.

P. Fabulae.

C. Quid vis ^ibi?
Argentum quod habes, condonamus te.

P. Audio:

I^^pta vestra puerili sententia?
Nolo, volo: volo, nolo: ^ursum cedo, cape:
Quod dictum, indictum est; quod modo erat ratum, irritum est.

C. Quo pacto, aut unde haec hic rescivit?

D. Nescio,


C. Monstri, ita me Dii ament, simile.

P. Injeci scrupulum.

D. Hem.
Hiccine ut a nobis tantum hoc argenti auferat
Tam aperte irridens? emori hercle satius est.
Animo virili praesentique ut sis para.

Neque id jam celare posse te uxorem tuam;
Nunc quod ipsa ex aliis auditura sit, Chreme,
Id nosmetipsos indicare placabilius est,
Tum hunc impuratum poterimus nostro modo


P. Atat, nisi mihi prospicio, haereo.
Hi gladiatorio animo ad me affectant viam.

C. At vereor ut placa^i possit.

D. Bono animo es.
Ego redigam vos in gratiam; hoc sretus, Chreme,
Cum e medio excessit, unde haec suscepta est tibi.

P.
Non hercle ex re iftius me instigasti, Demipho.
Ain' tu tandem, ubi peregre tibi quod libitum fuit feceris,
Neque hujus sis veritus faeminae primariae,
Quin novo modo eifaceres contumelias;

His ego illam dictis ita tibi incensam dabo,
Ut ne restinguas, lachrymis si exstillaveris.

D. Malum, quod isti Dii Deaeque omnes duint,
Tantane affectum hominem quenquam esse audacia?

In solas terras?

C. In id redactus sum loci,
Ut quid agam ex illo nesciam prorsus.

D. Ego scio,
In jus eamus.

P. In jus? huc, si quid lubet.

D. At sequere, ac retine, dum ego hinc servos evoco.

C.

P. Una injuria est
Tecum.

C. Lege agito ergo.

P. Altera est tecum, Chreme.

D. Rap^ hunc.

P. Itane agitis (...) enimvero voce est opus.
Nausistrata, exi.

C. Os opprime.

D. Impurum vide,
Quantum valet.

P. Nausistrata, inquam.

C. Non taces?

Vel oculum exclude.

P. Est, ubi vos ulciscar, locus.

NAUSISTRATA. CHREMES. PHORMIO. DEMIPHO. N. WHo names me?

C. Ah.

N. What a stir is there, I pray you,
My husband?

P. How now, why have you now held your peace?

N. What fellow is this?
Do you not answer me?

P. Would you have him to answer you,
Who indeed knows not where he is?

D. Take heed how you believe this fellow in any thing.

P.

C. It is nothing.

N. What is it then that he says?

P. You shall know by and by:
Hark you.

C. Do you go on to believe him?

N. What, I pray you,
Should I believe him who has said nothing?

P. The poor man dotes For fear.

N. Truly it is not for nothing that you are so afraid.

C.

P. Very well indeed: if you be not afraid,
And this be nothing that I say, do you tell.

D. You rogue! Should he tell you?

P. O you Sir, you have taken very great pains
For you brother.

N. My husband, do not you tell me?

C. But.

N. What but?

C. It is not needful to tell it.

P. For you, but it is needful for her to know it.


C. Ah, what say you?

D. Do not you hold your peace?

P. Unknown to you.

C. Woe is me.

P. He married a wife.

N My husband, God sent better news.

P. It is done so.

N. I am undone poor woman.

P. And by her he has
One daughter already, whilst you was asleep.

C. What do we?

N. O strange, an unworthie and naughty prank.

D

N. Was any thing done to day more unworthilie?
Who when they come to have more wives, then become old men.
Demipho, I appeal to you, for it quite irks me to speak with this man himself.
Were these things your often journeyings, and long tarryings
At Lemnus? was this the cheapness, that lessened our rent?

D. Nausistrata, I do not deny but here is blame deserved in this matter:
But such as may be pardoned.

P. You talk to one that is dead.

D. For he neither did it through neglect, or dislike of you,
Being full of wine almost above fifteen years ago, he got
Her with child, of whom this daughter is born, and he never touched her
afterward.

Wherefore I entreat you, as your other doings are, that you would take it
moderately.

N. What I take it moderately? I desire poor woman to be shut of this business.
But what should I hope? should I think he will less offend further hereafter
through age?
He was then already an old man; if old age makes men bashful.
Demipho?
What do you now allege to me, why I should expect or hope that it be no more
so?

P. For them that have leisure to go to the burial of Chremes, hoe, it is time.
I will tell them thus? go to now, go to; let who will provoke Phormio;
I will make him be slain with such a misfortune, as this man is.

She has that, which she may ring in his ear to him, as long as he lives.

N. Do I think this was done through my desert? why should I now mention those
things, Demipho,
Severally, what a wife I have been toward him?

D. I know all things
As well as you.

N. This seems not to be done through my desert.

D. No in no wise.

Pardon him: he increateth; he confesses; he clears himself; what would you
have more?

Ph. But indeed before she give him his pardon, I will provide for my self, and
Phaedtia.
Ho Nausistrata, before you be too hasty to answer him, bear me.

N. What is the matter?

P. I have got thirty pounds from him by a trick*


Chapter Ha, what say you?

N. Do you think it such an unworthy thing, if your son
A young man have one sweet heart, when you have two wives?
Are you ashamed of nothing? with what face can you chide him? answer me.

D. You shall do as you will.

N. Nay that you may now know my mind,

Before I see my son; I leave all to his judgment.
What he shall command, I will do.

Ph. You are a wise woman, Nausistrata.

N. Is this sufficient for you?

Ph. Yea truly Ico me off gallantly and and finely, and beyond my hope.

N. Do you tell me your name, what it is.

Ph. Mine? Phormio,
Truly a friend to your family, and most to your Phaedria.

N. Phormio, truly but I will do and say for you hereafter any thing I shall be
able,
And what you shall desire.

Ph. You speak bountifully.

N. Indeed it is your desert.

Ph. Will you do one thing first to day, which I may be glad on, Nausistrata,
And which your husband may not abide to see?

N. I desire to do it.

Ph. Invite me to supper.

N.

D. Let us go in hence.

N. But where is Phaedria
Our Umpire?

Ph. I will cause that he shall be here by and by. Fare ye well, and clap your
hands.

Not unto us, O LORD.
