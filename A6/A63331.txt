A True ACCOUNT Of the late most doleful, and lamentable TRAGEDY OF OLD Maddam
Gwinn, MOTHER To Maddam ELENOR GWINN; WHO Was unfortunately drowned, in a
Fish Pond, at her own Mansion House, NEAR THE NEAT-HOUSES.
WITH An Account how that much to be deplored Accident, came to pass; and what
is expected will be the sequel of the same. With an Epitaph, composed against
the Solemnity of her Pompous Funeral; and many other Circumstances.
WOnderful strange are the Fates of some, who without the Prediction of Stars,
make their Perigrination into a a Subterranean Palace; thinking positively to
enter without the Art of Conjuration, and that the Grimjaw'd Regent will at all
times break his Rest for their Reception; but if they do more seriously
consider, and weigh the Order of that place, they will find a thousand dire
Obstructions interpose; for since the grand imposture was in Hurricanes there
sent, he and his barbarous Crew have dately moddel'd ancient Custom^^ and
turned topsi turvy all the pleasing Dictate; Fren'en Councils had imposed, that
none should come without a lawful was nin^^ that place, least Insurrection be
incessant made, and all bernined, by some Close Intreague; but women sure, are
not such dangerous things, their Tongues the only Weapons are, and they enough
to make grand Pluto start, not being used to peals of Thunder, nor shrill
Echoed sounds; but since now we are discoursing concerning silent departures,
and of noiseless Fates, a strange surprisal whispers in our Ears, and tells us,
that a chief Matron's gone, being sent on a Pilgrimage to confess her
Exorbitancies at the Shrine of Neptune, for the abuses she has lately done to
his Element, and the Subjeands of his watery Territories. For this studious
Matron by great pains and industry, and at her vast expense, partly in the
discovery of the Philosophers stone, and partly to find out an ingenious method
to restore lost Maiden-heads, that so she might to her abundant profit make a
double Morgage to such Buffoon beauty-hunters who daily accosted her for the
procuration of some Rose-buds tho June be past, as likewise to sinde but a
private Tincture for to sprucifie her Daughters decayed Phisiogmony; amongst
the many she invented, at last she found out an experienced way to catch those
sporting Animals, that frisk in watery plains (otherwise this) but by reason of
her great Charge, in acquiring such a peremptory secret, it is no reason but the
Reader should contribute for his knowledge toward the Magnificent pomp of her
intended Funeral) the which is shortly to be solemnized, by the Order of her
virtuous Daughter, a Lady of great Fame and greater Repute; she among her
private Chimical Operations finding Brandy to be of a powerful and prevailing
Influence, that by the only help of that immortal Liquor she had attained to
most of her Experiments and that with a sufficient Dose, she could at her
Pleasure as she thought most fitting and convenient, either quicken or stupify
the Senses, or locomotive faculties of Life and Reason, often pondering in her
Voluminous Cogitations Its Conquering Prevalency: at last she resolving for her
better Diversion, to impose upon Tritonian Neptunes Subjects, the unthinking
Gudgeons, that Sin she her self had been so often Guilty of; and as the Devil
tempted Eve in her Primitive Innocence, by the alluring Inticements of a
various colored Pippin, so she to imitate his Craft, getting a new halfpenny
Loaf, and taking in her hand a quart of her stupifying Elixar Vitae, some of
the which she drawing into her Mouth by virtue of a Quill, spurred it into the
divided Loaf, and so with the moisture, making it up into little Balls or
Pellets, the which, she cast into the Element or Fishpond, the which no sooner
being in (such a stupendous proficiency attended her Invention) but Sholes of
harmless Gudgeons not knowing their powerful Operations) came nibling about
them, which so tickled her Fancy to behold, that she was resolved not to be
behind hand with them; but kept time with her Bottel, and so often did the good
old Gentlewoman participate of the comfortable Creature, that she exhausted the
quintessence of the Vas Vitrum, whereupon her imagination being Elevated, she
like Copernicus conceived a sond Opinion that the World was made of a
Windmil-Sail, and that it danced the Hay, and tripped about the dazzling
Luminaries of the Azure Skies, and this Opinion did so far prevail upon her
Airy Pericranium, that seeing the Intrels of her Bottle were excruciated, and
that the Monsieure was departed, leaving only a bare scent behind him, that it
might be known he had been lately there, she was transported so beyond her self
for want of new supplies, and thinking now the Fishpond had been turned into
the same, and by device of Transubstantiation, it lost its Elementary
Constitution, whereupon she never stood to pause, but Glacus like her Feet were
turned into Wings, and then she cried I come, nor will I want whilst so much
stands in view, and making some Indentures, as the Emblems of a Will, (not
needing then a Scrivener for that purpose, straight she flounder'd in; the Fish
affrighted, fly and hide themselves within the Ripid Banks, leaving for
Manners-sake their Breakfast half behind. But many of them having participated
of the Good Matrons bounty were enforced to stay behind, not knowing what a
Habias Corpus meant, their Benifactor being in, now found her grand mistak;
then long in vain did she implore their Aid, but they like her, were far too
feeble or insensible to yield the least Relief; and sure had Trident-bearing
Neptune been there himself, so Corpulent a Mass of Flesh, would have outvied
his strength to have delivered her safe on Shore; but oh, the cruel Fate of
some senister Star that ruled her Birth, she there expired, and left the Fish
to be the Executors of her Will to this sad and dismal Tragedy, the which has
caused a universal Grief among the bucksom Bana-Robas, So that is generally
believed, that upon so Tragical occasion, the Palace and the Fish Pond will be
forfeited to her most virtuous Daughter, Maddam Ellen Gwin, as Lady of the
Soil, and chief of all the Bona-Robas that the Suburbian Schools of Venus late
have fitted for the Game. And now in Gratitude to this good Matrons Memory, to
be imposed upon her Tombstone at the approaching Solemnization we have
composed this Epitaph as follows,

EPITAPH.
HEre lies the Victim of a cruel Fate,
Whom too much Element did Ruinate;
It Is something strange, but yet most wondrous true,
That what we live by, should our Lives undo.
She that so often had powerful Waters tried,
At last with silence, in a Fish Pond died.
Fate was unjust, for had he prv'd but kind;
To make it Brandy, he had pleased her Mind.
FINIS.
