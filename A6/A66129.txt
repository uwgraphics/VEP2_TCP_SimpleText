PROT. RELIGION AND LIBERTY



Printed at the Hague by ARNOLD LEERS, Bookseller at the Sign of Plutarch. By
special order of his Highness, 1688.

With Privilege of the Great and Mighty the States of Holland and
Westfriesland.

THE DECLARATION OF HIS HIGHNESS WILLIAM HENRY, By the Grace of God PRINCE OF
ORANGE, etc. Of the reasons inducing him, To Appear in Arms in the Kingdom of
England.
IT is both certain and evident to all men, that the public Peace and Happiness
of any State or Kingdom, can not be preserved, where the Laws, Liberties and
Customs established by the lawful authority in it, are openly transgressed
and annulled: more especially where the alteration of Religion is endeavored,
and that a Religion which is contrary to Law is endeavored to be introduced:
upon which those who are most immediately concerned in it, are indispensably
bound to endeavor to preserve and maintain the established Laws, Liberties
and Customs: and above all the Religion and worship of God, that is
established among them; and to take such an effectual care, that the
Inhabitants of the said State or Kingdom, may neither be deprived of their
Religion nor of their Civil Rights. Which is so much the more necessary
because the Greatness and Security both of Kings Royal families, and of all
such as are in Authority, as well as the happiness of their Subjects and People,
depend in a most especial manner upon the exact observation and maintenance of
these their Laws, Liberties and Customs.

Upon these grounds it is, that We cannot any longer forbear to Declare that
to our great regret We see that those Councillors, who have now the chief
credit with the King, have overturned the Religion, Laws and Liberties of
those Realms, and subjected them in all things relating to their Consciences,
Liberties and Properties, to Arbitrary Government: and that not only by secret
and indirect ways, but in an open and undisguised manner.

Those Evil Councillors for the advancing and coloring this with some
plausible pretexts, did invent and set on foot the Kings Dispencing power, by
virtue of which, they pretend that according to Law, he can Suspend and
Dispense with the Execution of the Laws, that have been enacted by the
Authority, of the King and Parliament, for the security and happiness of the
Subject, and so have rendered those Laws of no effect: Tho there is nothing
more certain, then that as no Laws can be made, but by the joint concurrence
of King and Parliament, so likewise laws so enacted, which secure-the Public
peace, and safety of the Nation, and the lives and liberties of every subject
in it, can not be repealed or suspended but by the same authority.

For tho the King may pardon the punishment, that a Transgressour has incurred,
and to which he is condemned, as in the cases of Treason or Felony; yet it can
not be with any color of reason inferred from thence, that the King can
entirely suspend the execution of those Laws, relating to Treason or Felony:
unless it is pretended, that he is clothed with a Despotick and Arbitrary
power, and that the Lives, Liberties, Honors and Estates of the Subjects,
depend wholly on his good will and pleasure, and are entirely subject to him;
which must infallibly follow on the Kings having a power to suspend the
execution of the Laws, and to dispense with them.

Those Evil Councillors, in order to the giving some credit to this strange
and execrable Maxim, have so conducted the matter, that they have obtained a
Sentence from the Judges, declaring that this Dispencing power is a Right
belonging to the Crown; as if it were in the power of the twelve Judges to
offer up the Laws, Rights and Liberties, of the whole Nation, to the King, to
be disposed of by him Arbitrarily and at his Pleasure and expressly contrary to
Laws enacted for the security of the Subjects. In order to the obtaining this
Judgment, those Evil Councillors did before hand examine secretly the Opinion
of the Judges, and procured such of them, as could not in Conscience concur
in so pernicious a Sentence, to be turned out, and others to be substituted in
their rooms till by the changes which were made, in the Courts of Judicature,
they at last obtained that Judgment. And they have raised some to those Trusts,
who make open profession of the Popish Religion, tho those are by Law rendered
incapable all such Employments.

It is also manifest and notorious, that as his Majesty was, upon his coming
to the Crown, received and acknowledged by all the subjects of England,
Scotland and Ireland, as their King without the least opposition, tho he made
then open profession of the Popish Religion so he did then promise, and
solemnly swear at his Coronation, that he would maintain his subjects, in the
free enjoyment of their Laws, Rights and Liberties, and in particular, that he
would maintain the Church of England as it was established by Law: It is
likewise certain, that there have been at diverse and sundry times, several
Laws enacted for the preservation of those Rights and Liberties, and of the
Protestant Religion: and among other Securities, it has been enacted that all
Persons whatsoever, that are advanced to any Ecclesiastical Dignity, or to
bear Office in either University, as likewise all other that should be put in
any Employment, Civil or Military, should declare that they were not Papists,
but were of the Protestant Religion, and that by their taking of the Oaths of
Allegange and Supreamacy and the Test, yet these Evil Councillors have in
effect annulled and abolished all those Laws, both with relation to
Ecclesiastical and Civil Employments.

In order to Ecclesiastical Dignities and Offices they have not only without
any color of Law, but against most express Laws to the contrary, set up a
Commission of a certain number of persons, to whom they have committed the
cognizance and direction of all Ecclesiastical matters: in the which
Commission there has been and still is, one of His Majesty's Ministers of
State, who makes now public profession of the Popish Religion, and who at the
time of his first professing it, declared that for a great while before, he had
believed that to be the only true Religion. By all this, the deplorable State
to which the Protestant Religion is reduced is apparent, since the Affairs of
the Church of England, are now put into the hands of Persons, who have accepted
of a Commission that is manifesty Illegal; and who have executed it contrary to
all Law; and that now one of their chief Members has abjured the Protestant
Religion and declared himself a Papist; by which he is become Incapable of
holding any Public Employment: The said Commissioners have hitherto given such
proof, of their submission to the directions given them, that there is no
reason to doubt, but they will still continue to promote all such designs as
will be most aggreable to them. And those Evil Councillors take care ta raise
none to any Ecclesiastical dignities, but persons that have no zeal for the
Protestant Religion, and that now hide their un concernednes for it, under the
specious pretense of Moderation. The said Commissioners have suspended the
Bishop of London, only because he refused to obey an order, that was sent him
to suspend a Worthy Divine, without so much as citing him before him, to make
his own Defense, or observing the common forms of process. They have turned
out a President, chosen by the fellows of Magdalen College, and afterward all
the Fellows of that College, without so much as citing them before any Court
that could take legal cognissance of that affair; or obtaining any Sentence
against them by a Competent Judge. And the only reason that was given for
turning them out, was their refusing to choose for their President; a Person
that was recommended to them, by the Instigation of those Evil Councillors;
tho the right of a free Election belonged undoubtedly to them. But they were
turned out of their freeholds, contrary to Law, and to that express provision
in the Magna Chartae; that no man shall loose life or goods, but by the Law of
the land. And now these Evil Councillors have put the said College wholly
into the hands of Popists, tho as is abovesaid, they are incapable of all such
Employments, both by the Law of the Land, and the statutes of the College.
These Commissioners have also cited before them all the Chancellours and
Archdeacons of England, requiring them to certify to them the names of all
such Clergymen, as have read the Kings declaration for Liberty of Conscience,
and of such as have not read it: without considering that the reading of it was
not enjoined the Clergy, by the Bishops, who are their Ordinaries. The
Illegality and Incompetency of the said Court of the Ecclesiastical
Commissioners was so notoriously known, and it did so evidently appear that it
tended to the subversion of the Protestant Religion, that the Most Reverend
Father in God, William Archbishop of Canterbury Primate and Metropolitan of all
England, seeing that it was raised for no other end but to oppress such
persons as were of eminent virtue, learning and piety, refused to sit or to
concur in it.

And tho there are many express Laws against all Churches or Chappells, for
the exercise of the Popish Religion, and also against all Monasteries and
Convents, and more particularly against the order of the Jesuits, yet those
Evil Councillors have procured orders for the building of several Churches
and Chapels, for the exercise of that Religion: They have also procured
diverse Monasteries to be erected, and in contempt of the Law they have not
only set up several Colleges of Jesuits, in diverse places, for the
corrupting of the youth, but have raised up one of the Order, to be a Privy
Counselor and a Minister of State. By all which they do evidently show, that
they are restrained by no rules or Law whatsoever; but that they have subjected
the Honors and Estates of the subjects, and the established Religion to a
Despotick power and to Arbitrary Government: In all which they are served and
seconded by those Ecclesiastical Commissioners.

They have also followed the same methods with Relation to Civil affairs: For
they have procured orders to examine all Lords Lieutenants, Deputy Lieutenants,
Sheriffs, Justices of Peace and all others that were in any Public Employment,
if they would concur with The King in the repeal of the Test and Penal Laws:
and all such, whose consciences did not suffer them to comply with their
designs, were turned out; and others were put in their places, who they
believed would be more compliant to them in their designs of defeating the
intent and Execution of those Laws, which had been made with so much care and
caution for the security of the Protestant Religion. And in many of these
places they have put professed Papists, tho the Law has disabled them, and
warranted the subjects not to have any regard to their Orders.

They have also invaded the Privileges, and seized on the Charters of most of
those Towns that have a right to be represented by their Burgesses in
Parliament: and have procured surrenders to be made of them, by which the
Magistrates in them have delivered up all their Rights and Priveledges, to be
disposed of at the pleasure of those Evil Councillors: who have thereupon,
placed new Magistrates in those Towns, such as they can most entirely confide
in: and in many of them they have put Popish Magistrates, notwithstanding the
Incapacities under which the Law has put them.

And whereas no Nation whatsoever can subsist without the administration of
good and impartial Justice, upon which men's Lives, Liberties, Honors and
Estates, do depend; those Evil Councillors have subjected these to an
Arbitrary and Despotick power: In the most important affairs they have studied
to discover before hand, the Opinions of the Judges; and have turned out such,
as they found would not conform themselves to their intentions: and have put
others in their places, of whom they were more assured, without having any
regard to their abilities. And they have not stuck to raise even professed
Papists to the Courts of Judicature, notwithstanding their Incapacity by Law,
and that no regard is due to any Sentences flowing from them. They have carried
this so far, as to deprive such Judges, who in the common administration of
Justice, showed that they were governed by their Consciences, and not by the
directions which the others gave them. By which it is apparent that they
design to render themselves the absolute Masters of the Lives, Honors and
Estates of the subjects, of what rank or dignity soever they may be: and that
without having any regard either to the equity of the cause, or to the
consciences of the Judges, whom they will have to submit in all things to their
own will and pleasure: hoping by such ways to intimidate those who are yet in
Employment, as also such others, as they shall think fit, to put in the Rooms
of those whom they have turned out; and to make them see, what they must look
for, if they should at any time act in the least contrary to their good liking,
and that no failings of that kind are pardoned in any persons whatsoever. A
great deal of blood has been shed in many places of the Kingdom, by Judges
governed by those Evil Councillors, against all the rules and forms of Law;
without so much as suffering the persons that were accused to plead in their
own Defense.

They have also by putting the administration of justice in the hands of
Papists, brought all the matters of Civil Justice into great uncertainties:
with how much exactnes and Justice soever that these Sentences may have been
given. For since the Laws of the Land do not only exclude Papists from all
places of Judicature, but have put them under an Incapacity, none are bound to
acknowledge or to obey their Judgments, and all Sentences given by them, are
null and void of themselves: so that all persons who have been cast in trialls
before such Popish Judges, may justly look on their pretended Sentences, as
having no more force then the Sentences of any private and unauthorised person
whatsoever. So deplorable is the case of the Subjects, who are obliged to
answer to such Judges, that must in all things stick to the rules which are set
them by those Evil Councillors, who as they raised them up to those
Employments, so can turn them out of them at pleasure; and who can never be
esteemed Lawful Judges; so that all their Sentences are in the Construction of
the Law, of no force and efficacy. They have likewise disposed of all Military
Employments, in the same manner: For tho the Laws have not only excluded
Papists from all such Employments, but have in particular provided that they
should be disarmed; yet they in contempt of these Laws, have not only armed
the Papists, but have likewise raised them up to the greatest Military Trusts
both by Sea and Land, and that Strangers as well as Natives, and Irish as well
as English, that so by those means having rendered themselves Masters both of
the affairs of the Church, of the Government of the Nation, and of the course
of Justice, and subjected them all to a Despotick and Arbitrary power, they
might be in a capacity to maintain and execute their wicked designs by the
assistance of the Army, and thereby to enslave the Nation.

The dismal effects of this subversion of the established Religion, Laws and
Liberties in England appear more evidently to us, by what we see done in
Ireland, Where the whole Government is put in the hands of Papists, and where
all the Protestant Inhabitants are under the daily fears of what may be justly
apprehended from the Arbitrary power which is set up there: which has made
great numbers of them, leave that Kingdom and abandon their Estates in it,
remembering well that cruel and bloody Massacre which fell out in that Island
in the year 1641.

Those Evil Councillors have also prevailed with the King to declare in
Scotland that he is clothed with Absolute power, and that all the subjects are
bound to obey him without Reserve: upon which he has assumed an arbitrary
power, both over the Religion and Laws of that Kingdom, from all which it is
apparent, what is to be looked for in England, as soon as matters are duly
prepared for it.

Those great and insufferable Oppressions, and the open Contempt of all Law,
together with the apprehensions of the sad consequences that must certainly
follow upon it, have put the subjects under great and just fears; and have made
them look after such lawful remedies as are allowed of in all Nations: yet all
has been without effect. And those Evil Councillors have endeavored to make
all men apprehend the loss of their Lives, Liberties, Honors and Estates, if
they should go about to preserve themselves from this Oppression, by
Petitions, Representations, or other means authorized by Law. Thus did they
proceed with the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the other Bishops, who having
offered a most humble petition to the King, in terms full of Respect, and not
exceeding the number limited by Law, in which they set forth in short the
Reasons for which they could not obey that order, which by the Instigation of
those Evil Councillors, was sent them, requiring them to appoint their Clergy
to read in their Churches the Declaration for Liberty of Conscience; were sent
to prison and afterward brought to a Trial, as if they had been guilty of
some enormous Crime. They were not only obliged to defend themselves in that
pursuit, but to appear before professed Papists, who had not taken the Test and
by consequence were men whose interest led them to condemn them; and the
Judges that gave their opinion in their favors were thereupon turned out.

And yet it can not be pretended that any Kings; how great soever their power
has been, and how Arbitrary and Despotick soever they have been in the exercise
of it, have ever reckoned it a crime for their Subjects to come in all
submission and respect, and in a due number, not exceeding the limits of the
Law, and represent to them the reasons that made it impossible for them to obey
their orders. Those Evil Councillors have also treated a Peer of the Realm,
as a criminal, only because he said that the subjects were not bound to obey
the orders of a Popish Justice of Peace: tho it is evident, that they being by
Law rendered incapable of all such trusts, no regard is due to their orders.
This being the security which the people have by the Law for their Lives,
Liberties, Honors and Estates, that they are not to be subjected to the
Arbitrary procedings of Papists, that are contrary to Law put into any
Employments Civil or Military.

Both We our selves, and our Dearest and most Entirely Beloved Consort, the
Princess, have endeavored to signify in terms full of respect to the King
the just and deep Regret which all these Proceedings have given us; and in
Compliance with his Majesty's desires signified to us, We declared both by
word of mouth, to his Envoy, and in writing what our Thoughts were touching the
Repealing of the Test and Penal Laws; which we did in such a manner, that
We hoped We had proposed an Expedient, by which the Peace of those Kingdoms,
and a happy aggreement among the Subjects of all Persuasions, might have been
settled: but those Evil Councillors have put such ill Constructions on these
our good Intentions, that they have endeavored to alienate the King more and
more from us: as if We had designed to disturb the quiet and happiness of the
Kingdom.

The last and great Remedy for all those Evils, is the Calling of a
Parliament, for securing the Nation against the evil practices of those wicked
Councillors: but this could not be yet compassed, nor can it be easily brought
about. For those men apprehending that a lawful Parliament being once
assembled, they would be brought to an account for all their open violations of
Law, and for their Plots and Conspiracies against the Protestant Religion, and
the Lives and Liberties of the Subjects; they have endeavored under the
specious Pretense of Liberty of Conscience, first to sow divisions among
Protestants, between those of the Church of England and the Dissenters: The
design being laid to engage Protestants, that are all equally concerned to
preserve themselves from Popish Oppression; into mutual quarrellings; that so
by these, some advantages might be given to them to bring about their Designs;
and that both in the Election of the Members of Parliament, and afterward in
the Parliament it self. For they see well that if all Protestants, could enter
into a mutual Good Understanding one with another, and concur together, in
the Preserving of their Religion, it would not be possible for them to compass
their wicked ends. They have also required all Persons in the several Counties
of England, that either were in any Employment, or were in any considerable
Esteem, to declare before hand that they would concur in the Repeal of the
Test and Penal Laws; and that they would give their voices in the Elections
to Parliament, only for such as would concur in it. Such as would not thus
preingage themselves were turned out of all Employments; and others who entered
into those engagements were put in their places, many of them being Papists:
And contrary to the Charters and Privileges of those Buroughs, that have a
right to send Burgesses to Parliament, they have ordered such Regulations to be
made, as they thought fit and necessary for assuring themselves of all the
Members, that are to be chosen by those Corporations: and by this means they
hope to avoid that Punishment which they have deserved; tho it is apparent that
all Acts made by Popish Magistrates are null and void of themselves. So that no
Parliament can be Lawful, for which the Elections and Returns are made by
Popish Sheriffs and Majors of Towns; and therefore as long as the Authority and
Magistracy is in such hands, it is not possible to have any Lawful Parliament.
And tho according to the Constitution of the English Government and Immemoriall
Custom, all Elections of Parliament men ought to be made with an entire
Liberty, without any sort of force, or the requiring the Electors to choose
such Persons as shall be named to them, and the Persons thus freely elected
ought to give their Opinions freely upon all Matters, that are brought before
them, having the good of the Nation ever before their eyes, and following in
all things the dictates of their Conscience, yet now the People of England can
not expect a remedy from a free Parliament, Legally called and chosen, but they
may perhaps see one called, in which all Elections will be carried by Fraud or
Force, and which will be composed of such Persons, of whom those Evil
Councillors hold themselves well assured, in which all things will be carried
on according to their Direction and Interest, without any regard to the Good or
Happiness of the Nation. Which may appear evidently from this, that the same
Persons tried the Members of the last Parliament, to gain them to consent to
the Repeal of the Test and Penal Laws, and procured that Parliament to be
dissolved, when they found that they could not, neither by promises nor
threatenings, prevail with the Members to Comply with their wicked Designs.

But to crown all, there are great and violent Presumptions, inducing us to
believe, that those Evil Councillors, in order to the carrying on of their
ill designs, and to the gaining to themselves the more time for the Effecting
of them, for the encouraging of their Accomplices, and for the discouraging of
all Good Subjects, have published that the Queen has brought forth a Son: tho
there have appeared both during the Queens pretended Bigness, and in the manner
in which the Birth was managed, so many just and visible grounds of suspicion,
that not only We our selves, but all the good Subjects of those Kingdoms do
vehemently suspect, that the pretended Prince of Wales was not born by the
Queen. And it is notoriously known to all the world, that many both doubted of
the Queens Bigness, and of the Birth of the Child, and yet there was not any one
thing done to satisfy them, or to put an end to their Doubts.

And since our Dearest and most Entirely Beloved Consort, the Princess, and
likewise We our selves, have so great an Interest in this Matter, and such a
Right, as all the world knows, to the Succession to the Crown, since also the
English did in the year 1672. when the States General of the United Provinces
were Invaded in a most injust war, use their uttermost Endeavors to put an
end to that War, and that in opposition to those who were then in the
Government: and by their so doing, they run the hasard of losing both the
favor of the Court, and their Employments; And since the English Nation has
ever testified a most particular Affection and Esteem, both to pur Dearest
Consort the Princess, and to Our selves, WE cannot excuse our selves from
espousing their Interests in a matter of such high Consequence, and from
contributing all that lies in us for the maintaining both of the Protestant
Religion, and of the Laws and Liberties of those Kingdoms, and for the
Securing to them the continual Enjoyment of all their just Rights. To the doing
of which We are most earnestly solicited by a great many Lords, both
Spiritual and Temporal, and by many Gentlemen and other subjects of all Ranks.

THEREFORE it is that We have thought fit, to go over to England, and to
carry over with us a force sufficient by the blessing of God, to defend us from
the violence of those Evil Councillors. AND WE being desirous that our
Intentions in this may be rightly understood, have for this end prepared this
Declaration, in which as we have hitherto given a true Account of the Reasons
inducing us to it, So We now think fit to DECLARE that this our Expedition is
intended for no other Design, but to have a free and lawful Parliament
assembled as soon as is possible: and that in order to this, all the late
Charters by which the Elections of Burgesses are limited contrary to the
ancient custom, shall be considered as null and of no force: and likewise all
Magistrates who have been Injustly turned out, shall forthwith resume their
former Employments, as well as all the Borroughs of England shall return again
to their ancient Prescriptions and Charters: and more particularly that the
ancient Charter of the Great and famous City of London, shall again be in
Force; and that the Writts for the Members of Parliament shall be addressed to
the Proper Officers, according to Law and Custom. That also none be suffered
to choose or to be chosen Members of Parliament but such as are qualified by
Law: And that the Members of Parliament being thus lawfully chosen they shall
meet and sit in Full Freedom; That so the Two Houses may concur in the
preparing of such Laws, as they upon full and free debate, shall Judge
necessary and convenient, both for the confirming and executing the Law
concerning the Test and such other Laws as are necessary for the security and
Maintenance of the Protestant Religion; as likewise for making such Laws as
may establish a good aggreement between the Church of England and all
Protestant Dissenters, as also for the covering and securing of all such, who
will live peaceably under the Government as becomes good Subjects, from all
Persecution upon the account of their Religion, even Papists themselves not
excepted; and for the doing of all other things, which the Two Houses of
Parliament shall find necessary for the Peace, Honor and Safety of the Nation,
so that there may be no more danger of the Nations falling at any time
hereafter, under Arbitrary Government. To this Parliament we will also refer
the Enquiry into the birth of the pretended Prince of Wales, and of all things
relating to it and to the Right of Succession.

And We for our part will concur in every thing, that may procure the Peace
and Happiness of the Nation, which a Free and Lawful Parliament shall
determine; since we have nothing before our eyes in this our undertaking, but
the Preservation of the Protestant Religion, the Covering of all men from
Persecution for their Consciences, and the securing to the whole Nation the
free enjoyment of all their Laws, Rights and Liberties, under a Just and
Legal Government.

This is the design that we have proposed to our selves, in appearing upon
this occasion in Arms: in the Conduct of which, We will keep the Forces under
our Command, under all the Strictnes of Martial Discipline: and take a
special Care, that the People of the Countries through which We must march,
shall not suffer by their means: and as soon as the state of the Nation will
admit of it, We promise that We will send back all those Foreign Forces,
that We have brought along with us.

We do therefore hope that all People will judge rightly of us, and approve
of these our Proceedings: But We chiefly rely on the blessing of God for the
success of this our undertaking, in which We place our whole and only
Confidence.

We do in the last place invite and require all Persons whatsoever, All the
Peers of the Realm, both Spiritual and Temporal, all Lords Lieutenants,
Deputy Lieutenants, and all Gentleman, Citisens and other Commons of all ranks,
to come and assist us, in order to the Executing of this our Design; against
all such as shall Endeavor to Oppose us: that so We may prevent all those
Miseries, which must needs follow upon the Nations being kept under Arbitrary
Government and Slavery: and that all the Violences and disorders, which have
overturned the whole Constitution of the English Government, may be fully
redressed in a FREE AND LEGAL PARLIAMENT.

And We do likewise resolve that as soon as the Nations are brought to a
state of Quier, We will take care that a Parliament shall be called in
Scotland, for the restoring the Ancient Constitution of that Kingdom, and for
bringing the Matters of Religion to such a Setlement, that the people may live
easy and happy, and for putting an end to all the Injust Violences that have
been in a course of so many years Committed there.

We will also study to bring the Kingdom of Ireland to such a state, that the
Setlement there may be Religiously observed: and that the Protestant and
British Interest there may be secured. And We will endeavor by all possible
means, to procure such an establishment in all the three Kingdoms, that they
may all live in a happy Union and Correspondence together; and that the
Protestant Religion, and the Peace, Honor and Happiness of those Nations may be
established upon Lasting Foundations.

October in the year 1688. WILLIAM HENRY, PRINCE OF ORANGE.
By his Highnesses special command C: HUYGENS.

His Highnesses Additionall Declaration.
AFter we had prepared and printed this our Declaration, we have understood,
that the subverters of the Religion and Laws of those Kingdoms, hearing of
our Preparations, to assist the People against them, have begun to retract some
of the Arbitrary and Despotick powers, that they had assumed, and to vacate
some of their Jnjust Judgments and Decrees. The sense of their Guilt, and the
distrust of their force, have induced them to offer the City of London some
seeming relief from their Great Oppressions: hoping thereby to quiet the
People, and to divert them from demanding a Secure Reestablishment of their
Religion and Laws under the shelter of our Arms: They do also give out that
we Intend to Conquer and Enslave the Nation, And therefore it is that we have
thought fit to add a few words to our Declaration.

We are Confident, that no persons can have such hard thought of us, as to
Imagine that we have any other Design in this Undertaking, then to procure a
setlement of the Religion and of the Liberties and Properties of the subjects
upon so sure a foundation, that there may be no danger of the Nations relapsing
into the like miseries at any time hereafter. And as the forces that we have
brought along with us, are utterly disproportioned to that wicked design of
Conquering the Nation, if we were Capable of Intending it, so the Great
Numbers of the Principal Nobility and Gentry, that are men of Eminent Quality
and Estates, and persons of known Integrity and Zeal both for the Religion and
Government of England, many of them being also distinguished by their Constant
fidelity to the Crown, who do both accompany us in this Expedition, and have
earnestly solicited us to it, will cover us from all such Malicious
Insinuations: For it is not to be imagined, that either those who have Invited
us, or those that are already come to assist us, can join in a wicked attempt
of Conquest, to make void their own lawful Titles to their Honors, Estates
and Interests: We are also Confident that all men see how little weight there
is to be laid, on all Promises and Engagments that can be now made: since there
has been so little regard had in time past, to the most solemn Pormises. And as
that Imperfeit redress that is now offered, is a plain Confession of those
Violations of the Government that we have set forth, So the Defectivenes of it
is no less Apparent: for they lay down nothing which they may not take up at
Pleasure: and they reserve entire and not so much as mentioned, their claims
and pretenses to an Arbitrary and Despotick power; which has been the root of
all their Oppression, and of the total subversion of the Government. And it is
plain, that there can be no redress nor Remedy offered but in Parliament: by a
Declaration of the Rights of the Subjects that have been invaded: and not by
any Pretended Acts of Grace, to which the extremity of their affairs has driven
them. Therefore it is that we have thought fit to declare, that we will
refer all to a Free Assembly of the Nation, in a Lawful Parliament.

Given under our Hand and Seal, at our Court in the Hague, the 24. day of
October in the year of our Lord 1688. WILLIAM HENRY, PRINCE OF ORANGE.
By his Highnesses special Command C: HUYGENS.

THE DECLARATION OF HIS HIGHNESS WILLIAM HENRY, By the Grace of God PRINCE OF
ORANGE, etc. Of the reasons inducing him, To Appear in Arms for Preserving of
the Protestant Religion, and for Restoring the Laws and Liberties of the
ancient Kingdom of Scotland.
IT is both certain and evident to all men, that the public Peace and Happiness
of any State or Kingdom, can not be preserved, where the Laws, Liberties and
Customs established by the lawful authority in it, are openly transgressed
and annulled: more especially where the alteration of Religion is endeavored,
and that a Religion which is contrary to Law is endeavored to be introduced:
upon which those who are most immediately concerned in it, are indispensably
bound to endeavor to preserve and maintain the established Laws, Liberties
and Customs: and above all the Religion and worship of God, that is
established among them; and to take such an effectual care, that the
Inhabitants of the said State or Kingdom, may neither be deprived of their
Religion nor of their Civil Rights. Which is so much the more necessary
because the Greatness and Security both of Kings Royal families, and of all
such as are in Authority, as well as the happiness of their Subjects and People,
depend in a most especial manner upon the exact observation and maintenance of
these their Laws, Liberties and Customs.

Upon these grounds it is, that We cannot any longer forbear to Declare that
to our great regret We see that those Councillors, who have now the chief
credit with the King, have overturned the Religion, Laws and Liberties of
those Realms, and subjected them in all things relating to their Consciences,
Liberties and Properties, to Arbitrary Government: and that not only by secret
and indirect ways, but in an open and undisguised manner.

And indeed the lamentable effects of an Arbitrary Power and of Evil Counsels
are so Manifest in the deplorable State of the Kingdom of Scotland, that both
our reason and conscience do prompt us to an abhorrence of them. For when we
consider the sad condition that Nation, though always affectionate to the
Royal Family, and governed for many Ages by Laws made by the authority of
their Kings, and of the Estates of Parliament, and by Common customs, is
reduced to, by endeavors that have been used to change the constitution of the
Monarchy regulate by Laws, into a Despotick or Arbitrary Power: which does
evidently appear not only by the actings of Evil Councillors in power, but by
the deliberate and express public Declarations, bearing that the King is an
Absolute Monarch, to whom obedience ought to be given in all things without
reserve, thereby to make way to introduce what Religion they please, without so
much as the necessity of the consent of the Nation by their Estates in
Parliament. Whilst we consider and ponder these things as we cannot but be
touched with a tender sense of those miseries, so the giving such a remedy to
them as may be proper and may answer the expectation of all good men, and true
Protestants, is the great thing which we propose to our selves in this
undertaking: the Equity where of will be justified to the world, if what has
been acted at the instigation of those Evil Councillors be further
impartially weighed.

It is well known, that the Laws, Privileges and Rights of the Kingdom have
been overturned to the great prejudice of King and people, whilst thus all
foundation of confidence and trust is removed. And it is no less known what
have been the Arbitrary procedures of an encroaching Privy Council; for
although by the Laws enacted by the authority of King and Parliament, it is
expressly prohibited that the Popish Religion should be professed or Seminary
Priests suffered within the Kingdom, or that the children of any Noblemen or
Gentlemen should be sent abroad to be educated in Popish Colleges; yet have
these Evil Councillors ordered or suffered young Noblemen to be taken from
their relations, and to be sent abroad to be instructed in Jesuits Colleges,
and have likewayes caused Schools to be erected under the conduct of Popish
Priests, and that in the Capital City of the Kingdom.

In an open contempt also of the known Laws of the Kingdom, Papists are put
into places of Highest Trust both Civil and Military, and entrusted with all
the Forts and Magazins. The rights and Privileges of the Royal Burrows, the
Third Estate of Parliament, having as many Deputies in it as all the Shires in
the Kingdom, are taken away, and they hindered in the free election of their
Magistrates and Town-Councells, to the manifest violation of their Charters,
established by Law and Immemoriall possession. And all this is done by mere
Arbitrary power without any Citation, Trial or Sentence.

And whereas no Nation whatsoever can subsist without the administration of
good and impartial Justice, upon which men's Lives and Liberties their Honors
and Estates depend, yet those Evil Councillors have subjected these to an
Arbitrary and Despotick power: having turned out Judges, who by Law ought to
continue during their Life or their good behavior, becase they would not
conform themselves to their Intentions, and put others in their Places, who
they believe would be more complyant, and that without any regard to their
abilities: by which it evidently appears that those Evil Councillors design
to render themselves the Absolute Masters of the Lives, Honors and Estates of
the subjects, without being restrained by any rule or Law.

By the inflence of the same Evil Counselors has a most exorbitant power
been exercised in imposing Bonds and Oaths upon whole Shires without any Law or
Act of Parliament: in permitting Free quarters to the soldiers, although they
had a sufficient Establisment for their pay, whereby the Kingdom was doubly
burdened without any redres; in imprisoning Gentlemen without any, so much as
alleged, Reason, for ceing many to accuse and witness against themselves,
imposing arbitrary fines, frighting and harassing many parts of the Country
with Intercommoning and Justice-Aires, making some incur forfeiture of life
and fortune for the most general and harmless converse even with their nearest
relations outlawed. And thus bringing a consternation upon a great part of the
Kingdom, which when Outlawries and Intercommonings went out against multitudes
upon the slenderest pretexts, was involved so universally in that danger, that
those Councillors themselves were so obnoxious as to find it necessary to have
Pardons and Indemnities, whilst the poor people were left to mercy; impowering
Officers and Soldiers to Act upon the subjects living in quiet and full peace,
the greatest Barbarities, in destroying them by hanging, shooting and drouwning
them without any form of Law, or respect to Age or Sex, not giving some of
them time to pray to God for mercy: And this for no other reason but because
they would not answer or satisfy them in such questions as they proposed to
them without any warrant of Law, and against the Common Interest of Mankind,
which frees all men from being obliged to discover their secret thoughts;
Besides a great many other Violences and Oppressions, to which that poor Nation
has been exposed without any hope of having an end put to them, or to have
Relief from them.

And that the Arbitrary and Illegal proceedings of those Evil Councillors
might be justified and supported, such a Declaration has been procured by
them, as strikes at the root of the Government, and overturns the most sacred
Rights of it, in making all Parliaments unnecessary, and taking away all
defenses of Religion, Liberty and Property, by an assumed and asserted Absolute
Power, to which Obedience is required without Reserve: which every good
Christian is persuaded to be due to God Almighty alone, all whose Commandments
are always Just and Good.

These Evil Councillors have used their utmost endeavors to abolish Penal
Laws excluding all who are not Protestants from public Trust, which give too
great a check to their designs. For the accomplishing of this a Liberty has
been granted to Dissenters, but such a^one, as that the continuance thereof is
plainly insinuated to depend upon their hearty concurrence for Abolishing the
abovementioned Penal Laws, the only legal defense of their Religion; Although
the Dissenters have just cause of distrust when they call to mind how some
hundreds of their Ministers were driven out of their Churches without either
accusation or citation: the filling of many of whose places with Ignorant and
Scandalous persons has been one great occasion of all those Miseries which
that Country for a long time has Groaned under. And Dissenters have but small
ground to rest on any present ease founded upon a Proclamation which may be
recalled every hour, and which in the first and second Editions of it gave no
relief to them, especially considering that not many monts before, the greatest
of the forementioned severities and barbarities had been exercised upon them.

But to crown all, there are great and violent Presumptions, inducing us to
believe, that those Evil Councillors, in order to the carrying on of their
ill designs, and to the gaining to themselves the more time for the Effecting
of them, for the encouraging of their Accomplices, and for the discouraging of
all Good Subjects, have published that the Queen has brought forth a Son: tho
there have appeared both during the Queens pretended Bigness, and in the manner
in which the Birth was managed, so many just and visible grounds of suspicion,
that not only We our selves, but all the good Subjects of those Kingdoms do
vehemently suspect, that the pretended Prince of Wales was not born by the
Queen. And it is notoriously known to all the world, that many both doubted of
the Queens Bigness, and of the Birth of the Child, and yet there was not any one
thing done to satisfy them, or to put an end to their Doubts.

And since our Dearest and most Entirely Beloved Consort, the Princess, and
likewise We our selves, have so great an Interest in this Matter, and such a
Right, as all the world knows, to the succession of these Kingdoms, which
those Men have attempted to violate, for preventing of all redress of miseries,
by the lawful Successors of the Crown, educated by the good providence of God,
in the true Profession of the Protestant Religion, We cannot excuse our selves
from espousing the true interest of these Nations in matters of such high
Consequence, and from contributing all that lies in us, for the defense of the
Laws and Liberties thereof, the maintaining of the Protestant Religion in them,
and the securing of the People in the enjoyment of all their just Rights.

But that our Intentions may be so manifest that no person may doubt or pretend
to doubt thereof, to excuse themselves from concurringh with us in this just
Design for the Universal good of the Nation. We do Declare that the freeing
that Kingdom from all hazard of Popery and Arbitrary power for the future, and
the delivering it from what at the present does expose it to both, the settling
of it by Parliament upon such a solid Basis as to its Religions and Civil
concerns as may most effectually redress all the above mentioned Grievances,
are the true reasons of our present undertaking as to that Nation,

And therefore We persuade our selves that our Endeavors to give the best
assistance we can for the Relief of so distressed a Kingdom, shall not only
not be misconstrued, but shall also be accompanied with a cheerful and
universal Concurrence of the whole Nation, that even those who have been
Instruments for the enslaving of it, will now show their Dislike of what they
have done, by their timeous and reasonable Diligence for its Rescue; and that
if any shall not give us that Assistance which their Conscience to God, and
their Respect to their Country oblige them to, they shall be justly charged
with all the Evils that may be the effects of such a want of their duty.

And as we our selves desire to trust to the Almighty God alone for the
success of our Arms, so we expect of all good men, that they will apply
themselves most earnestly to Him for his Blessing upon our Endeavors, that so
they may rend to the Glory of his Great Name, to the Establishment of the
Reformed Churches, and to the Peace and Happiness of that Kingdom.

To all Commanders of Ships and all Seamen that are now employed in the English
Fleet.
GENTLEMEN AND FRIENDS,
OUr Right Trusty and Well beloved Admiral Herbert is fully Instructed by Us:
And therefore We expect that you will give an Entire credit, to every thing
that he shall say to you in our Name: We have prepared a Declaration,
containing the Reasons that induce Us to undertake the Present Expedition, in
which We have no other design but the preservation of the Protestant
Religion, and the restoring of the Laws and Liberties of England. The total
ruin of your Religion being as much designed by the Papists in England, as it
is already accomplished in France; and it will as certainly be effected, if
they are able to prevail at this time.

We can not believe, but that you must be already sensible, that you are only
made use of as Instruments, to bring both your selves and your Country under
Popery and Slavery, by the means both of the Irish and the Foreigners who are
preparing to complete your Destruction. And therefore We hope that God will
put it in your hearts at this time, to Redeem your selves, your Country and
your Religion from all those Miseries.

This in all humane appearance can only be done, by your coming now to assist
Us, who are laboring for your Deliverance. And We do assure you that We
will be ever mindful of the services that youw shall now do Us: And We
promise to you that We will place particular marks of our Favor on all those
who will upon this Occasion deserve well of Us and of the Nation, We are with
all sincerity Your truly well wishing and affectionate Friend

Given at Our Court at Dieren the 29. day of Septembre 1688. WILLIAM H: PRINCE
OF ORANGE.
By his Highnesses special command C: HUYGENS.

To all the Officers and Soldiers in the English Army.
GENTLEMEN AND FRIENDS.
We have given so true and so full an account of our Intentions in this
Expedition, in our Declaration, that as We can add nothing to it, so We are
sure that you can desire nothing more of Us. We come to preserve your
Religion, and to restore and establish your Liberties and Properties: and
therefore We can not suffer our selves to doubt, but that all Protestants and
true Englishmen will come and concur with us in our designs to secure these
Nations from Popery and Slavery. You must all see plainly, that you are made
use of only as Instruments, to enslave the Nation and to ruin the Protestant
Religion: and when that is done you may judge what you your selves ought to
expect, both by the casheering of all the Protestant and English Officers and
Soldiers in Ireland, and by the Irish Soldiers that are brought over to be
put in your places, of which you have seen so fresh an Instance, that we need
not put you in mind of it. You know how many of your Fellow Officers have been
used, only for their Standing firm to the Protestant Religion and to the Laws
of England: and you can not flatter your selves so far, as to expect to be
better used, if those who have broke their word so often, should by your means be
brought out of the straits, to which they are reduced at present.

We hope likewise, that you will not suffer your selves to be abused by a
false notion of Honor: but that you will in the first place consider what you
owe to Almighty God and your Religion, to your Country, to your selves and to
your Posterity: which you as men of Honor ought to prefer to all Private
Considerations and Engagements whatsoever. We do therefore expect, that you
will consider the Honor that is now set before you, of being the Instruments
of saving your Country and of securing your Religion. We will ever remember
the services that you shall do upon this occasion: and We promise to you,
that We will place such particular marks of our Favor on every one of you,
as your behavior at this time shall deserve of us, and of the Nation, in which
We will make a great distinction of those, that shall come seasonably to join
their Arms with Ours. And you shall ever find us to be Your Well VVishing and
assured Friend

WILLIAM HENRY, PRINCE OF ORANGE.
By his Highnesses special command C: HUYGENS.

A Prayer for the present Expedition.
ALmighty God, the Lord of Hosts, and the aid and refuge of all that trust in
thee, We humbly pray thee, to bless and prosper this Undertaking, for the
glory of thy Name, and for the good of thy People: Let not our sins provoke
thee, to deny thy blessing to thy Servant the PRINCE, compass him with thy
favor as with a shield: Direct him in all his Councels, and be thou ever
present with him and assisting to him in all his Actions: that so he may be
Successful in this great Design: and that he may Employ all the power, that
thou puts in his hands, to the honor of thy Great Name, to the establishing
and advancing of thy true Religion, and to the Procuring of the peace and
Happiness of these Nations: Bless both the Army and Fleet under his Command,
with Success and Victory. And grant o Gracious God that all of us, may be
turning to thee, with our whole hearts; Repenting us truly of all our past
sins, and solemnly vowing to thee, as we now do, that we will in all time
coming, amend our lives, and endeavor to carry our selves as becomes Reformed
Christians. And that we will show our Zeal for our holy Religion by living in
all things suteably to it. Hear us Holy Father, and set thy Angels to encamp
round about us, for we put our whole trust in thy Protection and Defense,
which we humbly pray thee to grant us, for the sake of Jesus Christ our only
Savior and Redeemer.

Amen.
