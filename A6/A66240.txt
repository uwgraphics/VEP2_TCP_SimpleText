Observe strict Discipline, and for Payment of Quarters.
MARIE R.

TO the end Our Forces may be kept in good Order anb Discipline, and Our
Subjects not suffer by any Disorders or Misbehaviour of any Officers and
Soldiers within Our Pay and Entertainment, We have thought fit hereby to
Declare Our Royal Will and Pleasure, That in what Place soever any of Our
Forces shall Pass or Remain, they shall duly Pay their Quarters according to
the Instructions We have given them for that purpose; which said Instructions
We have Commanded the Colonel or Officer in Chief with any Regiment, Troop or
Company, to Communicate and Publish to the Chief Magistrate of the City, Town
or Village where he is or shall be Quartered, and also to all others who shall
be concerned, as soon as he Marches into the same, beyond which no Officer or
Private Soldier is to be Trusted on any Account or Pretense whatsoever, in
their said Quarters. And whereas We have already Charged and Required the
Officers of Our Army to make or cause Satisfaction to be made for all Injuries
already done by themselves, or Soldiers under their Command, upon Pain of Our
heavy Displeasure; So We do for the future strictly Forbid all Our said
Officers and Soldiers to Use any Violence or Threatening Words to any Person
whatsoever, or give any Offense or just cause of Complaint.

And in case any of Our said Officers or Soldiers shall presume to Commit any
Spoil or Disorder, or use any Violence or Threatening Words, or otherwise
Misbehave themselves, We do hereby further Declare, That besides the ordinary
Course of Justice for Redress, if the Persons agrieved shall make known the
same to the Superior Officers, the said Officers shall, and are hereby
Required to cause Satisfaction immediately to be made, and that if such
Officers to whom Complaint is made, shall Forbear or Delay the causing due
Satisfaction to be given, as aforesaid, the Persons to whom Wrong is done, are
to make their further Complaint to any two Justices of the Peace of the
Country, City, or Place where the Offense is Committed, which said Justices We
do Require to represent the same forthwith to Us, that We may order speedy
Justice to be done by Reparation of the Injury, and causing the Officers and
Soldiers so offending, to be Punished as the Nature and Quality of their
Offenses shall deserve. And We do further Declare Our Will and Pleasure to be,
That no Officer or Soldier in their March or Quarters shall be Lodged in any
Private House whatsoever, without the Free and Voluntary Consent of the Owner,
and that in case any Officers or Soldiers shall for any Reward or
Consideration, Leave or Change the Quarters appointed them, or shall Demand or
Exact Money for Quarters, or to Exempt any Person from the same, they shall be
Punished by Cashiering and loss of their Pay. And We do likewise strictly
Prohibit and Forbid all Officers and Soldiers to Destroy or Disturb the Game in
any manner whatsoever, whthout Leave from Us, the Lords of the respective
Manors, or others to whom it may belong to grant the same, it being Our Royal
Intention and Command, That all Officers and Soldiers in Our Service behave
themselves Orderly in all things, according to Law and Military Discipline, as
becomes them, upon Pain of the severest Consequences of Our High Displeasure.
