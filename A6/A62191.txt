A SATYR.
HIS Holiness has Three Grand Friends
On Great Britain shore,
That prosecute his (and their own) ends,
A D. a Judge, and a Whore.
The D. is as true as Steel
To the Pope, that Infallible Elf;
Therefore no Friend to the Common Weal,
Nor no Friend unto himself.
The Judge is a Butchers Son,
Yet hates to shed innocent Blood,
But for Ten thousand pound has done
The Pope a great deal of good.
He that Villain Wakeman cleared,
Who was to have Poisoned the King,
As it most plainly appeared;
For which he deserves to swing.
Portsmouth, that Pocky-Bitch,
A Damned Papistical-Drab,
An ugly deformed Witch,
Eaten up with the Mange and Scab.
This French Hag's Pocky Bumb
So powerful is of late;
Although it is both Blind and Dumb,
It Rules both Church and State.
