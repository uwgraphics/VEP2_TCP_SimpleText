SINS DISCOVERY BY THE EMBLEM OF A TOAD.
depiction of a man More Loathsome* What can be unto mine eye*
Than this most ugly Toade which here J spy.



A TOADE
Though J be object of man's scorn and hate.
Yett J am better than A Reprobate.





POor man, why, with disdain do look on Me?
Thy self more vile, by Sin, why do not See?
A Toade I am, yet serve God in my kind,
Accomplishing those Ends to me Assigned.
My place I keep, where God appointed me,
From Earth that Venom, I ^uck-up, which Thee
And Beasts would hurt: and yet my poyson's good
For Medicines, were it rightly understood,
And with this poison though my self, I fill,
Its that which can the body only kill,
And makes me loathsome unto mortal Eyes
But, with me all my shame and sorrow dies.
But thou rebell'st against Gods majesty,
And serv'st the Devil his damned Enemy.
With filthy Lusts (worst Poison) filled thou art,
Which makes Jehova loath thee with his heart
Thy poisons worse, ten thousand times than mine
Which only does the body kill; but thine
The soul, likewise; and if in sin thou die,
Death does not end thy shame and misery,
It (then) begins; which (once) but felt and seen,
A loathsome Toad, like me, thou wilt wish, thou would been,
Then thou will find thy state, than mine far worse,
Since, ugly-Sinne made Christ become a Curse
And that man's Sin caused all that misery,
Which Christ endured from Cratch to Crused-Tree.
Yea, that each wilful, unrepented Sin,
Does horror here, and hell hereafter win.
Sin, therefore, worse than Plagues, death, hell, the devil,
Cause of all ill, hate, as the greatest; evil,
And if thou (ere) wilt enter Heavens straight Gate
Let Sins not Toades, be object of thy hate.
F. P.
