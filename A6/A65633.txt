The Whigg-Feast: A SCOTCH BALLAD,
made to the Tune of a new and pleasant Scotch Dance.
I.
WOons! what no is the matter?
Good feth'tis wondrous strange,
The Whigs do keep sike a clatter,
That nean can pass the Exchange.
They cry, 'Bread! it is pity
Their Numbers are no more,
The DUKE does dine in the City,
And muckle they fear His Power.
They begin the awd Trick again,
And cabal like Old-Nick again,
Feast three hundred pound thick again,
Sike a height they soar:
Ah, bonny London! thou 'rt undone,
If e're thou art in their power.
II.
The wise old E -- with the Spigot,
That never knew rest or ease,
Udsbread! is grown sike a Bigot,
The Nation has his Disease.
More of the Tribe I can name ye,
That make this Raree-Show,
Bold George, and Politic Jemmy,
Converted by Doctor T O.
Both the Sheriffs there should ha bin,
Then how merry they would ha bin,
Met for National Good again,
As they were before:
Ah, bonny London! thou 'rt undone,
If long thou art in their power.
III.
More to show us what Ninneys
Are all rebellious Beasts,
The Cuckolds sent in their Guinneys,
To make this Jolly Feast.
Never caring, or thinking,
What Insolence was done,
Or that their Plotting and Drinking
Should e're be opposed so soon.
But when they knew they were barred again,
They sent out the Black Guard again,
All our Bonfires were marred again,
Slaves did shout and roar:
Ah, bonny London! thou 'rt undone,
If e're thou art in their power.
IV.
Right and Royalty governs,
Which Rebels would overthrow;
They once were fatal to Sovereigns,
Ah, let 'em no more be so!
But to baffle Oppression,
Inspired by Fate Divine,
Defend the Crown and Succession,
And keep it in the Right Line.
Every Soldier will fight for it,
Each bold Genius will write for it,
And the Whigs hang in spite for it,
Losing Regal Power:
And, bonny London, they are undone,
That thought to usurp once more.
London, Printed for Joseph Hindmarsh at the Black-Bull in Cornhill. 1682.
