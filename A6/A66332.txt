WE being desirous that the Members of both Houses may have convenient Notice
of the time when their Attendance in Parliament will be requisite, to the end
they may order their Affairs so as that there may then be a full Assembly, Have
(with the Advice of Our Privy Council) thought fit to Issue this Our Royal
Proclamation; hereby Declaring and Publishing Our Will and Pleasure, That Our
Parliament shall on the Third Day of October next (to which Day the same is now
Prorogued) be further Prorogued unto Thursday the Six and twentieth Day of
October next. In Order to which Prorogation We shall Expect the Attendance only
of such Members as shall be resident in or near Our Cities of London and
Westminster. And Our Purpose being that Our said Houses of Parliament shall not
only Meet upon the said Six and twentieth Day of October next, but shall Sit
for the Dispatch of diverse Weighty and important Affairs, We do therefore
hereby Charge and Require all the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the
Knights, Citizens and Burgesses of the House of Commons to give their
Attendance at Westminster on the said Six and twentieth Day of October next
accordingly.
