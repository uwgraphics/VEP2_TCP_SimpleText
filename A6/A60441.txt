THE MEDITATIONS Of an HUMBLE HEART. Written only for FRIENDS, who can read it.
To the Undefiled of God, Elect, Chosen and Precious.
ELect, Chosen and Precious, whom God has loved, and does love, and cannot but
love from Everlasting to Everlasting, with an Everlasting Infinite Love:
who art the most delightsom Plant, of most Honorable Renown; renowned with
honorable Dignity for ever; the Delight of all the Upright, the Life of all
the Virtuous, the Spouse of all the Unwedded Undefiled Virgins; the Staff of
Abraham's Strength, the Bread of Jacobs Soul, the Succor of Joseph in time of
need, the Mouth of Moses Wisdom, the Rock of Isreal's Strength, the certain
Hiding Place of all the Troubled, the House of all the former scattered, the
Bed of Repose wherein the beautified Damsels fill themselves with the solace of
most heavenly divine Delights, whose Beauty surpasses expressions of words,
whose tender Offers have invited many, whose Love has allured the hearts of
thousands, whose pleasant Countenance has prevailed with a numberless number
to love thee for ever; whose pleasant Smiles have gathered unto thee
innumerable Doves of the Wilderness, and thy Virtue has caused the barren
desolate to bring forth both Bud, Blossom and Fruit in abundance; the Breath of
thy Nostrils has enlivened the Dead, the sound of thy Voice has quickened the
Weary, and by thy Power has the Barren brought forth in abundance, whereby the
Earth has been covered with thy fruitful Riches; Thou art clothed with
Innocence for ever, Thy dwelling is hid from all the disobedient children of
men, Thou have bound thy self (to live out of their sight) with thy Darlings in
a stronger Covenant than all Marriages; Thou deckest thy Beloved for thy self,
and then thou delightest in her; Thou preparest thy Spouse for the joy of thy
heart, and then love her because of her beauty; Thou deckest her with
Ornaments of well-refined Gold, and causest her face to shine; Thou fillest her
with Glory within, and causest her to dwell among the Honorable, and walk with
the choicest Virgins in the Paths of great delight, and she is become the
Daughter of the King of kings; Thy Goodness does much overcome the hearts of
many, thy Wisdom pleases the Prudent; thy Meekness delights hundreds, thy
Strength upholdeth an infinite number, and thy Life nourishes thousands; thou
renewest the strength of the Faint, thou turnest the shadow of Death into a
Morning, thou keep thy Flock under the shadow of thy Wing, and nourishest
them with the choicest Food; thou guidest them with the hand of thy Power, and
succourest them at every needful time, and thou relievest their greatest wants:
the consideration of thee (which brings thy Goodness into remembrance) even
fills the hearts of the Flock of thy Fold, and thou art He who only
satisfies them for ever.

Oh! where wast thou in the day of Adversity, and where was thy dwelling in the
time of the Night? Where did thou hide thy self in the day of Transgression,
and to what place did thou confine thy self when Iniquity ruled? and what was
thy state in the time of man's Sin? Ah! how wast thou then as a slain Lamb, and
as a meek Prince deprived of his Kingdom and Government? how wast thou, as a
true Heir deprived of his Right, and as an only Son from the Father's House,
and found not wherein to rest thy head? How wast thou grieved in that day, and
how wast thou wounded by thy pretended friends? how was thy Glory defamed, and
thy Honor laid aside? how was thy Beauty marred, and thy Wisdom bound up as in
an obscure place? how did Darkness compass about thy dwelling? how was thy
Strength put by, and thy Comeliness, as if it had not been? Wast thou not as in
a Grave in the midst of all the wicked? and wast not thou taken in their pits,
and lay long slain in the streets of the Sodomites, and exiled as the greatest
Captives.

Oh! where did thou hide thy self when the Dragon cast forth his flood, when
the Waves swelled, and when the Land was fruitless, when the Birth failed in
the Womb, when the Seed came not to maturity; when the Blade was killed in the
Spring, when the sharp nipping Frost cut down the head of the tender Herb; when
the Winter nights were long, when the boistrous Storms were many; when the
whole Earth was covered with thick darkness, when the Heavens were as Brass;
when the Rain descended not, when the distilling Dews came not down; when the
Blossom withered in the time of drouth, when the Path to dwell in was not
known; when the Stars shone not, when all the Lights of Heaven were eclipsed;
when the Voice of the Shepherd was not known, when the Eye of the Travellor was
dim; when none could direct him in his Way, nor supply him with Food for his
Journey, nor Water in his greatest thirst, nor succor him in the time of the
Storm, when he knew not the end of his Journey, neither perceived the way to
go, nor ever could have rest till he came there; when the feet of the Virgin
stuck in the mire, and the Youngman failed of strength; when no way was known
but a Wilderness, when no succor was found but a Forest of most fearful
devouring Beasts; when the Scorpians did bite in the daytime, when the Lion
did roar in the night; when the Dragon was near to devour, when the Wolf yelled
for his Prey; when the Foxes spoiled the tender Grapes, when the brazen Serpent
could not be seen; when thy Lambs cried as in the day of forgetfulness, when
the Young lamented the birth for want of the food; when thy Damsels fainted
with thirst, when pity was not to be found amongst men; when Mercy could not be
seen in Heaven, neither would the Earth open her mouth and swallow up to end
the state of Misery; when this day of Jacobs trouble was as in a Whirlwind, or
as a combustious Thunder in the midst of heat and cold, which none does know
but the man that has seen it; who in the bitterness of his soul has long
traveled as a Woman in her sore pangs of Sorrow, through the Warfare, in the
grievous troublesome day of distress?

Oh! how wast thou then as a Prisoner in the Pit, and where was thy place to be
found, or who could search out thy dwelling? O Thou! now, well known to be, the
much more than the threefold, Chiefest of ten thousand hundred thousand, and of
thousands of thousands! to whom my soul's love can never be expressed.

Arise now thou Meek One of Wisdom, speak forth thy self in thy own Virtue; let
thy Spouse hear thy Voice and rejoice in thee for evermore, whom thou have
fitted for thy self, a chaste comely Virgin, to shine forth thy Glory in for
ever: for thy Beauty has often filled my heart with precious Oil, and the
Desire of Thee has drawn me out of my self; my lips at first have stammered at
thy presence, but thou have healed the wounded heart: Thou art the chiefest of
all Delights, and happy are all them that know thee.

To the Espoused Virgin.
Arise out of the dust, awake as in the days of old; let thine Eye be more
bright with the Light of the Day than in the Ages past; adorn thy self with
Comeliness, deck thee with Ornaments, prepare thee with sweet Ointments; put on
Beauty as a Beam of the Morning, shine forth as the fairness of the Sun; enrobe
thee with Righteousness as with a Garment, and deck thy self with precious
Jewels as the choicest Bride; grow up as the tender Plant, spring forth as the
Lilly; blossom as the Rose, be fruitful as the Vine; grow up as the Cedar,
spread as the Vine-branches; let Salvation be the Wall on which thou layest
hold, come forth as the increasing Herbs of the field, with many stems from one
root, and many branches on every stem, and many blossoms on every branch, and
(much more) many seeds of fruitful increase under or after every blossom, that
the Sower may be made glad with the abundance of the increase thereof; that the
good Husbandman may rejoice in his labor, that the Planter may delight in the
works of his hands.

Let thy Fruit be as of an Apple Tree, whose boughs therewith does bend; let
the taste thereof be as sweet as the Honey, and the smell thereof as the sweet
Odor; let thy Boldness appear as the Morning, and thy Meekness as the Baytree
that is always green; be more fruitful than Labanon; let no Female that God
has made bring forth the fruit of her womb more often than thee; in labor be
more diligent than the Ant; in multiplying bring forth more often than the
chiefest of the Conies, though she make her Nest in the Rock; in fragrant smell
let not the sweetest Flower or Ointment surpass thee; in Beauty let nothing
exceed thee; in Meekness come not short of Sarah; in Wisdom and Prudence let
neither Abigail, Ruth, Esther, nor Mary excel thee; receive thy Beloved as the
choicest of Princes, and embrace him in the Arms of Righteousness for ever:
bring forth according to his Nature, and let thy increase be of his own Image;
keep clean thy Garments, let not thy Beauty be spoiled; defile not thy breath
with the Garlic of Egypt, nor thy taste with the Grapes of Sodom; drink not any
thing down which may defile the savor of thy breath that may offend thy
Prince, neither let any Covering remain upon thee, which may cause him the less
to love thee; let all thy ways be pleasant to Him, and all thy Robes
delightsom in his Eye; let thy footsteps be ordered as in the sight of the
King, and let thy words be grave and sound, which may not offend Him, that His
Love may both continue and increase toward thee, and He delight in thee and
rejoice over thee, and the smiles of His Countenance fully gratify thee for
all the frowns of thy (former) now forsaken lovers; that thy daily delight may
be in Him for ever, and flourish under his Arm as the beautiful Rose of Sharon,
with its blossom of many doubles, and remain fruitful as the Olive Tree for
ever.

So will the King delight in thy beautiful Excellency, and so shall the Prince
be satisfied with thy fruitful Virtue; thy Arm shall gather thee Riches, and
thy Faithfulness shall give thee strength; thy Boughs shall reach over the
Earth, thy spreading shall be over the Sea, and thy Fruit shall shine afar off;
thy Root shall remain firm and steadfast, thy Branches shall enlarge
themselves, and the weak shall lay hold on thy skirts; thy Leaves shall be
pleasant to many, and thy Sap shall ever spring up from the Root; thou shall
never be forsaken in the troublesome Night, nor removed with the greatest
Storm, nor overturned with Wind or Sea, but shall be kept from the darkness
which thou host seen.

Hereby let all the Barren hear the Voice of the fruitful Vine, and she that
sat in the desolate place come to see the Light of the Morning; and let the
Spouse be prepared and the Virgin adorned; and let the Voice of Meekness be
heard in the solitary place, and Life spring forth as the Noonday, that the
Prisoner may come out of the Pit to sit in his Throne for ever, and the Captive
from Exile to the Enlargedness of Dominion; that the Bounds may be broken, and
the boundless known where no limit is.

Something how the Marriage of the Undefiled Lamb, and the Virgin came at first
to be.
The slain thing had God's Power in it, even in that state; and when it became
as a servant, because of man's Sin, in the great service of love to help man
out of Sin, who has power both to serve and to rule; both to lay down his
Life, and to take it up again; who in himself is still the same, and his Power
is exercised in his Suffering as well as in his Ruling; or, as when He
exercises his Power in Ruling: And He that was dead is alive, and He has
taken unto Him his Great Power, and does reign over the Creature and the Sin
(having done it away) with the same Power, whereby before he came so to serve
man under the Sin, as to help him from under it, and so to bring man with
himself, in his Power, as it suffered by the Sin, out of the Sin, and out of
that Power which captivated under, or into the committing of Sin, and so to the
end of it, with Christ over it to live and reign for ever, as it is received in
that way, manner and operation which at first it does come and show forth it
self in the Power of its sufferings, whose Power and Virtue therein at first is
known: and so such who know Him in his suffering-state, He permits, chooses
and electeth to live and reign with Him in His Ruling-state.

And so he that has power to Reign, has power to Suffer, and so to Suffer
that he may Reign, the exercise of whose power in his Suffering is in order to
his Reigning, and such as feel, know, and receive his power first enabling them
with him to suffer, they with the same are brought to the end of sin and
sinning, by which the suffering came upon the Just for the unjust, and as man
to this is joined in his sufferings, its power works man's Redemption (and so
not of man) or brings man back from under that power which held in the
Transgression and Separation, from the Bridegroom of the soul, and takes away
that which captivates it, and so breaks the wall which stood between the
desired Liberty and the present Bondage, and so brings the true and lasting
Peace; and so both receive each other, and are made one in each other, (and not
otherwise) It is certainly so.

And that man which truly Suffered with it, Reigns with it, who was joined to
it in its Suffering, till it come to Reign, and then to submit unto it and
serve it, in its Motions, Leadings, Rulings, and Governings, in the power of
its Love, which wins the heart so to do, as the chaste wife to the husband,
so with it, in the power of it, man comes to Reign over that which was both
contrary to it, and to the upright hearted man, until all its enemies are put
under it, and so under the man that is one with it, and whose Life is in it,
being truly joined to it of the Lord, (then not to be put asunder) and so
loving of it, and in all things submitting to it, more than the true chaste
Virgin to the Husband, living in the power, and the power living in man, and so
both becoming one in Sufferings, one in Trials, one in Tribulations, one in
Afflictions, one in Joy, one in Peace, one in Liberty, one in Captivity, one in
Riches, one in Poverty: And so truly one, partaking with each other, in all
states unseparable, may well in some measure be termed, The Marriage of the
Lamb which is come, (and more of it may be known) and the Virgin being thus and
more fully espoused, to the undefiled, unspotted of God, they are thus far made
one, and she becomes the Daughter of the Husbands Father, the King of kings, or
the Adopted Child of God.

And thus the undefiled One of God and the Virgin of Sion, becomes one in the
unspeakable Unity, which Unity being felt, both as one, (perceive me) and my
Lines are understood, and my Words received in love.

And this is written and sent forth among all Friends, who desire to hear of
me, and who have known me in the invisible Truth, and such to whom the Lord
has made me serviceable in the precious things of the Kingdom of God, which is
of Peace and Righteousness, where my Rest is; that hereby they may hear from
me, and know that I remain in the labor of the Gospel (which is very great)
and in the Fellowship of the Saints: Your Brother in the unexpressable Love of
the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior, Called HUMPHREY SMITH.
From Cogshal in Essex (in which parts very many of late have received the
precious Truth) the twelfth day of the fifth month, (61.) And this may be read
in such Meetings where and when Friends of the Ministry are wanting.
