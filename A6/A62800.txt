To the Right Honorable Members of the High Court of Parliament for the
Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland.
The humble Petition of diverse Prisoners in the Fleet
SHOWS:
THat your Petitioners by the oppression of their cruel Adversaries and
Creditors, and policy of subtle Attorneys and Solicitors adhering to them,
are upon Judgments, Executions, Contempts, and Decrees, surruptitiously
obtained, most unjustly imprisoned, and that the Judges now appointed have no
power upon the same to relieve them; some of which Judgments, Executions,
Contempts, and Decrees are upon pretended Debts, where nothing is due, others
for far greater sums then are due, or your Petitioners able to pay, by which
means they are bereft of their Estates, credits, and employments, to the utter
ruin of themselves and families.

That whereas many of your Petitioners who formerly lived comfortably, and in
these sad times of War have been utterly undone (should be the objects of Mercy
and pity) yet they find nothing but the Rigor of the Law executed upon them,
to the satisfaction of Obdurate Creditors and misery of your undone Petitioners.

That the remainder of the Estates of your poor petitioners undone as aforesaid
by judgments, Executions etc. being so obtained, must go to satisfy one man
only, whereas many other consciencions Creditors, some perhaps as poor as
your Petitioners not having obtained that advantage must have no satisfaction.

Your Petitioners humbly pray, that the Judges appointed may have power to
right and free them from the said Judgments, Executions, Contempts, and
Decrees, so unjustly gotten (which power given them by the said Act) is
abridged and taken away by the Ordinance; your Petitioners through restraint
wanting means to relieve themselves by course of Law, and that those who have
been ruinated by Sea and Land by the sad accidents of War, may have Equity
according to conscience, and not the rigor of Law to pass upon them, and that
those who have nothing to satisfy, or are willing to part with what they have,
may be discharged, according to the late Act as poor, and that the
compassionate Creditor, as well as cruel, may have their equal proportions.

And your Petitioners shall ever pray, etc.
