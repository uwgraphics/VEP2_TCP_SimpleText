LONDON, Printed for JOHN GREENSMITH, 1642.

A Terrible PLOT Against the City of London and Westminster.
THe papists have envied the prosperity of this Kingdom a long time, and have
daily studied to kindle a fire of dissension, and distraction among the true
protestants, and have diligently plotted to bring the whole State of this
Nation to a destructive ruin. Their Councels have bin always employed to
advance the court of rome, and their popish Hierarchy, and as their Councels
have bin conjoined to depopulate this Realm, so their actions have been
sputred forward to a greater instigation thereof. Wherefore to bring their
nefarious intentions, and intestine conspiracy to some ripeness, and maturity
of perfection, they have oftentimes intruded themselves to become the Kings
favorites: that so by this means being advanced to places of great dignity,
and high command in this Kingdom, they might more easily execute their Plots
(which they have a long time hatched against us) and with greater felicity, Sir
William Balfour Lieutenant of the tower, having with great fidelity,
faithfulness of affection, and real zeal to the public good and
accommodation of this city of London, performed his Office very faithfully,
being a constant enemy to the papists, and their adherents, had some occasion
of necessity to go into Ireland, having a great estate there, and in great
danger to lose it, if he did any longer procrastinate the time: as soon
therefore as he was prepared to go, Col: Lunsford hearing of it, and obtaining
the letters of many popish Lords, he presented himself unto the King, as a
very true and loyal subject to his Majesty and the State: and thus by great
conivance he was elected to be Lientenant of the tower, although indeed he was
a great Signior of the Papists, stigmatized with the Papal Piploma, and a
second Faux or Executioner of their popish designs. Hereupon the Jesuits and
papists having their Romish Captains, and chief Conduct in so great a Command
of the City of London, did immediately convocate their Hell-nourished Councels,
and assembled themselves together at a public Mass, every one striving to
defend the Popes premacy, to enlarge his Kingdom, and by all possible means to
subvert and supplant this famous City of London, wherefore their resolutions
were thus molded, when as Col: Lunsford should have free liberty, and immunity
in the Tower, diverse of the Guard should be feed and suborned, having great
sums of money given them to conceal, and manage their Councels, and about the
dead time of the night they should place the Ordinance lower, and being charged
should incontinently blow up the City.

About which time of the night the other papists would provide a sudden Army,
and sufficient number of men to set Westminster and the Parliament house on
fire, and at the very same time they would provide shipping for the Archbishop
of Canterbury, Bishop Wren, and many other popish Doctors, who should have bin
all transported into Spain, where the one should have bin made a Cardinal,
and the other Sainted. Their design was sealed with an Oath, that every one
should be constant to Rome, and put this new-hatcht conspiracy into execution,
with all possible care and expedition. Whereupon eight of the Guard were sworn
to their machination, the Ordinance were in agitation to be suddenly placed
lower in the Tower against the City, and shipping was in great preparation for
the Arch prelate, and the other popish affected Doctors.

But mark the successelesse event of their wicked intentions, and nefarious
imaginations, and consider the miraculous providence of the mighty and Almighty
God, who delivered us from their cruel hands. The Apprentices having great
suspicion (as indeed they had great cause) of some treacherous plot which
hereby might ensue upon the City, did forthwith rise, and presented themselves
unto the Parliament, totally and universally petitioning against the papists,
and the Col: that was a papist in the Tower, showing that great danger the city
was in, Thus they went to Westminster to the parliament house 3 or 4 days
together, and were then unanimously resolved to pull him out of the Tovver,
which induced the King and Parliament immediately to displace him.

Thus we see how all the plots of the papists are brought to naught, and how
miraculously God has preserved us from all their conspiracies and impious
machinations: whose malicious envy has bin always kindled against us, yet
notwithstanding the flame of their sin-aspiring thoughts have bin quenched they
have diverse times came upon us like great Goliath threatening our perpetual
destruction, yet we like little David, have always become victorious, witness
that formidable Armado in 88. when like ravenous wolves they thought to have
devoured us, to the utter demolition of this whole kingdom, yet by the divine
providence assisting us, their whole Navy was dissipated, their forces
disjected, and repelled. Witness again that Hell-begotten Plot of Gunpowder
treason, when the King, Peers, and Commons of this Land had bin all blown up
with a stupendous sufflation to the eternal ruin of this whole Nation: yet
by Gods supreme omnipotency, when this Realm was almost at the last gasp,
when the divellish Plot was almost come to the last period, and execution
thereof, their conspiracy was miraculously discovered, themselves apprehended,
their Plot blasted, and the Actors thereof condemned, witness their open
rebellion in Ireland at this time, where they reign in trecheries and
conspiracies, whose disloyalty denies obedience to the Kings Imperial Crown
and Royal dignity, who wash their hands daily in the blood of Protestants, and
study with their cruelty to make a Sepulcher for the holy Gospel: but, we hope
as all their former trecheries have been confounded, so this especially will
suddenly be.

And finally witness those daily plots, which are found out amongst us here in
England, the Authors of all which have bin the Papists; who have most
nefariously conspired against this Kingdom, at sundry times, yet by Gods
providence all has come to naught, and this last amongst the other especially
against this famous City of London and Westminster have been confounded.

God grant that we may still be preserved and defended from all their plots,
Trecheries, and Conspiracies,

Amen.
FINIS.
