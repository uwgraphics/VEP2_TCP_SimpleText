The Trappan'd MAIDEN: OR, The Distressed Damsel.
This Girl was cunningly trappan'd,
Sent to Virginny from England;
Where she does Hardship undergo,
There is no Cure, it must be so:
But if she lives to cross the Main,
She vows she will never go there again.
Licensed and Entered according to Order.





GIve ear unto a Maid,
That lately was betrayed,
And sent into Virginy O:
In brief I shall declare,
What I have suffered there,
When that I was weary,
weary, weary, weary, O.
When that first I came
To this Land of Fame,
Which is called Virginny, O:
The Axe and the Hoe
Have brought my Overthrow,
When that, etc.
Five Years served I,
Under Master Guy,
In the Land of Virginny, O:
Which made me for to know,
Sorrow, Grief and Woe;
When that, etc.
When my Dame says, Go,
Then I must do so,
In the Land of Virginny, O:
When she sits at meat,
Then I have none to eat,
When that, etc.
The clothes that I brought in
They are worn very thin,
In the Land of Virginny, O:
Which makes me for to say,
Alas, and Well-a-day,
When that, etc.
Instead of Beds of ease,
To lie down when I please,
In the Land of Virginny, O:
Upon a Bed of Straw,
I lay down full of Woe,
When that I was weary,
weary, weary, weary, O.
Then the Spider she
Daily waits on me,
In the Land of Virginny, O:
Round about my Bed,
She spins her tender web,
When that I am weary,
weary, weary, weary, O.
So soon as it is day,
To work I must away,
the Land of Virginy, O;
Then my Dame she knocks
With her Tinder-box,
When that, etc.
I have played my part,
Both at Plow and Cart,
In the Land of Virginny, O:
Billets from the Wood,
Upon my back they load,
When that, etc.
Instead of drinking Beer,
I drink the water clear,
In the Land of Virginny, O:
Which makes me pale and wan,
Do all that ever I can,
When that, etc.
If my Dame says, Go,
I dare not say no,
In the Land of Virginny, O:
The Water from the Spring,
Upon my head I bring,
When that, etc.
When the Mill does stand,
I Am ready at command,
In the Land of Virginny, O:
The Mortar for to make,
Which made my heart to ache,
When that, etc.
When the Child does cry,
I must sing, By a by;
In the Land of Virginny, O;
No rest that I can have,
Whilst I am here a Slave,
When that, etc.
A thousand Woes beside,
That I do here abide,
In the Land of Virginny O:
In misery I spend
My time that has no end,
When that, etc.
Then let Maids beware,
All my by ill-fare,
In the Land of Virginny, O:
Be sure you stay at home,
For if you do here come,
You all will be weary, etc.
But if be my chance,
Homewards to advance,
From the Land of Virginny, O:
If that I once more
Land on English Shore;
I Will no more be weary,
weary, weary, weary, O.
