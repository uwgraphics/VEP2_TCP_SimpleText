THE Unjust Judge's CREED, REPLIED To Mr. EZEKIEL EDGWORTH, Archdeacon of
Newgate.
Qui Bavium non odit, amet tua carmina Maevi.
J. YOu rambled once, and seemed to say,
That Judges must be judged one day;
TO would fix on us such foul Disgraces,
To the mighty lessening of our Places.
Is It fit for Us to be controlled
By slavish Fear, so want bright Gold
From dangers distant, but how far
Could never be proved yet by you Sir?
What! shall not we Men hang, or quit,
Or Witness sham, as we think fit?
I tell thee, Priest, I Have Authors read,
And know as much as can be said;
Nought's after Death, Death's but a Puff,
A Groan, when Nature plays us off.
Let Us all lay by both Hope and Fear,
Of future State let us take no Care,
For we shall be but as we were.
Time still devours us, spite of Art,
And Death destroys our thinking part.
So the tale of Hell and the old grim Sir,
'Bout which you Black-Coats keep such stir,
Are but vain, empty, idle Dreams,
Arising from distempered Brains.

The Archdeacons ANSWER.
IF that be true your Lordship says,
You may, like Bulls, live Jovial Days:
Bulls only have the better on it,
You sometimes fear, which they do not.
Their Fronts are curled, though not with Care
Nor Choice, yet they have their entire share.
They court their Miss, their Meat, their Drink;
Thrice happy Brutes, they never think
Of Peace, or War, or Dutch, or French,
Or new Intrigue of Madam-Wench.
They careless are, how bought, how sold;
Or whether Tagus sands be Gold.
Hereafter (although) Death should be
An Inlet to Eternity,
Then your Lordship pays t'a farthing,
Both for Justice and your --
However, if it be as you divine,
The Hermit's as well's the Libertine.
For it is Futurity of State,
Distinguishing our unknown Fate,
That good from bad does separate.
Live then, My Lord, that you may've room
To hope, not fear, a State to Come.

FINIS.
