And whereas other unlearned and evil dispo^sed persons, have not sticked to
instille and whisper into men's ears, and to persuade abroad, evil and
perilous opinions, against Gods law, and the good order of the realm: some
teaching that a man may forsake his wife, and mary another, his first wife
yet living, and likewise that the wife may do to the husband. Other, that a
man may have two wifes, or mo at once, and that these things be prohibited,
not by Gods law, but by the Bisshopp of Romes law: So that by such evil
and fantastical opinions, some has not been afraid in deed, to mary keep
two wyfes, The which opinions, the Kings majesty, as a most Christian
Prince, by thaduise aforesayed, not alowyng as Godly, and Christian, or
convenient to be spread abroad, or mainteyned in the realm: straightly charge
and commands, all Archebisshoppes and Bisshoppes, and other which has
spiritual iurisdiccions within the realm, to proceed against all such as
has, or hereafter shall mary, or keep, two wyfes at once, (whereof the first
is his lawful wife) or shall put away his wife, and mary another, and to
punish such offenders, according to the Ecclesiastical laws, with grave and
severe punishment, to fear therewith others, which, else wouldfall to such
insoent and unlawful acts.

And that all his highness officers, and loving subjects, who has charge or
zeal thereto, shall detecte all such offenders, to the said Archebisshoppes
and Bishops, and others that exercises spiritual iurisdiccion, and aid the
same, to the punishyng of such euiyl doers, according to the order or the
law, in those cases. And if so be, the said Archebisshoppes, Bisshoppes, or
other who has thexercise of spiritual iurisdiccions, be slack and negligent,
in the execucion of the said process, and punishyng of such evil doers, as
is before rehearsed: That then the justices of Peace, in every shite, or any
other his majesty's loving subjects, shall declare and signifye such
offenders and misdoers, to the kings highness counsel, by their letters,
that his highness by thaduise aforesaid, might se a convenient redress made, of
such misorder, and look more straightly upon tharchebishoppes and Bishops,
which does not execute their duties in this behalf, according to the trust
committed unto them.

God save the King.
