An humble DESIRED UNION BETWEEN PREROGATIVE And PRIVILEGE.

SHOWING, That if one draw too hard one way, and the other another, the whole
COMMONWEALTH must be in danger to be pulled in sunder.

The Serpent AMPHISBENA.

This double headed SERPENT is a Wonder,
It draws two ways, and tears the womb in sunder:
The woeful EMBLEM of a troubl^d STATE,
Where Civil WARS do threat to ruinate.
Imprinted at London by Richard Olion. 1642.

An humble DESIRED UNION BETWIXT PREROGATIVE and PRIVILEGE.
COncord or discord have bin, are, and will be either the raising or ruin of
Kingdoms, and Commonwealths. And as 2 heads are too many for one body, (as the
Picture of the African Serpent shows) eitheir to rule or to be ruled when the
wills and affections are violently extended to contrary attractions then such
distractions are the forerunners of destructions; And what true English
understanding heart does not moan, grieve and is filled with horror and
amazement to see know, and feel the Calamity of this sometimes flourishing
famous renowned Kingdom to see it transformed into an Acheldama, and so many of
our fertile fields and pastures turned into the horrid shapes of so many
Golgotha's, this land that has had so many innumerable undeservd blessings
from God, that it has long bin admired of, and esteemed the Eden, or Paradise
of the world, the support to all our foreign friends and the scourge and
terror of our Enemies, to be so suddenly changed and Metamorphosed, so rent
and torn with factions divisions and contentions that her peaceful bowels are
ripped up and her intrailes plow^d with the slaughtering swords of her own
unnatural and undutifull sons when Gods Commandments which were wont to be
the rule and guide of all our Actions are now slighted contemned and trampled
under foot, when too many do preach and teach the breach of both the first
and second table, and in stead of exhorting men to Peace and Unity, they
thunder and bluster War and bloodshed: But all the world may know that such
Pastors and Teachers were not sent by him whom they pretend and fainedly seem
to serve, for the Eternal Prince of Peace never gave any of his servants any
command or Commission to raise War, (especially Domestique, Civil uncivil
War, and surely those nimble talking tong-men that talk so hotly of
Battles, they would not willingly be at one themselves, and they do know
chat a whole skin is a good cover to sleep in.

The Weapons that Gods Ministers should use in their Warfare, was wont to be
prayers and tears only; all the persecuted and Martyred Protestants that
suffered in the bloody Reign of Queen Mary, had no other Arms to oppose
Authority; noe Imprisonment, Banishment, loss of goods, Fathers, Mothers,
Wives, Sons, Daughters, kindred or friends, could shake their loyalty; no Racks
Tortures, or Tyrannical Torments, nor Death in most cruel ways of flame,
fire and faggot, could alter the Allegiance of Protestants in those times, so
that there was not any one of them did attempt at any time to raise divisions
to disturb either the Queen or State; therefore if we be of the same ancient
Religion which they then professed, and has bin since maintained these 84 years
in this Kingdom, then we have more reason then they had to be obediently
thankful for it, because we do (or may) enjoy the blessings and benefits of it
in secure peace and tranquillity which they could not.

Love is the Livery which the servants of our Savior does wear, for he says,
By this shall all men know that you are my Disciples if ye have love one to
another, Joh. 13. 35. Now love and peace have no communion or fellowship with
War, especially in one and the same Kingdom, betwixt one and the same Nation,
pretending to profess one and the same Religion: nor do these men show
themselves to be Christ's Ministers or Disciples that stir up division betwixt
us, for every Kingdom divided against it self shall be brought to naught, and
every City or House divided against it self shall not stand: Matthew 12. 25.

In the Reign of King Richard the first, (surnamed Cor de Lion or Lions heart)
there was a Bishop in this Land that Rebelled against the King who was taken in
a Battle and clap't in Prison, the News of the Bishops imprisonment being
carried to Rome, the Pope ( Benedict the 2) sent a Letter to the King for the
Bishops enlargement, wherein he declared that the Bishop was a servant of God,
a Reverend Father, and likewise the Pope wrote that he was his Son: to which
Letter the King returned an answer to the Pope to this effect, May it please
your Holiness, If this be a Habit or Coat for a Churchman, and one of your
Sons, I pray you Judge, for I took him fighting in this Coat of complete
Armor: The King thus sending and the Pope seeing the Armor sent this reply,
May it please your Majesty, such a garment as this belongs to no Son of mine,
and therefore as he is in prison, there let him lie for me.

It were well if every man and woman were at deadly War with their
transgressions, such a War would make our peace with God, and the God of Peace
would give us the blessing of his peace, which passes all understanding.

How can peace be expected if we continue in our wickedness and wallow in
Impieties, esteeming peace at that low rate as if it were not worth the praying
for, or the desiring for without any command from Authority, some strange
opinioned men have thrust out of the Church that needful prayer, Give peace in
our time O lord; Almighty and most Merifull Father, is omitted and neglected,
the Creed is left out, and unbelief and Infidellity has intruded too much
into the room of it and the Commandments are not repeated, and in the place
of all these is crep't in a confused Mass of Toutalogicall Long-winded
Repetitions, with the fearful Instigations and Incitements to provocations of
Hostility and Mischief.

Mr. John Stow relates in his Chronicle, page 697, that in the 25 year of
Queen Elizabeth's blessed Reign, Anno 1583. on the 4 and 6 of June, one Elias
Thacker and one John Copizg were hanged at St Edmondsbury in Suffolk for
dispersing Libells and Pamplets against the Book of Common Prayer, which were
written by one John Brown one of the first mad Apostles of the Sect of the
Brownists.

There are no Protestants but will confess, that that Queen (of happy and
famous memory) was a true defendresse of the Faith professed by the
Protestants, that she hazarded her life for it diverse times, in the bloody
reign of her Sister and in the whole course of her 44 years Reign many
Romish Treasons were plotted and attempted against her only because she
maintained that Book, which was then no Masse-booke (though now it be esteemed
so) and if any Popery had bin then perceived to be in it, that glorious and
godly Princess would never have protected it, neither would two great
Protestant Kings (since her Reign) have professed and maintained it 40 years,
yet I am of opinion that somethings may be omitted in it some things reformed
some things dissolved, but the most correspondent to Scriptures manners and
good life, I hope shall be ever upheld and maintained by all understanding
Protestants.

Thus the vain scattering opinions of some selfewill'd, some ignorant, some
Ambitious, some Presumptuous, and some malicious, Turbulent spiriits have
drawn the Church and State several ways, that the poor Commonwealth (which
is the body of the Kingdom) is almost pulld in twain, as is Emblematically
showed in the Picture of the two headed Serpent.

There are too great a number that have gotten the wisdom of the old serpent
but there are few that are possessed with the Innocence of the Dove, the old
Serpent is a malicious breaker of Peace and a diligent Laborer for War, his
only business is to make us wicked and he knows that for the sins of a
people God sends War for a punishment, 1 Kings. 8, 35 37. He knows War does
plunge a Nation into misery and that the breach of all Gods laws is Attendant
upon War, and Inseparably join with it; Pride (like a Gentleman Usher) goes
before destruction odious swearing Impious Profanation, damnable disobedience,
execrable murders, shameless adulteries, Incests, Rapes, and deflorations,
Lawless Stealing and plundering and all the Crimes and Calamities that may
bring poor and miserable mankind to destruction are Incident to War, and
continual waiters on Mars and Bellona.

Yet there is nothing more uncertain then the events of War nor is there any
thing more unsure then the success of a battle for though it be never so
prudently pondered by the most wise and valiant counsel of the best and most
expert Leaders, though the plot be contrived by the best Judgments of the most
knowing Commanders, as how to gain the advantage of ground wind, sun, how the
Front, Van, Rear, Flanks, Wings, and body of an Army shall or may prevail and
be victorious; yet all these serious consultations have found most strange
alterations, and as a man that presumes to reckon without his Host is quite
out and must begin again, for. They are most blind, with ignorance besotted,
Who think Wars council in a Chamber plotted,
Must be so acted with the dint of sword,
As it was wisely talkd of at the board
Me thinks the Proverb should not be forgot,
The Wars are sweet, to those that knows them not.
But if there were any sweet content in War, it may rather be, so either in a
foreign War abroad against Turks, Infidels, Jesuitical Papists, or any
of Gods and our Nations Enemies such Wars as those may not only be Tolerable,
but Commendable, Profitable, and Honorable; But for Englishmen, for
Britains, for Protestants, to War against Protestants, the Fathers against
their Sons, and the Sons against their Fathers, when one Brother shall
sheath his sword in the Bowels of another, when a King is against his
Subjects; and Subjects against their Sovereign, this kind of War is
unpleasing to God, and a good King, unprofitable distasteful to true and Loyal
Subjects, and dishonorable to all.

God forbid that Prerogative of Kings should be too much stretched or
diminished any way, or that Privilege should shrink to enslave or pinch the
liberty of freeborn Subjects: Our King does know that if he defend the Faith
the Faith will save him: and he further knows that he must maintain his
Laws, or else his Laws cannot defend him: The King knows, that though Kings
are called Gods on earth yet they are but Gods of earth (or earthen Gods) and
loyal Subjects do obediently love and honor the King. Good Kings may be
compared to Lightning because as Lightning does never hurt Wool or any soft
unresistable substance, but it violently penetrates, breaks and melts Trees
Rocks, and Mettalls, so a good King does never proceed in wrath against mild
and gentle natures. I would we could think upon the great mischiefs that the
divisions betwixt Scilla and Marius brought to the Roman Empire, the massacres
that long continued in Italy between the Guelphes and Gibelines, or the
unnatural dissension that bloodily embrewd this Kingdom 80 and od years
betwixt the Royal Families of York and Lancaster, and as Brothers in one
House do often jarre and disagree, yet if one of them be injured by a stranger,
the other will take his part, so let all Englishmen or Britains, King and
Subjects, great or small (like Brothers) take it to heart how they are all
abused (by the common enemy) the Rebels in Ireland, and God grant that the
King may be defended from all false friends and fierce enemies, that we may all
be united in peace here, and jointly and unanimously relieve the opressed and
distressed calamities under which our poor Protestant Brethren have so long
suffered, and do still groan under in Ireland.

These shall be the daily prayers and humble desires of JOHN TAILOR.

FINIS.
