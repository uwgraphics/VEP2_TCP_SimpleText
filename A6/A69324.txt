A Proclamacion set forth by the kings majesty, with the assent and consent
of his most dear uncle Edward duke of Somerset, Governor of his royal
person, and of his realms, dominions and subjects protector, and others of
his highness preuy counsel, concerning the inhibicion of all preachers, as well
such as has been licenced, as also all other, the.xxiii. day of Septembre in
the second year of his Majesty's most gracious reign.
Whereas of late by reason of certain controuersious and sedicious preachers,
the kings Majesty moved of tender zeal and love, which he has to the quiet
of his subjects, by the advice of the Lord Protector and other his highness
counsel, has made Proclamacion, inhibited and commanded, that no manner of
person, except such as was licensed by his highness, the lord Protector, or
by the Archbishop of Cantorbury, should take upon him to preach in any open
audience, upon pain in the said proclamacion contained: And that upon hope
and esperaunce that those being chosen and elect men should preach and set
furthe only to the people such things as should be to gods honor and the
benefit of the kings majesty's subjects: Yet neuettheles his highness is
advertised that certeigne of the said preachers so licensed, not regardyng
such good admonicions, as has been by the said Lord Protector and the rest
of the counsayll on his majesty's behalf by letters or otherwise given unto
them, has abused the said authority of preaching, and behaved them self
irreuerently and without good order in the said preachynges, contrary to such
good Instructions and aduertisementes as was given unto them: whereby much
contencion and disordre might rise and ensue in this his Majesty's Realm:
Wherefore his hyghnes, myndyng to see very shortly one vnifornie order
throughout this his Realm, and to put an end of al controversies in Religion
so far as God shall give grace: for which cause at this time certain
bishops and notable learned men by his highness commandment are co^gregat:
has by the advice aforesaid thought good: Although certain and many of the
said prechers so before lice^sed have behaved them self very discreteli and
wisely and to the honor of God and his highness contentacion: yet at this
present and until such time, that the said order shall be setfurth generally
through out this his Majesty's realm, to inhibite, and by these presentz does
inhibit, generally, as well the said preachers so before licensed as all manner
of persons whosoever they be, to preach in open audience in the pulpit or
otherwise by any sought color or fraud to the disobeiyng of this
commandment: to the intent that the whole clergy in this mean space might
apply them self to prayer to almighty God for the better acheuyng of the same
most godly intent and purpose: Not doubtyng but that also all his loving
subjects in the mean time will occupy them self to Gods honor, with dew
prayer in the chruche, and pacient hearing of the Godly Homelies heretofore
fetfurth by his highness Iniunccions unto them, and so endenout them self that
they may be then most ready with thankful obedience to receive a most
quiet, godly, and uniform order to be had throughout all his said Realms and
dominions. And therefore has willed all his loving officers and ministers
as well justices of peace as Majors, Shiryfes, baylifes, Constables or any other
his officers, of what estate degree, or condition soever they be, to be
attendaunt upon this proclamacion and commandment, and to see the infringers
or breakers thereof to be imprisoned, and his highness, or the Lord Protectors
grace or his Majesty's Counsayl to be certefied thereof immediately: as they
tender his Majesty's pleasure and will answer to the contrary at their peril.

God save the King.
