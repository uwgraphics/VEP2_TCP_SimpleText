A DILIGENT SEARCH amongst Rulers, Priests, Professors, and People; and a
warning to all sorts high and low, that are out of the doctrine of Christ, and
fear not God. Put forth by Dorothy White living in Waymouth.
Woe unto him that offends one of these little ones that believes in me,
says Christ, it were better for him that he had a Millstone hanged about his
neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the Sea; it is better for that
man he had never been born.
UPon the 25th day of the second month, 59. as I was passing along the street,
I heard a cry in me; again on the 26th day of the same Month, the same cry was
in me; again on the 27th day, the same cry was in me, And as I was waiting
upon the Lord in silence, the word of the Lord came unto we, saying, write, and
again I say write, (As I have said it shall come to pass) and this was the
cry, I will confound, I will confound, the devices of this people, I will make
their devices to be of none Effect, I will cast out the council of their
Princes; O Earth, Earth, Earth hear the word of the Lord, and be warned before
the cup of indignation of the Lords fierce anger is poured out upon you.

And though you stir never so much against the Lord and against his anointed,
you do but kindle a fire, and at last you will fall into it your selves; Yea
you shall run into the Caves, and dens of the Earth to hide your selves from
the Lord, and from the glory of his Majesty, when he shall appear to shake
terribly the Earth, then shall your nakedness be laid open before you, then
shall you see What you have been working in this dark night that is over you, a
night of thick darkness has over clouded you.

O you blood-thirsty Rulers of England, you Rule by the powers of Darkness,
you have joined with the strength of Hell to ensnare the innocent, and to
destroy the Lamb of God; where he does rule, you crucify the Lord of Glory,
you are of Sodom and Egypt (spiritually so called) for in the streets of
spiritual Sodom and Egypt is our Lord slain, For the cry of blood is found
amongst you, and the cry of your sins is exceeding great, it has ascended to
the ears of the Lord God of heaven and Earth, And all the sacrifices that you
offer up to the Lord is but a corrupted thing, the Lord is wearyed with your
abominations.

Therefore a warning from the Lord God unto you, Priests, Rulers, people and
professors, while there is a call to repentance, for now has the Lord called
all to repentance, and has once more warned you whiles the day of mercy
lasts, for Sodom and Ghomorah of old were warned to repent of the Judgments
that should come upon them, and they repented not, and were destroyed. And you
has the Lord warned to repent, and once more has he warned you, before the
day of desolation come, wherein there will be no place for repentance found;
for now is the Lord God working his mighty work in the Earth, he is subduing
Kingdoms, and ruling the Nations as with a rod of Iron, he is bringing down
the mighty from their sears, he is throwing down Kings from their Thrones; And
all you high and loughty ones, you fruitless branches, you will the Lord cut
down with the sword of his power; and all you briers and brambles of the Earth
that are now fighting against the Lamb of God, you shall be as fuel prepared
for the fite in the day of the Lords fierce indignation, for a day of sorrow,
anguish and pain and great tribulation shall come upon all flesh, and upon all
that are out of Covenant with God, for great is the God of Abraham of Isack and
of Jacob, and who shall be able to withstand his power: For now is he come to
establish his Throne in righteousness, upon the top of all Thrones, yea, he
will sit as King upon his holy hill of Sion, for Jacobs God has appeared, and
his light now shines, and has broken through darkness, and has broken the
bonds of iniquity, and is arising with healing in his wings, on them that do
believe.

None knows the Father but the Son, and him to whom the Son reveals him,
and him that has the Son, has the Father also, And the Son is the light and
life of men, that all through him might believe, and have everlasting life. For
now is God appearing in power and in Majesty, and through his Son is he drawing
all men unto him, that would come in unto him, who is the light that
enlightneth every man that comes into the world, this is him, whom the
Prophets prophesied of, and the same which John bare witness to, and said that
he was not that light, but was sent to bear witness of that light. This is the
true light, and he does enlighten every man that comes into the world. The
same do we bear witness to now. The world was made by him, and the world knew
him not, he came to his own, and his own received him not, But to as many as
did, to them he gave power to become the sons of God.

Now to you that are seeking abroad, for that you have lost at home in your own
houses, (within you) you must turn in again to the light of Christ, the way to
the Father, and Covenant of God. All that are out of the light, are out of
Covenant with God, For he is given for a covenant of ^ight unto the Gentiles,
and for salvation to the ends of the Earth: This is my welbeloved Son, hear ye
him in all things, says God. This is the true Prprophet, and all that will not
hear this prophet, are to be cut off from the Earth. And all other prophets do
we deny, that do run and never were sent of God, these shall not profit the
people at all, they are the wolves, they have gotten the sheeps clothing but
inwardly they are ravening wolves by their fruits you may know them; These are
the deceivers of the Nation, upon these will the Lord God power out the cup of
his fierce indignation, for the fire of his jealousy is kindled against them,
and he will take vengeance on them, for they are murderers of the Son of God,
for the day of terrible judgment is drawn near unto them, a day of howling and
of bitter lamentation, a cup of vengeance will the Lord God power out upon
them; woe, woe, woe, from the Lord God unto them, they shall down into the
depth of Hell without speedy repentance; a warning from the Lord God unto you
Priests of England, hear, hear, and consider before the fiery wrath of the Lord
God fall upon you; fear, fear, and tremble for fear of the Lord God of Hosts,
for you has the Lord God a great and mighty controversy with, against you,
for now is the Lord coming, to try the sons of men, and to purify the sons of
Levi, and to purify them as fine gold that has been tried seven times in the
fire, And he is purifying of his temple that he may dwell therein, as he has
said, I will walk in them, I will dwell in them, I will be their God, and they
shall be my people, and it shall come to pass says the Lord, that I will
raise up the righteous branch of David, and a King shall rule and prosper, and
of his Dominion there shall be no end. And this is the name they shall call him
(the Lord our righteousness) For many shall come from the East, and from the
West, and shall sit down with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob, that are
the seed of Abraham borne after the spirit. In Isaac shall the seed be
blessed, That is, not the seed of Abraham that is born after the flesh, for
that is the persecuting birth, he that is born after the flesh, persecuteth him
that is born after the spirit, Cain was a murderer from the beginning, Cain
offered up sacrifice, yet he slew his brother Abel, the just one, born after
the spirit, but Caines sacrifice was not accepted with the Lord, but the blood
of righteous Abel cried from the Earth for vengeance to the Lord, although you
offer many sacrifices, yet does not the Lord regard them, you are of Cains
stock, you persecute the just one born after the spirit, you murder your
brother, but the blood of him cries from the Earth for vengeance to me says
the Lord, to be taken on you, Woe unto the drunkards of Ephraim, that are not
drunk with wine, nor strong bear, but with the blood of Saints, you must drink
the cup of wrath, you heap up wrath upon your selves, you heap up destruction
upon destruction, for the all seeing eye of God beholds you and your secret
intents, let them be never so secretly acted, he does see your ways, and he
will reward you openly, a just recompense according to your deeds of darkness,
for the powers of heaven shall move, and there shall be earthquakes in diverse
places, the powers of heaven does move, the Earth does tremble before the Lord,
the mountains melts at his presence, he does not shake the Earth only, but the
heavens also: Like as the lightning comes out of the East and shines into the
West, so shall the coming of the Son of man be; And we have seen his coming and
we are built upon the Rock, and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against us.
Although many are saying, there are a people risen up now that go about to
turn the world upside down, if we let them go on; But I tell you it is not the
people, but it is the power of God, for he is come to turn the World upside
down. That that, which has ruled, over may be brought down under, and that
which has been of low degree, may be raised up by the power of God, to rule
and have the dominion; for God is coming to throw down the kingdom of Anti
christ that has had the dominion, and has ruled in the hearts of men, the
prince of the powers of darkness, that rules in the hearts of the children of
disobedience that obey not the Gospel of Christ.

For kingdom shall rise against Kingdom, and nation shall rise against Nation,
for there shall be wars and rumors of wars on the Earth, and when you see those
things coming to pass, then is the end near, behold the time comes says the
Lord, that I will draw near unto judgment, I will be a swift witness against
the double minded, and all that are covered with an unrighteous covering; for
all coverings shall be too narrow, for Sion shall be ploughed as a field, the
follow-ground turned up, and the frutless branches burned, for now is the Lord
coming to require fruit of his vineyard, Behold I will tell you of my be
loved concerning his vineyard, my beloved has a vineyard upon a very fruitful
mountain, and he looked for fruit and it brought forth wild grapes, I will tell
you what I will do with my vineyard, I will take away the hedge about it, I
will also forbid the clouds of heaven that it should not rain. Now man in the
beginning was created in the Image of God, and he was the vineyard of God,
placed in a very fruitful mountain, as long as he stood there he was in union
with God, but when he went our into transgression, he lost the union with God,
then he brought forth the wild grapes, he became the degenerated plant,
degenerated from his maker, this is the state of fallen man, so long as he is
in transgression, let him profess what he will, yet he is naked and ashamed to
appear before the Lord, when the Lord calls to him to return, because he is
not covered with that righteous covering that he was in, in the beginning, but
he has sown to himself figgleaves to cover his nakedness, that is a
self-righteousness.

God that made Heaven and Earth, and created all things has looked down from
heaven, and is beholding the children of men, and is calling to them to return
from the evil of their ways, by his Son Christ the light and life of men, and
does enlighten every man that comes into the world, he is not come to destroy
life but to save life, but he is not come to destroy sin in the flesh; for this
very end and purpose, was the Son of God made manifest in the flesh, that he
might destroy the works of the devil, and by the light is his work manifested,
for whatsoever manifests, the same is light, and as it is received and
believed in, and followed, and obeyed; it will lead out of sin, and out of
transgression, and it will lead, unto the Father of lights, from whence it
came: as he said I came out from the Father, and I testify of the Father to
the world; Again I shall leave the world, and go to the Father; So all that
come unto him that is the light, he leads out of the world, and leads to
the Father again, for he was given for a leader to the people, and for a light
unto the Gentiles, and for salvation to the ends of the earth, unto the people
that sat in darkness has the light shined, and a glorious light has appeared
to them that sat in the shadow of death, and has given them the knowledge of
the Father, in the face of the Son, he has given us the knowledge of the glory
of God in the face of Jesus Christ, the light that John bear witness too, John
said he was not that light, but was sent to bear witness of that light, and
said, that was the true light, that lights every man that comes, into the
world, Yet John was a burning and a shining light, John was in prison when
Christ came, for hearing witness to the light, and for preaching repentance,
and for crying in the wilderness, prepare the way of the Lord, and make his
paths straight in the desert; for they that are not come to the light of Christ
within them, are yet in the wilderness: They have not heard the cry of John,
nor made straight the way of the Lord, nor regarded his cry that calls to
repentance, but he is kept in prison by them that deny the light, but now is
the light come, and does rule in the hearts of the children of light, and the
day has dawned, and the day star is risen in our hearts, that leads to the
Lamb of God, and the Lamb shall get the victory; and the Lamb shall have the
dominion, for he is come to rule in the earth, and all shall throw down their
Crowns at his feet, for now is God exalting him, over all the Kingdoms of the
world, and he shall sit in Majesty, and rule the Nations with the word of his
power; for now is the Gospel of peace to be preached unto all Nations, and
peoples, kindreds, and tongues, to all that dwell on the face of the whole
earth; for now has the trumpet of the Lord sounded, and an Alarm is gone
forth of his holy mountain to all that dwell on the earth, to worship him in
the spirit and in the truth, for such is the Lord calling to worship him, For
behold now is the day wherein the Lord will not be worshipped at Jerusalem, nor
in this mountain, nor at Samaria, but he will be worshipped in the spirit and
in the truth: for when the woman of Samaria was drawing water at the well of
Samaria, Christ said unto her, if thou had asked of me, I would have given
thee living water, that whosoever drinks thereof should never thirst again;
then she left her water-pot and went into the City, and said, behold a man that
told me all that ever I did: is not this the Christ? Then she left the water of
Samaria when the living water was come, and when she had tasted of the water of
life, she left Samaria, and worshipped there no longer.

Behold now is the Lord coming to make a separation between those that worship
him in the spirit and in truth, from them that worship him not in the spirit
and in the truth, for that is the false worship that is out of the truth, and
there the deceivers worship, the deceivers went out from the truth; they do
lead people into error, and deceive them for dishonest gain. O Israel, thy
leaders has deceived thee, they have corrupted thy footstepts before the Lord,
therefore is the Lord coming to scatter them with the whirlwind of his wrath,
They shall be as chaff that is to be burned with unquenchable fire, in the day
of the Lords fierce indignation.

Therefore a warning from the Lord unto you Rulers, Professors, and people in
the Town of Waymouth, a warning from the Lord God unto you that are out of the
light of the Son of God, that are yet in rebellion against the Son of God the
light of the world.

To you that are seeking the living among the dead, in vain do you seek there,
for the living God you do not serve, whiles you live in sin, and say you must
live in sin whiles you are upon earth, this is contrary to the doctrine of
Christ that the Apostles Preached, and said they were sent to turn people from
darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God; and they preached the
Gospel freely, as they had received freely, for they Preached the Gospel of
Christ to be the power of God, and they spoke as they were moved by the holy
Ghost, and from the Revelation of Christ in them; These be the true Ministers
of Christ, that Preach Christ revealed in them, they are sent of God, and this
is the difference between the Ministers of Christ, and if Antichrist, that run
and are not sent of God, they tell the people of a Christ that they must
believe in, that dyed for their sins, when they themselves do not believe in
him, nor know the light of Christ in them, he died to save his people from
their sins, not that they should live in their sins, and they that know him so
far, knows him to be their Savior, and they to be saved by him, and redeemed
from all iniquity; They can say their Redeemer lives in them, and they are
translated from death unto life, and set free by the Son; As many as are set
free by the Son, are free indeed, they are no more under the Law, but under
grace, The Law came by Moses, But grace and truth came by Jesus Christ; had it
not been for the law we bad not known sin; The law is light, and this is the
law of God written in our hearts, as he said, I will write my law in their
hearts, and will put my spirit in their inward parts, and they shall not depart
from me, I will give them a heart of flesh, I will take away their stony heart
and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.

Behold now is the Lord gathering in his chosen seed, chosen before the
foundation of the world, that shall serve him in truth, and in righteousness;
for righteousness shall flow down as a stream, and justice shall Rule in the
earth, and judgment shall be set up in the earth, that the inhabitants thereof
may learn righteousness, for judgment is he come who is the light, that those
that do not see, may see, and those that do see, may be made blind; and he is
come not to bring peace on the earth, but a sword, to cut down and destroy the
man of sin; and this is the work he is doing, to destroy sin in the flesh: In
them where sin yet remains, there Christ is not known to destroy the works of
the devil, for that end was he manifested in the flesh, for this is the mystery
of godliness, Christ manifested in the flesh, for he that reveals the Father
is the Son, and the Son is the light, and by him are the secrets of God
revealed to them that fear him; But them that are out of the light, they know
not the secrets of God, they are out of the fear of God: For he that believes,
out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water, springing up to eternal
life, the everlasting fountain shall be opened unto him, and the springs of
life unstopt, that all may come and drink freely: for Christ came not to call
the righteous, but sinners to repentance, and to unstop the ears of the deaf,
and to open the eyes of the blind, and to raise the dead to life; I am the
resurrection and the life said Christ, he that believes in me shall never see
death; and I will raise him up at the last day; But he that walks in darkness
and fayes he has fellowship with God, he is a liar and does not the truth, but
if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, then have we fellow-ship one
with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin.

This to you that are mocking at the light and scoffing at the spirit of the
Lord, a woeful day is coming upon you, a day of terrible vengeance upon all that
are found striving against the Lord, and resisting his spirit, a day of
desolation, and of swift destruction, a cup of endless wrath will the Lord
pour out upon you, unless you speedily repent; for the day of vengeance is
drawing near you, for God will not be mocked; for the Lord that created all
things upon the whole earth, at several times moved me to go into your steeple
horse, in the time of your worship, foreseeing the great misery and desolation
that is coming upon you, shown to me by the Lord; But before I could deliver
what the Lord sent me to deliver, they set hands on me, and put me forth, and
carried me to the prison, and told me they would put me in, but did not; It did
not lie in their power to do it; but when I came up again, the Lord led me in
again, and many strived against me, and put me out again before I had done
delivering the message of the Lord; Again the word of the Lord came unto me, Go
and say the Lord of hosts has sent thee to bear witness against the Idol
shepherds; But many strived against me, but woe from the Lord God unto them that
strive to hinder the messenger of the Lord: Again the word of the Lord came
unto me: Go cry against the foolish Prophets that Preaches lies in my name, by
the power of the Lord I was brought thither, to fulfill his will, and to
deliver his word faithfully, which word is like a fire, and like a hammer, that
breaks the rocks in pieces that cannot be staved: But two feirce spirited men
stirred up with much wrath came and haled me forth, and said it was the Devils
work, and that I looked like the Devil; but they are his servants that does his
work, and they fight for their master, as the high priests servants did of old:
But woe unto all them that are found fighting against their maker, woe from the
Lord God unto you, that have strived to hinder the messinger of the Lord, you
shall know in the day of the Lord, when he shall appear to take a count of your
actions in this thing then shall you know that I was sent of God; then shall the
light in your consciences be awakened and then shall you see what you have been
doing; And then shall you witness for me before the just judge of heaven, that
I was sent by him, and that I cleared my conscience to you, whether you will
hear it or no, it will stand a witness against you in the day of wrath, when
wrath shall be poured out without mercy upon the ungodly, and upon the
rebellious, and such as have rejected the council of the Lords for woe and
misery is coming upon such, that are yet rebelling against the Son of God, the
light of the world, a warning from the Lord God unto such, whilst the day of
repentance lasts, before the time come that repentance be hid from their eyes,
and that they go down to the grave in sorrow, and perish in the pit. For
judgment is begun at the house of God and it must go through all, and end in
the destruction of the wicked: For the wicked shall be turned into Hell, and
all that forget God: For upon the ungodly shall rain snares, fire and
brimstone, storms and tempest, this shall be their portion to drink, for the
righteous Lord loves righteousness, and his countenance will behold that
which is just; for God is in the congregation of the righteous, and they shall
abide with him for ever.

The servant of the Lord fore-writ of certain men were craftily crept into
houses, leading silly women captive, laden with sin, and with diverse lusts
having the form of godliness, but denying the power thereof, ever learning,
but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth: These are the men he
fore-writ of, that are craftily crept into houses, (and calls them churches)
but they are Wells without water, and clouds without rain carried about with a
tempest; And these are the deceivers that calls houses Churches, and these are
the silly women led by them captive (mark) captive into sin: Diverse lusts is
diverse sins, and they that are led in them, are led into captivity, (mark) they
are ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth, whilst
they are led into sin, they are ever learning, and never able to know the
truth, They have the form of godliness, but they want the power; and the power
is the truth, and the truth is the way and they that want the power are out of
the way (mark) and the way is the Son, and the Son sets free. And as many as
are led by the spirit of God, are the Sons of God, and them that the Son sets
free, are free indeed.

This is to be sent abroad amongst the inhabitants of Waymouth as a warning
from the Lord God unto them, before the day of desolation come; that is drawing
near to them (...) are out of the fear of God, and are yet gainsaying the tr^^^
for a just and lawful trial whereby they might come to the light of Christ
within them, and try their way, to see how it differs from the way of God and
to return from the evil of it, and return into the truth, and feel after God,
and find him.
