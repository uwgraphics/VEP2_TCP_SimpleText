THE ROTA
OR,
News from the Common-wealths-mens Club,
Written by Mr. Henry Stubb;
It Is better then a Syllybub.
1.
AT Westminster where we take Boat,
There on the left hand you may note
The sign of the Turks Hedd and Throat.
2.
What heads and throats therein there be,
If you will have patience to see,
These few lines here shall notify.
3.
Here Harrington breeds up his youth
To the discovery of no truth,
All Commonwealths-men in good sooth.
4.
A question here, though nere so rude,
Is so belabourd, and so tewd,
And into sundry pieces hewd.
5.
If unresolvd by I, or Not,
It must be put to the Ballot,
It Is Mr. Harringtons own plot.
6.
The finest thing that ere was seen,
The one side white, the other green,
And there you must put in a Bean.
7.
First Harrington does hawk and hum,
And tells a story of old Rome,
Which from his own store never come.
8.
He cites Sigonius and Lamtridius,
Authors which to the Club are hideous,
And he in quoting most perfideous.
9.
But there a sad mishap befell,
Which much does grieve me for to tell,
But I am glad it was so well.
10.
The learned man stood up and spoke,
That by two Losses he was broke,
His Reputation and his Cloak.
11.
Quoth he, My Reputation
I hear is tumbled up and down,
Much like a Football through the town.
12.
And for my Cloak, by this good light,
This Rascal Miles but yester-night
With Coffee did it all bedite.
13.
Next Polixfen, that Politician,
Yet surely he is no Hebrician,
And (as I take it) a worse Grecian.
14.
Whom (...) did so fright,
He was not himself again that night,
It Was thought he did his Chair beshite.
15.
There Is Poultney too, that man of Law,
In Politics he is but raw,
But prattles more then a Jack-daw.
16.
Who speaking once of injustice,
Made a distinction somewhat nice,
It was between a sin, and Vice.
17.
Next comes in Gold that brazen-face,
If blushing be a sign of grace,
The Youth is in a woeful case.
18.
Whilst he should give us Sol's and Ob's,
He brings us in some simple bobs,
and fathers them on Mr. Hobs.
19.
Nay, he has got the prettiest feat,
Monarchs out of the world to beat,
Thus proves thei're all a tacit Cheat.
20.
If man in state of nature be,
And one imparts his Right to me,
I cheat him of his property.
21.
The (...), if many men possessed,
To one give all their interest;
He must be deemed a Cheat at best.
22.
We want not an Attorney hight,
Lame Collins, (if I name him right)
Oh! it is a very learned Wight.
23.
The subtlest man that ere I saw,
Did Arguments from Scripture draw;
Religion was before the Law.
24.
If so Sir Harrington's mistane,
Religion does the Law sustain,
Law property, it is most plain.
25.
A Parson too, of no small note,
His sense as threadbare as his coat;
And neither of them worth a groat.
26.
The man does hope in time to be,
Chaplain to the Academy;
He Is fit, for he can scarce tell three.
27.
Morley, who thought to have been one
Of the Committee, but was none;
For had he, they would been all undone.
28.
'Twas well foreseen, for the wise Knot
Thought that the man migt have a plot,
For to have dipped their Beliot.
29.
One in a Speech he did rehearse,
Against the Popes-land, he was so fierce,
He cut it off at least a teirce.
30.
He said he would quote Authority,
That the full length of Italy,
Contained but threescore miles and three.
31:
A Cambrobritain here god-wot,
Must needs make one of this learnd kno^^
But twere as good that he were not.
32.
Taff Morgan, God her Worship save,
Does shit among them very grave,
He Is no great Statesman, but great K --
33.
Last, Skinner of his Chair grown proud,
Does gravely weild the busy crowd,
And still to Orders cries aloud.
34.
To tell you more of Mr. Skinner,
He Would rather talk, then eat his Dinner;
It Is that which makes him look the thinner.
35.
But whilst the man to Stafford cried,
Sir you to Orders must be tyd,
Or else you must not here abide.
36.
For our course here, is not to prate
Of things thee do too near relate
To the Affairs of present state.
37.
Speak to the question, it is sound,
In what of Government the Ground,
Or the Foundation may be found.
38.
Stafford with that did lowly bow,
Good Mr. Speaker calm your brow,
And of my Argument allow.
39.
For had your question any sense,
I should not take the confidence
To give your Worship ought offense.
40.
But since for nonsense it may pass,
To speak to you in Country-Phasse,
Your Worship is a learned Ass.
41.
Which words he took in so much scorn,
That nothing else would serve his turn,
But presently he must Adjourn.
42.
Adjourn, quoth Stafford, in a fright,
Are you a Burgess, or a Knight?
Sure I shall to the Tower to night.
43.
But lo, the worst of all disasters,
A Youth stood up, My learned Mosters,
All Governments are much like plasters.
44:
Plasters, quoth Stafford, let me die;
If not, this poor Academy,
Have not some grand infirmity.
45.
And since it happens to be so,
I may chance be infected too;
Therefore my Masters all, adieu.
Exit.
