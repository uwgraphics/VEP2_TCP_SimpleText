His Majesty's MOST GRACIOUS SPEECH To both HOUSES of PARLIAMENT.
My Lords and Gentlemen,
I Came to Pass the Bill for Disbanding the Army as soon as I Understood it was
Ready for Me.

Though in Our present Circumstances there appears great Hazard in Breaking such
a Number of the Troops, And though I might think My Self unkindly Used, that
those Guards who came over with Me to your Assistance, and have constantly
Attended Me in all the Actions wherein I have been Engaged, should be Removed
from Me, yet it is My fixed Opinion, that nothing can be so Fatal to Us, as that
any Distrust or Jealousy should arise between Me and My People; which I must
own would have been very unexpected after what I have Undertaken, Ventured and
Acted for the Restoring and Securing of their Liberties.

I have thus plainly told you the only Reason which has induced Me to Pass this
Bill, and now I think My Self Obliged in Discharge of the Trust Reposed in Me,
and for My own Justification, that no Ill Consequences may lie at my Door, to
tell you as plainly My Judgment, that the Nation is left too much Exposed.

It is therefore Incumbent on you, to take this Matter into your Serious
Consideration, and Effectually to Provide such a Strength, as is Necessary for
the Safety of the Kingdom, and the Preservation of the Peace which God has
given Us.

FINIS.
