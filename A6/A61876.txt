A DISSWASIVE FROM Conformity to the World.

AS ALSO GOD'S Severity AGAINST Impenitent SINNERS.

WITH A Farewell SERMON Lately Preached to a Congregation in London.

By HENRY STUBS Minister of the Gospel.

Psalm 141. 5. Let the righteous smite me, it shall be a kindness; and let him
retrove me, it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head; for
yet my prayer also shall be in their calamity. London, Printed and are to be
sold by John Hancock senior and junior, at the Sign of the Three Bibles in
Pope's Head Alley, 1675.

TO THE Professors OF THIS AGE.
DO you not know that you ought to be followers of God, and Christ, and the
Saints, Ephesians. 5. 1. Matthew. 16. 24. Heb. 6. 12. and not the multitude, Exodus
23. 2. not the world, Romans 12. 2. And dare you yet to set up them to be your
patterns, and to follow their examples, who are not at all esteemed in the
Church? I speak it to your shame, Is there not a Holy Christ to be your
Pattern, and a Holy Word to be your Rule; but Professors of Religion must needs
be as the irreligious of the world, taking example from them, who will take no
example from Christ? Now therefore there is utterly a fault amongst you,
because you conform so much to this world, contrary to that express
prohibition, Romans 12. 2. Be not conformed to this world; and because you have
so much fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness; contrary to that
word, Ephesians. 5. 11. Why are ye not rather Reprovers of the world, and condemners
of it, as Noah was, Heb. 11. 7. By your walking as Christ walked, 1 John 2. 6.
and according to Rule? Gal. 6. 16. Why do you not rather suffer your selves to
be derided and despised? Know you not that the world you conform to lies in
wickedness? 1 John 5. 19. And that the unrighteous world shall not inherit the
Kingdom of God? 1 Cor. 6. 9. you know it. And you know also that Eyes are upon
you, observers you have many, God, Angels, and Men; you had need look well to
your ways: you have a Rule to talk and walk by. It Is not for you to say, we
will be as the Heathen, Ezekiel. 20. 32. we will be as others, contrary to Ephesians. 4.
17. Which forbids you to walk as others, in the vanity of your minds: Remember
the words of Christ to his Disciples, Luke 22. 26. ye shall not be so: You must
walk as Christ walked He has left you an example, 1 Pet. 2. 21. If you shall
walk as others, you will by so doing give great occasion to the enemies of God
to Blaspheme, 2 Samuel 12. 14. And be stumbling blocks to the world: and if
offenses come by you unto the world, woe unto you, Matthew. 18. 7. Remember
David, and what God told him, The child that is born to thee shall surely dye;
verily the name of God is blasphemed among the profane through you; Romans 2.
24. You should adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things; mark In all
things, Tit. 2. 10. and be very tender of the name of God and his doctrine,
that it be not blasphemed through you, 1 Timothy 6. (...). If it be, be sure God
will be as good as his word, Amos 3. 2. You only have I known, therefore I will
punish you Christ has somewhat against you already, because you have left your
first love. Remember therefore from whence you are fallen, and repent, and do
your first works, or else I will come unto you quickly, and will remove your
candlestick out of its place, except you repent, Rev. 2. 4, 5. Would I could
say of you as it follows, verse. 6. with a little alteration, But this you have,
that you hate conformity to the world which Christ also hates. Brethren, be ye
followers of Christ, and mark them which walk so, as that ye have Christ for an
ensample. For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even
weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ: Whose end is
destruction, whose God is their back and belly, whose glory is in their shame,
who mind earthly things, Phil. 3. 17, 18, 19. But let your conversation be in
Heaven, as was Paul's and the Saints at Phillippi, Phil. 3. 20. Seek you the
things which are above, where Christ sits at the right hand of God. Set your
affections on things above, and not on things on the earth; for you profess
your selves to be dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. When Christ,
who is your life, shall appear, then shall you appear with him in Glory.
Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; Col. 3. 2, 3, 4, 5. I
beseech you by the mercies of God, the meekness of Christ, and by your
appearing before his judgment seat; hear counsel and receive instruction, that
you may be wise at length, Prove. 19. 20. If you will not hear counsel and
receive instruction, read Jer. 6. 8. and consider and tremble. That you may is
the prayer of one who wishes above all things that your souls may prosper, and
be adorned as your bodies do and are.

NONCONFORMITY TO THIS WORLD.
Romans 12. 2. And be not conformed to this world.
IN this and the foregoing verse we have an exhortation to holiness, branched
out into three particulars.

1. That we present our bodies, a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God.

2. And not be conformed to this world.

3. But to be transformed by the renewing of our mind.

I beseech you: though I might be bold in Christ to enjoin you, yet for love
sake, I rather beseech you, pray and entreat you.

Therefore, seeing you have received so much mercy from God through Christ.

Brethren, being all the Children of God through faith in Christ. Gal. 3. 26.

By the mercies of God, bestowed on you. Gods mercy is one, but the effects and
fruits of it are many; Election, Redemption, Justification.

That you present your Bodies; not your Souls only, but your Bodies also: God
will have the Body conformed to his will, and not to the world, as well as the
Soul; for the Body is for the Lord, for the service of the Lord, and the Lord
for the Body, 1 Cor. 6. 13. Our Bodies being his, and bought with a price, 1
Cor. 16. 19, 20. Our Bodies being the members of Christ, 1 Cor. 6. 15. and
therefore also must we glorify God with our Bodies, 1 Cor. 6. 20.

The Apostle praying for the Thessalonians, prays that their Bodies, as well
as their Souls, might be sanctified, 1 These. 5. 23. I note this the rather,
because many think they may do what they will with, and make what use they will
of their Bodies; but they are greatly deceived, for the Body is not for
Fornication, 1 Cor. 6. 15. no not for Ostentation, to make a show with it.
Read, Romans 6. 13, 19.

That you present them; 1. That you offer and consecrate them to God as a
Sacrifice of thankfulness; as Heb. 13. 35.

A living sacrifice, dead indeed unto sin, but alive to God, Romans 6. 11. being
quickened by his spirit, that we might not live to our selves, but to him who
died for us, 2 Cor. 5. 15.

Holy, not regarding, but hating iniquity in our hearts; for if iniquity be
regarded, we cannot be accepted: Psalm 66. 18.

Acceptable to God, well pleasing to him through Jesus Christ, 1 Pet. 2. 5.
through faith in him, without which we cannot please God, Heb. 11. 6.

Which is your reasonable service. 1. Your service of God, which consists not
in the offering up of unreasonable Beasts, as heretofore, but in the offering
up of your reasonable selves. Or, Your service, which is agreeable to the Rules
of true Reason.

And be not conformed: 1. Take not upon you the form or fashion of this wicked
world, make not the Manners and Pleasures of worldly men your rule to walk by.

But be ye transformed, changed, altered. 1. More and more.

By the renewing of your mind, understanding, will and affections.

That ye may prove.

1. Discern, understand.

2. Approve.

3. Give proof by a Godly life that you do understand and approve.

That good, acceptable and perfect will of God.

1. Good, which teaches, and leads to that which is good, and makes good.

2. Acceptable, nothing being acceptable to God but what is according to his
will.

3. Perfect, comprehending all things necessary to salvation, 2 Timothy 3. 16.

These words, And be not conformed to this world, are a Dehortation: Wherein,

1. The Persons Dehorting, Paul a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an
Apostle, one that well understood the mind of his Lord and Master, and would
give nothing in charge but what he had received, 1 Cor. 11. 23.

2. The Persons Dehorted, The believing Romans, beloved of God, called to be
Saints, Romans 1. 7. Yea, eminent Saints, Romans 1. 18. Such as had obeyed from the
heart, Romans 6. 17.

3. The thing they are Dehorted from, viz. Conformity to this world, which you,
who are Saints, and called to the Kingdom and Glory of God, should look upon
with contempt, and trample under foot.

4. The Mode of the Dehortation, it is in a beseeching way; I beseech you.

5. The Motive; By the mercies of God. Doct. It Is the will of the most holy
God, that they who are called to be Saints should not conform to sinners. They
that are called out of the world must not be conformed to this world.



I shall show you,

1. What is meant by the World.

2. What meant by conformed.

3. What of the World must not be conformed unto.

4. That it is so.

5. Why.

6. The Use.

First, What is meant by the World? By the world understand The Men of the
world, Psalm. 17. 14. Worldly minded Men and Women, who have their hearts,
inheritance, and happiness here, their portion in this life. The wicked of the
world, Joh. 14. 17.

These are called the World,

1. Because they are ruled by the God of this world, 2 Cor. 4. 4. Ephesians. 2. 2.

2. Because they have received only the spirit of the world, that spirit which
teaches worldly things, and places its happiness in worldly things, 1 Cor. 2.
12.

3. Because they are satisfied and contented with the things of this world,
Psalm. 4. 6. and 17. 14. Phil. 3. 19.

4. Because they are the major part of world.

Secondly, What meant by Conformed?

By conforming to the world understand, fashioning our selves according to it;
resembling the world, and being like to it; making the men of the world our
Pattern, our Example, and Copy to write after.

When we approve, imitate and follow the sinful fashions and practices of this
world, then we conform to it.

Now, not to be Conformed to this world, is not to approve, not to imitate, not
to follow the sinful, vain, foolish fashions and practices of this world.

Not to put on their form and shape in our behavior.

Thirdly, What of the world it is wherein we must not be conformed unto it.

1. Not in that wickedness the world lies in, 1 John 5. 19.

Not in that unrighteousness it is filled with: a Catalogue whereof is set
down, Romans 1. 29, 30, 31.

Not in those works of darkness it delights in, Romans 13. 12, 13.

Not in those works of the flesh, set down Gal. 5. 19, 20, 21.

Not in the walk of the Gentiles, Ephesians. 4. 17, 18, 19. 1 Pet. 4. 3.

Not in its lustings, 1 John 2. 16.

We must not be conformed (...) in its sinful Customs, Dispositions, Practices.

We must not be conformed to the practice of worldly men, in Natural, Civil,
and Religious actions.

We must not eat and drink as they do, for they feed themselves without fear;
Jude 12.

We must not buy and sell as they do, for therein they walk not by that rule
Mat. 7. 12.

We must not carry our selves in Religious matters as they do.

We must not hear as they do, for they hear without preparation before hearing,
Attention at hearing. Affection at hearing. Application at hearing.
Practice after hearing. See Ezekiel. 33. 31.

We must not pray as they do: For

1. They make light of Prayer, Job 21. 15.

2. They Pray with the lip only, and not with the heart, Isa. 29. 13. Mat. 15.
18.

3. They continue not in Prayer, they grow weary.

4. They think to be heard for their much speaking, Matthew. 6. 7.

5. They turn away their ear from heari^ (...) whom they Pray, Prove. 28. 9.

6. They aim amiss in Prayer, Jam. 4. 3.

We must not come to the Lords Table as they do, for they come unpreparedly.

Nor observe Sabbaths as they do, for they trifle them away.

Nor sing Psalms as they do, for they sing not with the heart, but voice only.

Nor fast as they do, for they abstain only from food, not from sin.

Fourthly, That it is so, That Saints must not conform to sinners.

Thou shall not follow a multitude to do evil, Exodus 23. 2.

After the doing of the Land of Egypt and Canaan shall ye not do, neither shall
ye walk in their ordinances: Levit. 18. 3.

Thou shall not learn to do after the abominations of the Nations: Deuteronomy. 18. 9.

Walk not in the way of sinners, refrain thy foot from their path: Prove. 1. 15.

Enter not into the path of the wicked, go not in the way of evil men: Avoid
it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away: Prove. 4. 14, 15.

If sinners entice thee, consent thou not: Prove. 1. 10.

Thus says the Lord, Learn not the way of the Heathen: Jer. 10. 2.

Though Israel play the Harlot, yet let not Judah offend: Hos. 4. 15.

This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as
other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind: Ephesians. 4. 17.

Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove
them: Ephesians. 5. 11.

Ye are children of the light, and of the day; not of the night, nor of
darkness: Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be
sober: 1 These. 5. 5, 6.

The Kings of the Gentiles do so and so^ But ye shall not be so: Luke 22. 25,
26.

St. Peter speaks of some Converts that would not run with the world in their
sinful fashions and courses, though they were wondered at and evil spoken of
therefore; 1 Pet. 4 4.

Fifthly, Why. 1. From the World. 2. From themselves. 3. From Christ. 4. From
the things themselves wherein conformity to the world is practiced.


First, From this World.

1. Because Satan is the God and Prince of it, 2 Cor. 4. 4. Joh. 12. 31. and
14. 13. and 16. 11.

2. Because it is an evil world, Gal. 1. 4. and lies in wickedness, 1 John 5.
19. See its description, Psalm. 36. 1, to 5. and Romans 3. 11, etc. and 8. 7.
Ephesians. 4. 18, 19.

3. Because this evil world must give account, even for those things wherein we
are so prone to follow it, 1 Pet. 4. 5.

4. Because the end of it is destruction, Phil. 3. 19. You would not suffer
with it, and will you sin with it?

Secondly, From themselves, who by profession are Saints, Christians.

1. Because they are not of the world, but are called out of it; Joh. 15. 19.

God has separated you from others to be his own peculiar; Levit. 20. 24.
Exodus 19. 5.

Hence, for this cause, as well as others, 'twas that God was displeased with
his people of old, for desiring a King, that they might be like the Nations, 1 Samuel 8. 5. viz. Because God has severed them from other people that they
should be his: Levit. 20. 26.

2. Because they have better Principles, then the world has, viz.

1 Timothy 1. 5.
A pure Heart, Good Conscience, Faith unfeigned,
They have Christ in them, as a principle of their life, Gal. 2. 20. And the
spirit of God, 1 John 4. 4. 1 Cor. 2. 12.

The Principles of the world are,

An impure Heart,

A bad Conscience,

Real unbelief.

Yea Satan, Ephesians. 2. 2. 1 Pet. (...) 4. and the spirit of the world, 1 Cor. 2.
12.

Now is not this a good reason why the people of God should not conform to this
world? for should they of better principles conform to them of worse? should
they that have a pure Heart, good Conscience, and Faith unfeigned, conform to
those that have an impure Heart, a bad Conscience, and real Unbelief? Should
they who have Christ and the Spirit of God in them, conform to them who have
Satan and the Spirit of the world in them?

3. Because they have better patterns to conform to, then the world is, viz.

1. God, 1 Pet. 1. 15, 16.

2. Christ, Col. 2. 6. 1 John 2. 6.

3. Saints, Heb. 6. 12. Phil. 3. 17.

Mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample: So as ye have the
servants of Christ, not the world for your example.

4. Angels and glorified Saints. We must study so to do the will of God on
Earth, as it is done in Heaven: Matthew. 6. 10.

Now, judge in your own Consciences, should they who have such excellent
patterns, conform to the pattern of a base world?

4. Because they are bound by their Baptism to the contrary, viz. To renounce
the world, the pomps and vanities thereof, and not to follow, or to be led by
it. Now should we do that which is a breach of our Baptismal Covenant.

5. Because you that are Saints are born to great matters, even to an
inheritance incorruptible and undefiled, etc. 1 Pet. 1. 3, 4. and should you,
persons that are new born to so great an estate, should you please your selves
in a conformity to the poor things of this world?

6. Because you are grown up to maturity, to years of discretion; so that it is
time for you to put away childish things: Whilst you were Children 'twas more
tolerable, but now that you are grown up to be men, to be so childish and
foolish is intolerable. See 1 Cor. 13. 11.

7. Because you are more excellent then your neighbor, Prove. 12. 26. and
therefore must not conform to them. For shall the more noble conform to the
more ignoble? Ye are Gods treasure, Psalm. 135. 4. And shall Gods treasure
conform to the refuse of this world? You are Priests of God, 1 Pet. 2. 9. And
shall the Priests of God conform to common people? The Priests of old were not
to touch any unclean thing.

8. Because you have not so learned Christ, Ephesians. 4. 20. q. d. The Doctrine of
Christ in which you are instructed, and which you have learned, requires
another manner of life from you, then that which the Gentiles lead, therefore
you should not imitate them. Christ has taught you otherwise, The grace of God
which brings salvation, teaches you to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts,
and to live Righteously, soberly, and godly in this present world; and not to
conform to its unrighteous, intemperate and ungodly life, Tit. 2. 11.

9. Because you are now within sight of home, your Fathers house; and your
salvation is nearer, and therefore must cast off the works of darkness, and
walk honestly as in the day, not in rioting, drunkenness, not in chambering and
wantonness, not in strife and envying: As the world does. Romans 13. 11, 12. Your
thoughts should now be so taken up and pleased with what you have in view, the
great things which are to come, and so near to come, that all the toys and
trifles this world is so much pleased with, should be looked upon by you with
disdain.

10. Because you shall now very speedily be separated from this world, and
distinguished from it, and delivered from that wrath which they shall suffer
for ever and for ever; and will you conform to them now, in those things for
which they shall suffer the vengeance of eternal fire? would you have your
souls gathered hereafter with those you conform to here, and whose fashions you
have learned here? David would not, Psalm. 26. 9.

Thirdly, From Christ.

1. Because Christ designedly gave himself to deliver us from this present evil
world according to the will of God and our Father, Gal. 1. 4. To what he gave
himself, see Isa. 50. 6. and 52. 14. His back to smiters, his checks to them
that plucked off the hair, his face to shame and spitting. Consider this you
proud men and women, whose Backs, Faces, Heads, Necks, Breasts, and Arms, show
the pride of your Hearts. Did Christ give himself to suffer all this, that he
might separate and deliver you from conformity to this world? And is not this a
good Reason why you should not conform unto it, in hair, habit, and nakedness.

2. Because Christ and his Kingdom is not of this world. 1. Christ is not of
it, Joh. 8. 23. 2. His Kingdom is not of it, Joh. 18. 36. Not only in respect
of the subjects, but in opposition to worldly Kingdoms, which come with
external pomp and observation. But Christ's Kingdom is not so, Luke 17. 20, 21.

Fourthly, From the things themselves wherein conformity to the world is
practiced.

1. Because these things are not of the Father, but of the Devil, and the
world, 1 John 2. 16.

2. Because the love of these will not consist with the love of God, 1 John 2.
15.

3. Because these things pass away, 1 Cor. 7. 31. 1 John 2. 17.

Sixthly, The Use.

1. Of Information. Then the best are prone to conformity to this world, so far
as they are carnal; what need else of this Prohibition, Be not conformed to
this world. Even Joseph was found guilty of conformity to Pharaohs Courtiers in
swearing by the life of Pharaoh, Genesis 42. 15, 16.

2. Use of Reproof, Of such as profess themselves to be Saints, and to be
called to fellowship with Christ, and yet have fellowship with the unfruitful
works of darkness; who profess themselves to be called out of the world, and
yet conform unto it; who profess themselves to be Saints, and yet live like
sinners. God finds fault with this, and is much displeased that his people
should learn the works of the Heathen, Psalm. 106. 35. And think you it does not
displease him that we should learn the fashions of the world, and serve their
Idols, Psalm. 106. 36. Do not they whose fashions you learn, make Idols of their
Hair, Skin, and Habit? and will you serve their Idols? Pray God they prove not
a snare unto you. Read, 1 King. 14. 24. 2 King. 17. 33. 2 Chronicles. 13. 9. and 25.
14, 15.

May we not well say to such as conform to this world, as Jehu the Prophet said
to Jehosaphat, 2 Chronicles. 19. 2. should you conform to the ungodly, and love and
like the practices of them that hate the Lord! Pray God wrath may not come upon
you for this. Hezekiah a good man was proud of his fine things, 2 Chronicles. 32.
25, 26. with 2 King. 20. 13. but wrath came upon him for it. Read, Ezekiel. 23. 26.

3. Use of Examination. Do not we conform to this world? even we who in some
things are Non-conformists?

Do not many, who in some things separate from the world, in other things
conform unto it?

Do not many that separate from their worship, conform to their works?

Have not many fellowship with the world in the unfruitful works of darkness,
that will have no fellowship with them in worship?

The world is for rioting, drunkenness, chambering and wantonness, strife and
envying, Romans 13. 13. Would Professors were not so too?

The world is for lasciviousness, lusts, excess of Wine, revellings,
banquetings, 1 Pet. 4. 3. Would Professors were not so too?

All that is in the world, is the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and
the pride of life, 1 John 2. 16. Now I beseech you let us deal truly with our
selves, do not we conform to this world in these? In lusting after Pleasure,
Profit, and Preferment; are not* these in too great account with us? Do not we
love, desire, and seek after these? Would you that are Professors could wash
your hands from voluptuousness, covetousness, pride and vain glory.

Take a view of the world, and then take a view of your selves, and then judge
whether you do not conform unto it.

The world is,

Atheistical, without God in the world, Psalm. 14. 1. Ephesians. 2. 12. Are not we so
too, or very near it? See Isa. 49. 14. and 51. 13. Psalm. 77. 9.

Blasphemous, Psalm. 74. 18. And are not we guilty of this too much? See Romans 2.
24.

Covetous, 2 Pet. 2. 14. And are not Professors so too? Judas a Professor, and
Demas a Professor were so; 2 Timothy 4. 10.

Defrauding, Romans 1. 29. And do not Professors the same? See 1 Cor. 6. 8.

Envious, Gal. 5. 21. And are not Professors so too? See 1 Cor. 3. 3.

Fearful of suffering for religion; of these read, Rev. 21. 8. And are not
Professors so too? See Matthew. 13. 21. Even Peter was too fearful.

God-distrusting, Psalm. 20. 7. Jer. 17. 5. And are not Professors so too? See
Isa. 31. 1.

Haughty, Romans 1. 30. And are not Professors so too? See 2 Timothy 3* 2, with 5.
Did not the Disciples of Christ affect superiority?

Idle, Sloathful, Ezekiel. 16. 49. And are not Professors so too? 2 These. 3. 11. 1 Timothy 3. 13. Matthew. 25. 26.

Kain-like, Brother hating; 1 John 3. 13. Prove. 29. 27. Joh. 15. 18, 19. And
are not Professors so too? See Jude 11.

Lukewarm, Indifferent, 1 King. 18. 21. And are not Professors so too? See
Rev. 3. 16.

Murmuring, 2 King. 6. 33. Rev. 16. 10, 11. Isa. 8. 31. And are not Professors
so too? See 1 Cor. 10. 10.

Negligent, neglects duty to God and man. 1. To God, Psalm. 14. 4. 2. To man,
Ezekiel. 16. 5. And are not Professors so too?

Offence-giving, Matthew. 18. 7. Do not Professors do so too? They did in Paul's
time, Romans 14.

Passionate, froward, ^retful; as Nabal, 1 Samuel 25. 17. Are not Professors so
too? See Jonah 4. 9.

Quarrelsom, Contentious; Are not Professors so too? See 1 Cor. 1. 11. and 6. 7.

Revengeful; Are not Professors so too? See Luke 9. 54.

Secure, like Laish, Judge. 18. 7. Are not Professors so too? See Jer. 8. 6, 7.
Hos. 7. 9.

Treacherous; Are not Professors so too? Mic. 7. 4, 5.

Uncharitable; Mat. 25. 42, 43. Are not Professors so too? See Jam. 2. 15, 16.
Job. 3. 17

Wavering, unbelieving; Joh. 5. 38. and 10. 26. Joh. 12. 39, 47. And are not
Professors so too? See Joh. 6. 60, 64, 66. Yea, see Luke 24. 25. Joh. 20. 25.

4. Use of Dehortation. Be not conformed to this world.

That I may the better dissuade you from conformity to this world, I shall show
you,

1. What they are called to whom you are beseeched not to conform.

2. What those things are called wherein you are desired not to conform.

3. What you your selves are called, who are dissuaded from conformity to this
world.

4. How God is affected and carries toward this world which you are beseeched
not to conform to.

5. How the world is affected and carries toward you who are dissuaded from
this conformity.

First, What they are called, to whom you are beseeched not to conform.

They are called,

1. Men of this world, Psalm. 17. 14 whose portion is in this life.

every day; whom he resists, etc. Will you conform to those toward whom he
thus carries himself? God forbid.

Fifthly, How the world carries, and is affected toward you who are dissuaded
from this conformity.

1. They hate and abhor you, Joh. 15. 19. Prove. 29. 27. according to that
ancient sentence, Genesis 3. 15.

ways? Will you conform to these in the Devils ways? God forbid.

O sirs let them return to you, but do not you return to them, Ier. 15. 19.

Three sorts make up this evil World:

The Voluptuous. Covetous. Proud.

Be not conformed to either,

1. I beseech you by the mercies of God be not conformed to the voluptuous of
this world.

There are that,

Attire, Adorn, dress and habit themselves to draw the Eyes of others to behold
them, after the example of Tamar, Genesis 38. 14. who put off her widows garment,
and put on something the better to allure her Father in Law. See Prove. 6. 10.

But I beseech you who make profession of Religion, by the mercies of God, be
not conformed to such.

There are that,

Burn in lust one toward another, men with men, working that which is unseemly,
Romans 1. 27. abusing themselves with mankind, 1 Cor. 6. 9. These shall not
inherit the Kingdom of God.

Wherefore I beseech you by the mercies of God, be not conformed to these.

There are that,

Cast their Eyes on beautiful objects, after the example of Joseph's Mistress,
Genesis 39. 7.

But I beseech you by the mercies of God be not conformed to such.

Feed not your Eyes with such objects.

Give not your eyes leave to look, for that may prove very dangerous. As it is
said in another case, Remember Lots wise; So I say in this, Remember David,
what his looking on a beautiful woman cost him, 2 Samuel 11. 2. with Psalm. 51.
And Sampson, ^udg. 14. 1, 2. and 16. 1. what his looks cost him: Yea and our
Grandmother Eve, what l^oking on the forbidden fruit cost her, Genesis 3. 6. Pray
therefore as David, Psalm. 119. 37. Turn away mine ^yes from b^holding vanity.
And do as Job, chap. 31. 1. Make a covenant with your eyes.

There are that,

Drink waters out of their own Cesterns, as they are allowed, Prove. 5. 15. but
they Drink immoderately, and unseasonably out of their own, 1 Cor. 7. 5. and
only to please themselves, not that they may be the fitter to serve God
thereby.

But I beseech you by the mercies of God be not conformed to these.

There are that,

Eat and drink too much; too much for their Health, Estates, Reason, Work, and
Employment. For their Health, impairing that thereby, Prove. 23. 29. For their
Estates, wasting them thereby, Prove. 23. 20, 21. For their Reason, weakening
that thereby. For their Work and Employment, hindering that thereby. These must
look for woe and sorrow, Read Prove. 23. 29. to end, and 1 Cor. 6. 9.

Wherefore I beseech you that make profession, by the mercies of God, be not
conformed to such.

There are that,

Frequent Stage-plaies.

There are that,

Gaze on wanton Pictures, which provokes to lust. See Ezekiel. 23. 14, to 18.

Hearken to wanton Songs and Ballats.

Idle out their time. This was Sodoms sin, Ezekiel. 16. 49. And David's too, when
Joab was besieging Rabba, 2 Samuel 11. 12. and an occasion of his uncleanness.
Other evils of it see, Prove. 19. 15. Eccles. 10. 18.

Wherefore I beseech you be not conformed to these.

Keep company with suspected persons, contrary to the charge, Prove. 5. 8, 9,
10, 11. Remove thy way far from her, and come not near the door of her house.

But I beseech you that make profession be not conformed to these; but do as
Joseph, Genesis 39. 10. who would not be with his Mistress.

There are that,

Love Pleasures more then God, 2 Timothy 3. 4. such shall be poor, Prove. 21. 12.

Wherefore be not conformed to these.

But seeing some Pleasures and Recreations are lawful, wherein does the world
offend in and about them?

Answer, They offend in and about them in respect of the Matter, Time, and End
of them.

First, In respect of the Matter. The world makes that the matter of Sport and
Recreation, which should be the matter of Devotion and Humiliation.

1. That which should be the matter of Devotion, as Scripture, Lots.

First, Scripture phraze and story. This is a taking of Gods name i^ vain,
which God will not suffer to go unpunished, Exodus 20. To have the Scripture is
a rich mercy, Psalm. 147. 19, 20. Romans 3. 1, 2. and 9. 4.

Wherefore I beseech you by this mercy of God, be not conformed to the world in
sporting your selves with Scripture.

Secondly, Lots. A lot is a Religious ordinance of God, because it is an
ap^ealing to Divine providence, what ever the matter be about which it is
conversant, Prove. 16. 33. And therefore that distinction of* Lots into
Religious, Civil, and Indifferent, will not salve the business, as some Divines
think; All lots being Religious as they are an appealing to Divine providence.

Quest. If the Question should be asked whither Card-playing, and Dice-playing
be a sin?

Answ. I answer, That as Carding and Dicing are commonly used, it is sin; and I
think I have good ground so to answer; for as it is commonly used, it is a
swerving from Scripture rules. To Instance in some known Rules.

First, Whatsoever is not of faith is sin, Romans 14. 23. Now will any say that
Carding and Dicing as commonly used is done in faith, with assurance that it is
pleasing to God in Christ.

Secondly, Whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord
Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him, Col. 3. 17. Now who can say
that Carding and Dicing as commonly used is thus done.

Thirdly, Whether ye eat or drink, or whatsoever else ye do, do all to the
glory of God, 1 Cor. 10. 31. Now do you think in your Consciences that Carding
and Dicing, as commonly used, is done to the glory of God?

Fourthly, In every thing, by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let
your requests be made known to God, Phil. 4. 6. Now is it thus used, and if
not, is it according to the rule?

Fifthly, Give no offense to Jew or Gentile, or the Church of God, 1 Cor. 10.
32. Is no offense given by it?

Sixthly, Whatsoever is of Good report think of and do, Phil. 4. 8. Is Carding
and Dicing of good report?

Seventhly, Abstain from all appearance of e^il, 1 These. 5. 22. Sure Carding
and Dicing has the appearance of evil.

Eighthly, Avoid all occasions of sin, Prove. 23. 21. and 4. 14, 15. and 58.
Doubtless it is the occasion of much sin.

Ninthly, Thou shall not covet any thing that is thy neighbors, Exodus 20. 17.
Now as commonly used, sure there is covering in it.

Tenthly, Thou shall not go beyond or defraud thy Brother in any matter, 1
These. 4. 6. As it is commonly used, it is a breach of this Rule also.

Secondly, That which should be the matter of Humiliation, the world makes
matter of Sport and Recreation, viz. Sin, and the Judgments of God.

First, Sin: As,

1. Men's living without a calling, to make sport.

2. Men's wearing women's apparel.

3. Men's playing the fool and acting to make sport, as if they had no
understanding. Thus to do is sin, and sin is matter of sorrow and humiliation;
and to take pleasure in that which is matter of sorrow, must needs be sin.

Secondly, The Judgments of God: As,

1. Foolishness and madness, 1 Samuel 21. 14, 15.

2. The enmity between the creatures caused by man's sin. Now to take pleasure
in these, is to take pleasure in those things which are matter of sorrow and
humiliation.

Now I beseech you that are professors, by the mercies of God, be not you
conformed to the world in these things.

Thus you see the world offends in and about Pleasures and Recreations, in
respect of the Matter.

2. The world offends in and about them in respect of Time, too much being
spent in and about them, viz. whole days and nights, contrary to Ephesians. 5. 16.

3. In respect of the End, Gods glory not being aimed at, as it should be in
every thing, 1 Cor. 10. 31.

There are that,

Mince as they go, Isa. 3. 16. so as to be taken notice of, and to take carnal
affections: See Matthew. 14. 6.

But I beseech you that profess Religion be not conformed to such.

Neigh after others Wives, Jer. 5. 8. and 13. 27. This is abomination, Ezekiel 22.
11. And such persons God will judge Heb. 13. 4.

Wherefore I beseech you be not conformed to such.

Open their feet to them that passes by, Ezekiel 16. 25. yea their Breasts, which
is more tempting.

This King James called opening the shop windows, as if they had a mind to sell.

But be not conformed to such.

Powder, Patch, and Paint; after the example of Jezabel, 2 King. 9. 30. and
those Ier. 4. 30. Ezekiel. 23. 40. But God threatens ^o send stench instead of
sweet smell, Isa. 3. 24.

Therefore be not conformed to such.

Practice or are present at Dancings, condemned, Job 21. 11, 12. Isa. 3. 16.
Matthew. 14. 6.

Be not conformed to such.

There are that,

Quit all shame and modesty, like those, Ier. 3. 3.

But I beseech you Professors, by the mercies of God, be not conformed to them.

Read ill Books, Play-books, etc. words and, matters which corrupt good
manners, 1 Cor. 15. 33. and is not convenient, Ephesians. 5. 4.

See the Rule^ Ephesians. 4. 29. And be not conformed (...) (...)h.

Seek mixed Wine, Prove. 23. 30.

Tarry long at the Wine, Prove. 23. 30. But I beseech you be not conformed to
these.

Use their Christian liberty for occasion to the flesh, Gal. 4. 13. That take
occasion from the doctrine of Christian liberty, to become licentious; using
their liberty as a cloak of naughtiness, 1 Pet. 2. 16.

But be not conformed to such.

Wander or walk too much in Fields or Streets, after the example of Dina, Genesis
34. 2. and the strange woman, Prove. 7. 12.

But I beseech you Professors, by the mercies of God, be not conformed to such.

Let such as have temptations to Incontinence, or unclean practices, consider
these Scriptures.

Prove. 2. 18, 19. and 5. 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, to 14. and 6. 26, 32, 33. and 7. 21. to
the end. and 22. 14. and 23. 27. and 29. 3. Eccles. 7. 26. 1 Cor. 5. 9. and 6.
9, 10. Rev. 21. 8. and 22. 15.

No whoremonger, nor unclean person has any inheritance in the Kingdom of
Christ and of God, Ephesians. 5. 5.

Wherefore let no man deceive you with vain words; for because of these things
comes the wrath of God upon the ^^^ldren of disobedience, Ephesians. 5. 6.

Diswasives from sensual pleasures.

1. They war against the soul, 1 Pet. 2. 11.

2. They hinder the knowledge of the truth, 2 Timothy 3. 6, 7.

3. They eat out all pleasure in and love of God, 2 Timothy 3. 4.

4. They choke the seed of the word, Luke 8. 14.

5. They keep from coming to the great Supper, Luke 14. 20.

6. They take away the heart from all that is good, Hos. 4. 11.

7. They are but for a season, Heb. 11. 25.

Esau's broth, ended in the loss of his birthright.

Judas his sop, in the Devils entering into him.

Babilons golden cup, in her downfall.

9. They are madness and folly, Eccles. 1. 17. and 2. 2.

10. The love of them speaks the power of godliness wanting, 2 Timothy 3. 5.

Wherefore I again beseech you, be not conformed to this world in the loving of
sensual pleasures.

I wish you such a sight as Moses had of the heavenly recompense, and then I am
sure you would love them no more then he did, Heb. 11. 25, 26.

Secondly, Conform not to the Covetous world.

You read of Covetous practices, 2 Pet. 21. 14.

I beseech you, by the mercies of God, be not conformed to the world in them.

This Dehortation to you that make profession of Religion, is not without need;
For,

1. Professors have been deeply guilty of covetousness; as Ezekiels hearers,
Ezekiel. 33. 31, 32. The Scribes and Pharisees who fasted often, prayed long, and
gave much alms, Matthew. 23. 14: Judas.

2. Christ warns his own Disciples against it, Luke 12. 15. and 21. 34.

3. Saint John writes to those that were Fathers in Christ's School, to take
heed of it, 1 John 2. 15.

And have you not need to be dehorted from it? Sure you have.

I shall therefore in a beseeching way apply my self unto you.

There are some that,

1. Abound in wealth, have abundance of all good things, and want nothing, and
yet have not power to eat thereof, Eccles. 6. 1, 2. But are cruel to
themselves, denying themselves meat, drink, apparel, rest and sleep; and cruel
to their families, denying them things convenient.

These sure are a part of the covetous world; And I beseech you by the mercies
of God, be not conformed to them.

part of the verse. and Jam. 5. 4.

But I beseech you, etc. be not conformed to these.

3. Cumber themselves about the many things of the world, so that they cannot
spare time for the service of God in the closet or family, Luke 10. 41.

These also are part of this covetous world; And I beseech you by the mercies
of God be not conformed to them.

4. Devise covetous things and practices, Isa. 32. 7. 2 Pet. 2. 14.

But I beseech, etc. be not conformed to these.

It Is like Zacheus was guilty of it, for says he, Luke 19. 8. If, etc.

6. Whose Eyes and Heart are not but for their covetousness, and for oppression
and violence to do it, watching opportunities; as when men are in distress and
necessity, they work upon men's necessities, to get what bargains they please,
Jer. 22. 17.

But I beseech you, etc. be not conformed to those.

7. Forget to do good, and communicate; though charged not to forget it, Heb.
13. 16. or if they do any thing this way, it is sparingly, grudgingly; contrary
to the charge, 2 Cor. 9, 6, 7. Too like him, 1 Samuel 25. 10, 11, 36. Forsake the
poor, Job 20. 19.

But I beseech you, etc. be not conformed to these.

Do any forget to sow their Land, at Seed time?

8. Some are Given to covetousness, Jer. 6. 13. Greedy of gain, Prove. 1. 19. 1 Timothy 3. 3. Are immoderate in their desires after riches, thirsting like the
horsleech; Ever crying give, give, Prove. 30. 15.

And in their Joy and Grief also.

In their Joy, in the enjoying of them, as He, Luke 12. 19.

In their Grief, in parting with them, as that young man, Matthew. 19. 21, 22.

But I beseech you, etc. be not conformed to these.

9. Hard men, reaping where they have not sown, and gathering where they have
not strawed; Matthew. 25. 24.

But I beseech you, etc. be not conformable to these.

10. Join house to house, Isa. 5. 8.

11. Keep bad company to get gain, Prove. 1. 14, 15, 16. contrary to the counsel
of the Holy Ghost: here and Prove. 4. 14, 15.

Some plead they shall have no Trade unless they do so.

But I beseech you, etc. be not conformable to these.

12. Lade themselves with thick clay or mire, burden, pollute, and entangle
themselves, in taking, raking, and ransaking for riches, Habak. 2. 6. Some lade
their Carts so much, that they either stick, or break all.

But I beseech you, etc. be not you conformed.

13. Make Gold their hope, Job 31. 24. Their strong City, Prove. 10. 15.
Trusting in their abundance, Psalm 52. 7. Contrary to the charge, 1 Timothy 6. 17.
and to their ruin, Prove. 11. 28.

Therefore I beseech you, etc.

14. Mind earthly things, Phil. 3. 19. Heavenly things are not in all their
thoughts.

But I beseech you, etc. be not conformable, etc.

there is no end of his labor, nor is his eye satisfied with riches, Eccles. 4.
8.

this is prohibited, 1 These. 4. 6.

required for a pious, charitable or righteous use, though there be enough for

But I, etc. be not conformable, etc.

18. Are Querulous, complainers, Jud. 16. never content with their condition,
with what they have; contrary to the charge given us, Heb. 13. 5.

But I beseech you, etc. be not conformable, etc.

19. Run greedily after the error of Baalam, for reward, Jud. 11. Adulterating
or corrupting the doctrine of Truth for filthy lucre; unlike to Paul, 2 Cor. 2.
17.

But I, etc. be not conformable, etc.

20. Speak mostly of the world, 1 John 4. 5. And of the earth, Joh. 3. 31.
whose language is, who will show us any good, Psalm. 4. 6. Who will show us how
we may get goods and riches?

But I beseech, etc. be not conformable, etc.

Disswasives from Pride.

First, Its not alone, it has very bad companions: As,

1. Naughtiness of heart, 1 Samuel 17. 28. 2. A froward mouth; Prove. 8. 13. 3.
Idleness, Ezekiel. 16. 49. 4. Unmercifulness, Ezekiel. 16. 49. 5. Contention, Prove.
13. 10. 6. Hardened mind, Dan. 5. 20. 7. An evil eye, Mark 7. 22. 8. Blasphemy,
Mark 7. 22.
More, see Prove. 6. 17, etc.

Secondly, God knows them afar off, has no respect for them, will have no
communion with them, Psalm. 138. 6.

Thirdly, God hates and abominates pride, Prove. 6. 16, 17. and 16. 5.

Fourthly, The proud err from Gods commandments, and are cursed, Psalm. 119. 21.

Fifthly, God resists them, Jam. 4. 6. 1 Pet. 5. 5.

Gods resistance supposes man's assault, and did ever any harden themselves
against God and prosper? Job 9. 4.

What, will you strive with your Maker? Woe to such, Isa. 45. 9.

Sirs, Sirs, see Ezekiel. 22. 14.

God will do to them that which he asks Job whither he could do, Job 40. 11, 12.

God is able to abase them, Dan. 4. 37.

And will be above them, Exodus 18. 17.

See also, Isa. 2. 11, to 18.

Beloved, would I could fright you from this cursed pride!

What shall I say to you?

It turned,

Angels into Devils.

Sodom into Ashes.

Pharaoh into the Deep.

Haman off the Gallows.

Nebuchadnezar a grazing with Beasts.

Achitophel out of the World.

Because Pride of Hair and Habit abounds, I shall close this Discourse with
some Disswasives from it.

1. Are not our clothes Memorials of our sin and shame?

Before our first Parents had sinned, they were both naked and were not
ashamed, Genesis 2. 25. But when they had sinned, they were ashamed, and sewed
fig leaves together to cover their nakedness, Genesis 3. 7. But God made them
coats of skins, ver. 21.

2. Are they not all Borrowed things? and that from poor despicable Creatures,
your servants? As,

Woollen from the Sheep.

Linen from the Earth.

Cotton from the Trees.

Silks and Velvets from the Worms.

Hats from Beavers and other poor Creatures.

Hair from I know not whom.

Now suppose a man to have many Servants, and he borrows a Hat of one, a Coat
or Cloak of another, and Shoes and Stockins of another, etc. and then goes
strutting up and down the Streets in these borrowed things, what would you
think of him?

3. Are not your Clothes, for the materials of them, much baser then
yourselves? And will you be proud of what is inferior to your selves?

4. What are your Bodies which you thus dress up and adorn? Are they not vile,
loathsome, stinking, foul, diseased bodies, which must dye and turn to
corruption?

5. Do Clothes commend you to God, or to wise and sober men? Nay, only to men
of vain minds they commend you.

6. Does not dressing, decking and adorning of our selves in such a way as is
usual, discover the vanity of our own minds?

7. Are not such dressings, etc. Temptations, snares, enticements and occasions
of sin to others?

8. Is not much of our Clothing waste and lost, and so a slighting of Christ's
counsel, Joh. 6. 12. If the Disciples of Christ had indignation at the pouring
of Ointment on the Head of Christ; and if they said, To what purpose is this
waste? Matthew. 26. 8. How much more may Christ say, when he looks on the Heads,
Necks, and Backs, and Feet of many Professors; To what purpose is this waste?
Might not the money given for these things have been saved and given to the
poor? Matthew. 26. 9.

9. Do not many poor want that which you put on for Pride?

10. What will you do in the day when God shall come to deal with you, and
reckon with you about your layings out upon your Pride? and Conscience shall
witness against you: So much laid out upon my proud lust.

For strange and needless apparel twenty pound, but for naked poor not twenty
shillings.

For costly new fashioned lace, as one says, ten pound, but for food for the
hungry not ten shillings.

For dressings and trimmings three, four, or five pounds, but for sick poor not
five shillings.

For toys and fancies twenty shillings, but for the relief of the needy not
twenty pence.

For hair I know not what, but for a pious or charitable use not any thing
considerable.

To take you off from Conformity to this world, give me leave to expostulate
with you. I shall do it for memory sake Alphabetically: Alluding to Gods
expostulating with them, Isa. 58. 5, 6.

Is this, This conformity to the world,

Is this,

To Abstain from fleshly lusts, which, etc. Or is this your abstaining, etc. as
you are earnestly beseeched, 1 Pet. 2. 11, 12.

To Abstain from all appearance of evil; as we are charged, 1 These. 5. 22.

Or is this your abstaining from, etc.

And so your abstaining, etc. in all the following expostulations.

1. To Bring the body in subjection, as Paul's practice was, 1 Cor. 9. 27.

2. To bring forth fruits meet for repentance, as we must if we will escape the
wrath to come, Matthew. 3. 7, 8. And those from 2 Cor. 7. 11. Is this to have
indignation against our selves, to be zealous, to take revenge upon our selves?
what work would indignation, zeal, and revenge, make upon your Heads, Faces,
Necks, and Backs, if you had these.

3. To be blameless as the Sons of God without rebuke, etc. Phil. 2. 15.

2. To Crucify the flesh with the affections and lusts, as they that are
Christ's have, Gal. 5. 24.

3. Is this to Condemn the world, as Noah did, Heb. 11. 7. Nay is it not to
commend the world, and say you do well to be Proud, Covetous, Wanton, etc.

Is this to be converted, and become as little Children? What to strive for
state, to seek for pre-eminence over one another; to be greatest, highest,
bravest, finest? A little Child does not so. Even the Disciples of Christ were
too worldly, minding worldly greatness and pre-eminence; which moved them to
put the question, Matthew. 18. 1. Who is to be greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven?

1. The Church; they dreamed of a worldly pompous state of it; for Mar. 9. 34.
they had disputed among themselves which should be greatest. See Act. 1. 6.
Matthew. 20. 21, 24. And Christ's answer, ver. 25, to 29. Now is this Conformity
to the world, to be turned from Pride, etc. Without which, Christ says, we
shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, Matthew. 18. 1, 2, 3, 4.

4. Is this to be consumed with zeal, because Gods words are forgotten, Psalm.
119. 139.

Is this to deny our selves; as they who will be Christ's Disciples must do,
Matthew 16. 24.

Is this to Enter in at the straight gate, and to strive so to do as we are
counseled by Christ, Luke 13. 24.

To be Examples as we are bound to be, specially Ministers, 1 Timothy 6. 11. and
4. 12. 1 Pet. 5. 3.

To Escape the corruption that i^ i^ the world through lust, 2 Pet. 1. 4.

Is this to Follow Christ our pattern, w(...) has left us an example that we
should f^^low his steps, 1 Pet. 2. 21. See Matt(...) 16. 24. 1 John 2. 6.

Is this to learn of Christ? Matthew. 11. 29.

Is this to be as God is in this world? 1 John 4. 17.

To Glorify God with our bodies? as we are bound by the price paid for us, 1
Cor. 6. 20.

Is this to Humble our selves under Gods mighty hand? as we are directed by God
himself in order to our exaltation, 1 Pet. 5. 6.

Is this to Judge our selves? as we must if we will not be judged and condemned
with the world, 1 Cor. 11. 31, 32.

Is this to Keep our selves from our iniquity? as we must do if we will approve
our selves upright, Psalm. 18. 23.

Is this to Lay to heart the afflictions of Joseph? who many of them are
clothed with rags: See Amos 6. 4, 5, 6.

Is this to Mourn for the sins of the time, as those that are marked out for
deliverance in a common calamity, do? See Ezekiel. 9. 4.

Is this, Not to lift up our souls to vanity? as they that will ascend into
Gods holy hill, and stand in his holy place, must not: Psalm. 24. 3, 4.

Is this to Note those that obey not the Gospel, and to have no company with
them, that they may be ashamed? 2 These. 3. 14. Nay is it not to harden them in
their sinful ways and fashions?

Is this to Order our steps in Gods word, as David prayed he might? Psalm. 119.
133. And so to Order our conversations aright as they must do who will see the
salvation of God, Psalm. 50. 23.

Is this to Put off the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful
lusts? Ephesians. 4. 22.

And to Put on the new man, which after God, is created in Righteousness and
true holiness? Ephesians. 4. 24.

Is this to Put off your ornaments from you, that God may know what to do unto
you? Exodus 33. 5.

Is this to Present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God; as
you are by the mercies of God beseeched to do? Romans 12. 1.

Is this your Quenching the fiery darts of Satan? Ephesians. 6.

Now Sirs, as St. Paul tells the Corinthians, concerning their manner of
communicating, This is not to eat the Lords Supper, 1 Cor. 11. 20.

So let me tell you concerning your conformity to this world,

This is not to Abstain from, etc.

This is not to Bring your Bodies in subjection.

This is not to be Converted.

This, etc. in all the rest of the Letters.

And as he says, verse. 22, 23. What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in
this? I praise you not. For I have received of the Lord that which I have
delivered unto you.

That you who are called out of this world, which is the Devils Chapel, into
the Church, which is the house of the living God; should not be conformed to
this world.

But should Abstain from, etc.

Bring your Bodies into subjection, etc.

Is this your reproving your unfruitful works of darkness? as you are required,
Ephesians. 5. 11. Levit. 19. 17.

Redeeming of time, to spend so many hours in making provision for the flesh?

Time is to be Redeemed, not trifled away, Ephesians. 5. 16.

Is this your Striving against sin, as your duty is to do? Heb. 12. 4.

Your Shining as lights, etc. Phil. 2. 15.

To be Transformed by the renewing of your minds? Romans 12. 2. No, for it is set
in opposition to being conformed to this world.

Is this your Using the world as not abusing it? 1 Cor. 7. 31.

Is this your Walking worthy of your high, holy, and Heavenly calling? as you
are required, Ephesians. 4. 1.

Winning others by your conversation? 1 Pet. 3. 1, 2, 4, 5.

Working out your salvation with fear and trembling? Phil. 2. 12.

Being without offense? etc. Phil. 1. 10.

Nay, Is not this your conformity to the world; Is not this,

1. To justify the worl^? Ezekiel. 16. 51, 52.

2. Is not this to be a comfort to the wicked world? Ezekiel. 16. 54.

3. Is this not to harden them in their sinful course? Their pride, etc.

4. Is not this to have fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness?
forbidden, E^hes. 5. 11.

5. Is not this to take the members of Christ, and to make them the members of
a harlot? 1 Cor. 6. 16.

6. Is not this to learn the works of the Heathen, and to serve their Idols,
Psalm. 106. 35, 36. which may prove a snare.

7. Is not this to give offense, contrary to 1 Cor. 10. 32. And to be an
occasion of stumbling, which Gods people should not be, 1 John 2. 10.

8. Is not this to call men on Earth, our Father, Master? See Matthew. 23. 9.

Helps against conformity to this world.

First, Understand well wherein you are not to conform to this world.

Sure not in any thing which is a swerving from the Rule, the written word of
God.

Not in any thing which is a transgression of a known Law.

Take some instances of known Rules.

1. Abstain from all appearances of evil, 1 These. 5. 22. This is one Rule.

Now in any thing that is or has the appearance of evil, we must not conform to
the world.

2. Avoid all occasions of evil of sin, to our selves or others. All Snares,
Traps and Temptati(...)s to our selves or others to sin; Prove. 23. 31 and 4.
14, 15. and 5. 8.

Now in any thing which is an occasion of sin to our selves or others, we must
not conform to the world.

3. Give no offense, etc. 1 Cor. 10. 32. Phil. 1. 10. 1 John 2. 10.

4. Those things think upon and do which are of good report, Phil. 4. 8. and
this you must have a care of lest you fall into reproach, and the snare of the
Devil; 1 Timothy 3 7.

Now those things which are not of good report, we must not conform to the
world in.

5. Do all in the name of Christ, Col. 4. 17. giving thanks, etc.

Now if the world do any thing which cannot be said to be done in the name of
Christ, therein you are not to conform to the world.

6. Follow others as they follow Christ, 1 Cor. 11. 1.

Now in those things wherein the world does not follow Christ, we are not to
conform to them.

5. Whatsoever you would that men should do to you, do you the same to them,
Matthew. 7. 12.

Now if the world do those things to others which they would not have done to
themselves, therein we must not conform to them.

8. Let all things be done for edifying, 1 Cor. 14. 26. In Knowledge, Faith,
Love, and holy Obedience.

Now if the world do any thing that tends to building up of others in
Unholiness, and Disobedience, Pride and Wantonness; we must not conform to the
world therein, for all must be done to edifying.

9. Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory, Phil. 2. 3.

Now if the world do, etc.

10. Look not every man on his own, but on the things of others, Phil. 2. 4.

Now if the world be all for it self, with the neglect of others, we must not
therein conform to the world.

11. Redeem the time because the days are evil, Ephesians. 5. 16.

Now if the world trifle away time, on Lords days and other days, we must not
therein conform to the world.

12. Whether ye eat or drink, or whatsoever else ye do, do all to the glory of
God, 1 Cor. 10. 31.

Now if the world do that which can have no tendency to the glory of God, we
must not conform to the world therein.

Secondly, Be convinced that it is a sin to be conformed to this world in such
matters before mentioned; Gods prohibition makes it a sin, Romans 12. 2.

When a man is sure a thing is sinful, he will resist it the more easily; but
if he be in doubt whether it be sin or no, he will the more easily venture upon
it, to commit it.

The Devils business is to make men believe that sin is not sin, that they may
commit it.

For this end he raises up one Prophet or another, to say as to Ahab, Go up
and prosper; or to say, There is no hurt in this; or to dispute for it, or
practice it himself, and then the Devil has gotten ground.

For when a thing is come to be a Controversy, and some that are Wise and
Learned, Holy and Religious, are on one side, and some of another; Then the
Hypocrite, as one says, has a cloak for his sin, and a Dose of Opium for his
Conscience.

Thirdly, Get the fear of the Lord, this will restrain from sin, Neh. 5. 15.

Fourthly, Make a covenant with your eyes, Gaze not on the fashions of others;
See Ezekiel. 23. 16.

Fifthly, Set upon the work of mortification, look upon it as a duty of
absolute necessity, Col. 3. 5. Romans 8. 13.

Sixthly, Get to be crucified to the world; and for this end make use of the
Cross of Christ, Gal. 6. 14.

Seventhly, Have your conversations in Heaven, and your affections on things
above, Phil. 3. Col. 3. Mind things not seen.

Eighthly, Set God always before you, Psalm. 16 8. Genesis 17. 1.

Ninthly, Think much of death and judgment, and what thoughts you will then
have of conformity to this world.

And now in Conclusion let me again beseech you, Be not conformed to this world.

I beseech you by the mercies of God, be not conformed to, etc.

And by me God himself beseeches you, 2 Cor. 5. 20.

Now suppose a Mother should beseech her Child,

By the Womb that bare him.

By the Paps that gave him suck.

By the Knees that dandled him.

And by all her care of and kindness to him: what would you think of him, if he
should not in a lawful thing yield unto her? would you not think him to be of a
flinty heart?

In like manner when God by his Ministers shall beseech you by the multitude of
his tender mercies; whereby,

1. He begat you to a lively hope of an Inheritance incorruptible, etc. 1 Pet.
1. 3, 4.

2. He has quickened us together with Christ, and raised us up together, and
made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus, Ephesians. 2. 4, 5, 6.

3. He has pardoned us, Psalm. 78. 38.

4. He has called us, 2 Timothy 1. 9.

5. Justified us, Romans 3.

6. Adopted us, 1 John 3.

7. He has renewed and saved us, Tit. 3. 5.

What stony hearts have they that will not yield when God thus beseeches by his
mercies bestowed on them?

Hear me you Professors, let me expostulate.

1. Why Sirs shall God loose and miss of the main end of bestowing his mercies
on you?

Our obedience is the main end of his bestowing mercies on us. See Psalm. 130.
4. Luke 1. 73, 74. Psalm 105. 39. to end.

2. Is it not to you that God applies himself in this beseeching way, even to
you who have received mercy to be begotten again, quickened, pardoned, called,
renewed and saved?

It Is to you he comes and beseeches by all his mercies, be not conformed to this
world.

Others that have not received these mercies, he cannot beseech by them.

3. Had others received the mercies you have, and being beseeched by them,
would they not, think you, be persuaded?

4. Will you hazard and endanger your selves by conforming to, and keeping
company with the men of this world?

Jehosaphat did so, 1 Chronicles. 19. 1, 2. and wrath was upon him therefore.

Josiah did so, 2 King. 23. 29. His forwardness to pleasure the King of Assiria
cost him his life.

The Israelites conformed to Egypt in Idolatry, Exodus 32. 1, 2, 3. And Gods
wrath waxes hot against them, v. 10.

And to the Moabites in Adultery, Numb. 25. 1, 2. and the anger of the Lord was
kindled against them.

If you live after the manner of wicked men, you are like to be judged after
their manner, Ezekiel. 23. 4, 5.

If the Assirian or others will persecute after the manner of Egypt, they shall
be punished after the manner of Egypt, Isa. 10. 24, 26.

5. Does not God find fault with doing after the manner of others? See 2 King.
17. 33. 2 Chronicles. 13. 9.

6. Is not that which is highly esteemed among men, abominable in the sight of
God? Luke 16. 15.

That course of life which is most contrary to the fashions of the world, is
most commendable and acceptable to God.

The further we go from the world in our speech, gesture, attire, works, and
actions, the nearer we come to true Godliness, Jam. 1. 27.

GODS severity against MAN for Iniquity.
Ezekiel. 24. 13, 14. In thy filthiness is lewdness: because I have purged thee,
and thou wast not purged, thou shall not be purged from thy filthiness any
more, till I have caused my fury to rest upon thee. I the Lord have spoken it,
etc.
Has he said it, and shall he not do it? Has he spoken, and shall he not make
it good? Numb. 23. 19.

Did he not make it good against the Jews, his own peculiar people? 2 King. 25.
begin. Jer. 39. 1, etc. Jer. 52. 4,

And if God spared not them, the natural branches, Romans 11. 21. will he spare
us? Take heed England, Take heed London, lest he also spare not thee: If God
have brought evil upon the City, which was called by his name, should ye be
utterly unpunished? ye shall not be unpunished: See Jer. 25. 29.

If they whose judgment was not to drink of the cup, who might rather have
expected favor, then you. If these have assuredly drunk, are you those that
shall go altogether unpunished? you shall not go unpunished, but shall surely
drink: See Jer. 49. 12.

Nay if God spared not the Angels, nor a whole world, will he spare us, 2 Pet.
2. 4.

I would hope, that God will not make a full end of us, but will correct us in
measure, yet sure he will not leave us wholly unpunished, Jer. 46. 28. But if
there be lewdness in our filthiness, and we will not be purged, God will cause
his fury not only to creep, but to rest upon us as it has done upon others.

In these two verses (not to speak of the context, for time will not give
leave) we have a heavy judgment threatened, with the cause and certainty of it.

1. The judgment threatened, Thou shall not be purged, etc. Till, etc.

2. The cause of it, In thy filthiness is lewdness: because I would have purged
thee, and thou wast not purged.

3. The certainty of it, I the Lord have spoken it, etc.

In thy filthiness, In thy sin which is filthiness: Sin so called, 2 Cor. 7. 1.
In thy Idolatry, Covetousness, Pride, Profaneness, Hypocrisy, Oppression.

Is lewdness, obstinacy (for she would not be purged from it) and rejoicing,
Jer. 11. 15.

Because I have purged thee, I have sought to purge thee, by

Admonitions.

Exhortations.

Counsels.

Threatenings.

Reproofs.

Corrections.

And thou wast not ^urged, All labor was in vain and fruitless: As for the
word of the Lord they would not hearken to it, Jer. 44. 16. Zech. 7. 12.

Thou shall not be purged from thy filthiness any more: Thou shall be Warned,
Exhorted, Counseled, Threatened, Reproved no more; but shall be left to perish
in thy sins, as desperate and incurable.

Till I have caused my fury to rest upon thee: Till I have satiated, satisfied
my wrath, and eased my self of my adversaries, and avenged me of mine enemies,
Isa. 1. 24. Till I have purged them in Hell fire says one, which will be ever
doing, but never be done. Doct. God will at last cause his fury to rest upon a
people that will not be purged from their filthiness.



God will, and this will of his is, 1. Most just; Because God has offered them
mercy and they would none of it. Thus,

A Subject commits high Treason against his Prince, for which he is condemned:
His Prince out of pity sends him a pardon, which he rejects, tears and
tramples under foot. If the Prince resolve this man shall dye for it, is not
his resolution just? See Ezra 9. 33. Dan. 9. 14. Lam. 1. 18.

2. Most unchangeable, for Numb. 23. 19.

At last; He is not hasty, but slow to anger.

He being God and not man, Hos. 11. 9. can bear long, and does, yet will not
always, but at last will punish, Isa. 42. 14. and 65. 6. and here in the Text.

Cause his Fury, Anger, Indignation, Wrath. Fury is an anger never at rest till
it has taken revenge.

To Rest, to Abide; Fury has come and gone, judgments have come and gone, have
been sent and called back again, laid on and taken off, for a considerable
time; but at last they shall rest.

Upon a people, though professing, and called by the name of the Lord; though
known and formerly saved by the Lord.

That will not; I say, will not, because the Highest does so often lay the
blame there, Jer. 6. 16.

Their will was against purging, they loved their filthiness: They loved to
wander, Jer. 14 10. and 5. 31. and 11. 15. When thou do evil then thou
rejoycest. See Jer. 18. 12.

Be purged from their filthiness. By any means, whether fair or foul, whether
Warnings, Exhortations, Counsels, Threats, Reproofs, Sabbaths, Sacrifices,
Mercies, Judgments.

Whose Filth, Scum, Rust, remains.

Their Filth, notwithstanding all the Floods they have been in.

Their S^um and Dross notwithstanding all the Fires they have been in.

Their Rust notwithstanding all the Filings they have had.

I might heap Scriptures for proof hereof, but I shall confine my self to this
Prophet, Ez^k. 5. 13. and 9. 8, 9, 10. and 16. 42, 43. and 21. 17.

You may read, Deuteronomy. 29. 20. 2 Chronicles. 36. 15, with 17. Jer. 7. 20. and 11. 14*
and 13. 14. and 14. 12. and 18. 11, 12. Psalm. 7. 12. and 50. 21, 22. and 68. 21.

Reason. Gods Honor, Holiness, Justice and Truth, requires it.

1. Gods Honor, If God spare such, it will be thought that he favors them,
Psalm 50. 21. Mat. 2. 17.

2. His Holiness, Habak. 1. 13.

3. His Justice, Zeph. 3. 5. Psalm. 11, ult. Justice must render to every one
according to etc.

4. His Truth. See Jer. 4. 28.

Use 1. Sad then is the case of such as will not be purged from their
filthiness.

Is it not sad when God will cause his fury to rest upon them, when he is so
resolved as you see, v. 14.

This People, in the Text, might think, and so possibly may you, God would not
be so severe, as the Prophet had told them; They might say or think, Jeremiah
this is but your saying, and you may speak it out of Humor and Discontent.

Nay says God, I the Lord have spoken it; I Jehovah who can and will give
being and life to my threats, to what I have spoken.

They might say, but saying and doing are two things, It may never come to pass
though God has spoken it.

Nay says God, it shall come to pass, as certainly as I have spoken it.

They might say, you threaten us with Nebuchadnezar; but Nebuchadnezar and his
Forces are but men, and may fail, and never be able to perform their enterprise.

But says God, I will do it, and I am not Man, but God.

They might say, but sure God will not lay waste Jerusalem his own City, where
his Temple and Worship is.

To this God answers, True. But thy scum is in thee, and thy filthiness, and in
thy filthiness is lewdness, obstinacy, therefore I will not go back from my
word of threatening.

Thou do not retract, and therefore I will not.

Thou have gone backward, Jer. 15. 6* therefore I will not go back. See also
Jer* 4. 28.

They might say, but God is pitiful, and his compassions fail not.

But says God, I will not pity, n^ spare, nor have mercy, Jer. 13. 14.

They might say, but God will repent of the evil threatened; according to Jer. 18

8. Ezekiel. 20. 8. 9, 13, 14, 17, 22.

No says God, neither will I repen^; you repent not, therefore I will not
repent: See Jer. 15. 6.

They might say then, surely God will deal hardly with us.

No says God, I deal justly, according to thy ways I will judge thee.

What then is there no avoiding of this fury?

No; They shall not be able to escape, Jer. 11. 11.

Evil shall hunt you, Psalm. 140. 11.

And find you out, Numb. 32. 23.

As the blood hound the Thief, as sure as he sets his foot on the ground.

Nor no resisting?

No; Can stubble resist fire.

Why then, I hope, I shall be able to bear it.

No, It will be intolerable, Ezekiel. 22. 14. Can thy heart endure? No.

Why then, I hope, it will have an end.

No neither, if you dye in your filthiness, it shall rest upon you; 'Twill be
everlasting fire and burning, Isa. 33. 14.

Why then, I hope, if it will have no end, it will be long before it have a
beginning.

No, It may have a beginning before you are aware.

It Is to be feared that your iniquities are near full and ripe, for we are come
to that pass now,

1. That, I think, we are shameless in sinning; and if so, see Jer. 3. 3. and
6. 15.

2. Graceless in Profession, and Lukewarm in Religion; and if so, see 2 Timothy 3.
1, to 6. Rev. 3. 15, 16. and 2. 4, 5. Amos 8. 5, 11, 12.

3. Regardless of Christ, nay abusive of Christ's Gospel and Ministers; and if
so, see Matthew. 21. 35, 36, 38, 41. Luke 13. 34, 35. 2 Chronicles. 36. 16. 1 King.
18. 4. with 19. 14. 2 Chronicles. 11. 14.

4. Fruitless under the means of grace; and if so, see Matthew. 21. 43. Luke 13.
6, to 10. Act. 13. 45, 46. Isa. 5. begin. Heb. 6. 6.

5. Incorrigible under the rod; and if so, see Isa. 9. 13, 14. Amos 4. 6, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12.

6. Fearless of punishment; as they, Jer. 17. 15. that said, Where is the word
of the Lord? let it come now.

And as they that said, Isa. 5. 19. Let him make speed and hasten his work,
that we may see it; and let the counsel of the holy One of Israel draw nigh and
come, that we may know it.

And this is but according to what was foretold by our Savior, Luke 17. 26,
27. And as it was in the days of Noe; so shall it be also in the days of the
Son of man. They did eat, they drank, they married wives, etc. till the flood
came.

And by St. Peter, 2 Pet. 3. 3. There shall come in the last days scoffers,
walking after their own lusts (and sure they are come) Saying, Where is the
promise of his coming? Things continue as they were.

But when we put far away the evil day, Amos 6. 3. and say peace and safety,
Then sudden destruction comes, as Travel upon a woman with child, and we shall
not escape, 1 These. 5. 3. God will punish the men that are settled upon the
Lees, That say in their Hearts, The Lord will not do good, neither will he do
evil; Zeph. 1. 12.

God grant our goods may not become a booty; God grant our houses may not
become a desolation; God grant that they who have built houses, may inhabit
them; and that they who have planted vi^eyards, may drink the wine thereof

But sure if in our filthiness there shall be lewdness, if we shall continue
unpurged, notwithstanding all the means used for our purging:

The great day of the Lord is near, it is near, and hastes greatly, even the
voice of the day of the Lord: the mighty man shall cry there bitterly: That day
is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of wasteness and
desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick
darkness; A day of the trumpet and alarm, against the fenced Cities, and
against the high Towers God will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk
like blind men, because they have sinned against the Lord, and their blood
shall be poured out as the dust, and their flesh as the dung. Neither their
Silve nor their Gold shall be able to deliver them is the day of Gods wrath;
but the whole La(...) shall be devoured, by the fire of his jealous(...) for he
shall make even a speedy riddance of a(...) them that dwell in the Land, Zeph.
1. 13, 14* 15, 16, 17, 18.

This is the rejoicing City that dwelt carelessly, that said in her heart, I am,
a(...) there is none beside me: how is she become (...) desolation, a place for
beasts to lie down in(...) every one that passes by her, shall hiss an^ wag
the hand; Zeph. 2. 15. This is spoken of Nineveh, ver. 13. And if we sin as
Nineveh did, may not we expect to suffer as she suffered. Yet I fear we have
many that say as Babylon, I shall be a Lady for ever, Isa. 47. 7.

Therefore hear now this, thou that art given to pleasures, that dwell
carelessly, that say in thy heart, I am, and none else besides me, I shall
not sit as a widow, neither shall I know the loss of Children.

Therefore shall evil come upon thee, thou shall not know from whence it
rises: and mischief shall fall upon thee, thou shall not be able to put it
off: and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly which thou shall not know,
Isa. 47. 11.

Rise up ye woman that are at ease: hear my voice ye careless daughters, give
ear unto my speech. Many days and years shall ye be troubled ye careless
women: for the vintage shall fail, the gathering shall not come. Tremble ye
women that are at ease: be troubled ye careless ones, strip you, and make you
bare, and gird sackcloth on your loins. Because the Palaces shall be for saken,
the multitude of the City shall be left, the forts and towers shall be for dens
for ever, a joy of wild Asses, a pasture of flocks; Isa. 32. 9, 10, 11, 14. See
also Jer. 5. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

These are terrible threats, but who trembles at the reading or hearing of
them? The people in Ezra's time trembled at the words of the God of Israel,
Ezra 9. 4.

Josiah when he heard the words of the Law against Jerusalem and the
inhabitants thereof, rent his clothes and wept, 2 Chronicles. 34. 19, 27.

Habakkuk hears Gods speech and is afraid, chap. 3. 2. Yea, his belly trembled;
his lips quivered; rottenness entered into his bones. chap. 3. 16. variety of
expressions are used by him, to show how sensible he was of Gods threatened
judgments. But oh I fear we are past feeling.

Jeremy also cries out, Jer. 4. 19. M(...) bowels; Nay B^ls^^zz^r Trembled
D(...) 5. 5. 6. when he saw the hand writing (...) the wall; but we see and
read what (...) written against us, and never Tremble.

And Felix trembled when he heard Pa(...) reasoning of righteousness,
temperance, a^^ ^udgment to come, Act. 25. 24. But ho^ often are you reasoned
with about the(...) things, and never tremble?

The Devils tremble, Jam. 2. 19. an^ cannot we? Oh our Atheism and infidelity!
our not fearing Gods threatening in his word, is a manifest token of it.

The God of glory thundereth in the Heavens, and thou tremblest; but when (...)
thunders in the Scripture, thou tremble(...) not: Hear how he thunders, Nahum
1* 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10. Pray take your Bible and read this Scripture before
yo^ read any further.

The Lion roars and the Beasts tremble* But God roars, threatens most terribly
Amos 3. 8. but who fears?

A storm, a tempest, will make yo(...) tremble; and will not that storm,
th(...) tempest threatened, Psalm. 11. 6. make thee ^remble? Upon the wicked (and
art n(...) thou wicked) he shall rain snares, fire and brimsto^e, and an
horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cu^.

Well, Sirs, God would have purged us, and we would not be purged; what then
remains, But a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery indignation,
which shall devour the adversaries, H b. 10. 27.

1. Has not God warned and told thee of the evil and danger of thy sinful
course? thou can not say as Paul, Act. 23. 5. I wist not. I wist not that sin
was so great an evil, that it had so much filth and fire in it. You cannot say
I did not know that sin, that pride, worldliness, rioting, drunkenness,
chambering, wantonness, str^fe, envying, were transgressions of the holy, just,
and good Law of God, and provocations of him to your own and others hurt: you
cannot say you knew not this.

2. Has not God begged and beseeched you to abstain from these fleshly lusts
which war against your souls, 1 Pet. 2. 11.

3. Has not God reproved you, and said to you, as to them, Judge. 2. 2. Why
have you done this?

4. Has not God threatened you, That except you repent you shall perish, Luke
13. 3, 5.

And told you, That if you live after the flesh you shall dye, Romans 8. 13.

5. Has not God corrected and afflicted you, and may we not complain as the
Prophet, Jer. 5. 3. O Lord, thou have stricken them, but they have not grieved:
thou have consumed them, but they have refused to receive correction: they have
made their faces harder then a rock, they have refused to return. See also,
Dan. 9. 13, 14.

6. Has not God said to you as to him, Joh. 5. 14. Sin no more lest a worse
thing come unto you. And told you, That if ye will not be reformed by those
things, that have come upon you, but will walk contrary to him; that he will
then walk contrary to you, and will punish you yet seven times for your sins;
Levit. 26. 23, 24.

7. Has not God after all this said, Return unto me, and I will not cause mine
anger to fall upon you; for I am merciful, and will not keep anger for ever;
Jer. 3. 1, 7, 12.

Has he not said, W^sh ye, make ye (...)an, etc. Though your sins be as
scarlet, they shall be white as s^ow, Isa. 1 16, 18.

8. Has not God sworn that he desires not your death; Saying, As I live, I
have ^o pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that he turn from his way and
live, Ezekiel. 33. 11.

9. Has not God after this expostulated with you, and said, Turn ye, Turn ye,
why will ye dye? Ezekiel. 33. 11. and Jer. 13. 27. Will thou not be made clean?
when shall it once be?

10. Has he not waited to be gracious to thee, Isa. 13. 18. Has he not been
longsuffering to you ward, not willing that you should perish, but that you
should come to repentance, 2 Pet. 3. 9.

And now sinner, tell me, would not God have purged thee: and if thou would
not, If thou would not take warning, when warning was given thee; nor be
prevailed with to abstain from fleshly lusts, when thou wast beseeched; nor be
reformed when thou wast reproved; nor return when thou wast smitten; nor regard
when expostulated with; nor come to repentance when so long waited for: May not
God say to thee, as to the woman, Genesis 3. 13. What is this that thou have done?
and as to Adam, Genesis 3. 11. Have thou ^aten of the Tree, whereof I commanded
that thou should not eat? So, sinner what is this that thou have done? Have
thou set at naught all my counsel, and would thou none of my reproof? Prove.
1. 25. Oh what is this that thou have done? Do thou know what thou have
done? Can thou conceive the dishonor thou have brought to God, and the
misery thou have brought upon thy self, and the hurt thou have done to Church
and State? Art thou not in danger of the resting of Gods fury upon thee; when
Gods anger is kindled but a little, you are in danger of perishing, Psalm. 2.
12. In what case then will you be, when his fury shall rest upon you.

And God will watch to bring it upon you, Jer. 44. 27. Behold I will watch over
them for evil, and not for good; as one that purposly watches and lies in
wait to do mischief, Psalm. 56 6.

God has been woe(...) when provoked, to watch over people, to pluck up and
break down, Jer. 31. 28.

And Daniel, chap. 9. 13, 14* confesses, that because God had p(...)shed them,
and they had not made their prayer before the Lord their God, that they might
^urn from their iniquities and understand the truth; therefore the Lord (...)
watched upon the evil, and brought it upon them. And he gives the reason, For
the Lord our God is righteous in all his works, for we obeyed not his voice.

Use 2. If all this be so, then consider we* our selves, Are we purged from our
filthiness?

Is England?

Is London?

Are we?

Is our s^um gone out?

Our rust gotten off?

Our filth done away?

Our dross separated from us?

Our chafe scattered and burnt?

2. Let me ask you a few Questions.

1. Have you been con^inced of your natural and contracted filthiness? Si^s
were you clean born, shaped in holiness? Read, Ioh 14. 4. Psalm. 51. 5. and see
whether you were or no.

Have you lived without defiling your selves? See Psalm. 14. 3. Mark 7. 23.

What were your Hearts, and Hands? If you cannot tell, See Jer. 4. 14. Jam.
(...). 8. Mark 7. 21, 22, 23.

What were your Heads, Ears, Eyes, and Tongues? If you be ignorant, s(...) John
13. 9. Act. 7. 51. Jer. 6. 10. 2 Pe^. 2. 14. Matthew. 5. 28. James 3. 6. Ephesians 4.
29.

I fear many are not yet convinced of their filthiness; and if so, sure not yet
purged from it.

Some will not believe that to be filthiness which Ged says is so; All that is
in the world is either the lust of the eye, etc. 1 John 2. 16* and these are
not of the pure and holy God, but of the dirty sinful world which lies in
wickedness.

1. The lust of the Eye; covetousness, which you call by another name* viz.
Good Hu^bandry, is ^^lthine^s, 1 Peter (...). 2.

2. The lust of the Flesh; rio^ing, drunkenn(...)* chambering, wantonness;
which you call Good Fellowship, Courtship, Courteousness: This is filthiness,
but you ^o not know it, or will not know it; for your better information, see 1
These. 4. 7. Ephesians. 5. 3, 4. Ro^. 13. 13.

3. Pride of Life; this also is filthiness, though you call it fineness,
neatness, ^omliness: But see what God calls it, Isa. 4. 4. He calls it filth,
ordure, or excrements, the word imports all; all such filth, or excrement, as
come^ forth from the body, either upward, as Isa. 28. 8. 2 Pet. 2. 22. or
downward, as Deuteronomy. 23. 14. Ezekiel 4. 12.

The filth of the Daughters of Zion; whose pride, vanity, wantonness, and other
excesses, had no small hand in pulling down Gods judgments. See Isa. 3. 16, 17.
had it been the Daughters of Moab, Numb. 25. 1. or the Daughters of the
Philistines, Judge. 14. 1, 2. that had been so filthy it would not have provoked
so much; their filth would not have stunk so bad, nor have been so loathsome in
the sight of God. But for the Daughters of Zion, and the Daughters of
Jerusalem, and the Daughters of Israel and Judah, of Professors, to be so
filthily proud, provoked greatly. Had it been only the Daughters of men, Genesis
6. 2. or the Daughters of a strange god, Mal. 2. 11. or the Daughters of the
uncircumcised, 2 San. 1. 20. it had not been so much; but for the Daughters of
God, Deuteronomy 32. 19. to go thus, and do thus, and (...) thus, he could not bear it.

Their gates, and garbs, and courses, and carriages, that they prided
themselves in, and accounted their bravery, Isa. 3. 18. were filth; and such as
made them odious, loathsome, and abominable in Gods eye; says one whose
Judgment; I think, is not to be contemned, ^ataker in loc.

And see, says he, the contrary required, 1 Timothy 2. 9, 10. 1 Pet. 3. 3, 4.

So that I believe, that which you call fineness now, will be found to be
filthiness another day; that which you call (...)nery, will be found to be
fil^hery.

Those fine Heads,

Fine Faces,

Fine Necks,

Fine Back and Breast,

Fine Arms and Shoulders,

Will be found, I believe, to be Filthy, Heads, Faces, Necks, Backs and
Breasts, Arms and Shoulders.

Wherefore let me be speak you, as Daniel did N^buchadnezar, Dan. 4. 27.

Wherefore O fine Dames, let my counsel be acceptable to you; Break off your
pride by humility, and your shamelesness by shamefastness. And get ye quickly
to the fountain opened for sin and uncleanness, Zech. 13. 1. and wash your
selves. Say to Christ, as Peter, when Christ told him, If he washed not his feet
he should have no part in me: O Lord, said he, not my feet only, but my hands
and head also. You have need to say, not my feet only, but my face, neck,
back, breast, arms and shoulders also.

Quest. 2. Has the Word, the pure Word of God, (so called, Psalm. 12. 6. Psalm
119. 140.) been instrumental in your purging, Psalm. 119. 9. Psalm. 17. 4. Joh.
17. 17.

Quest. 3. Has time been spent about it? Have you had your washing, scowring
and purging days for your Souls, as you-have had for the cleaning of your
Clothes, Brass and Pew^er, and for preservation of the health of your Bodies.
Some wash their Linen once a month, and scowr their Vessels once a quarter,
and purge their Bodies Spring and Fall. Deal truly, what time have you set a
part for the washing and purging of your Heads, Hearts, and Hands? Have you
your monthly, quarterly, and half-yearly washing and purging days for your
Souls? Will not Linen, Brass and Pewter Vessels be made clean, nor Bodies be
purged without allowing time? And will Hearts and Souls be purged from their
filthiness without allowing time?

Quest. 4. Has pains been taken about it? Has this purging of your selves cost
you Prayers and Tears before 'twas done? That which is foul will not be made
clean without pains-taking. Naaman was at the pains of taking a long journey,
to be cleansed from his Leprosy, 2 King. 5.

Quest. 5. Have you made your applica^ion to Christ about your cleansing and
purging, as once Naaman did to the Prophet, 2 King. 5.

1. Naaman knew himself to be a Leper.

2. Naaman hearing of a Prophet that could cure him, comes to him, 2 King. 5.
3, 9. to his door.

3. Receives direction what to do for his Cure, and though averse at first to
use that means, yet upon his servants entreaties, resolves to make trial of the
means, 2 King. 5. 13, 14.

4. He does and practices accordingly, goes down into the River and dips
himself seven times therein, 2 King. 5. 14.

5. He returns, being Cured, to show his thankfulness, 2 King. 5. 15. and to
testify his great respect to the Prophet, as the instrument of his Cure; as
did the tenth Leper, Luke 17. 15.

6. He acknowledges the God of Israel to be the only true God, and his cure to
be wrought by him, 2 King. 5. 15.

7. He resolves upon the worshipping and serving of the true God, renouncing
all other gods, 2 King. 5. 17.

In like manner,

1. Have you known your selves to be leprous and unclean; and said as Isaiah,
chap. 6. 5.

2. Having heard of Christ, and the efficacy of his blood to cleanse you, have
you come to his door and waited for direction, what to do that you might be
cleansed? Have you waited daily at the posts of his doors? Prove. 8. 34. Have
you sat at Jesus's feet, and heard his word, Luke 10. 39. as Mary did?

3. Having heard counsel and direction what to do to be Cured, viz. To go into
the Jordan of Christ's blood, and to bathe your selves therein; Have you
resolved, upon the entreaties of Gods Ministers, who are are your servants, 2
Cor. 4. 5. to make trial of this Jordan? and with Esther, to go into King
Jesus, come of it what will: Saying, I will go in, and if I perish, I perish,
Esth. 4. 16.

And have you resolved with the prodigal, Luke 15. To go unto Christ the
everlasting father, Isa. 9.

4. Have you done accordingly? Have you dipped your selves in this bloody
Jordan seven times? Have you-gone into King Jesus, as Esther into King
Ahasueru^? And as the Prodigal, to his Father? Have you been at the fountain
opened for sin and uncleanness? Zech. 13. 1. Have you rested upon this blood of
Christ which cleanses from all sin, 1 John 1. 7. for your cleansing, and
expected it according to the promise? Ez^k 36. 25.

5. Do you find your hearts stirred up to be thankful, for this Jordan of
Chri^ts blood, and the blessings we have thereby? Can you do as Peter and Paul?
as Peter, 1 Pet. 1. 3. as Paul, Ephesians. 1. 3.

6. Do you give Christ the glory of being the alone fountain for cleansing, and
acknowledge all your cleansing to be from him; There being no salvation from
the filthiness of sin in any other? Act. 4. 12.

7. Do you resolve upon serving God in righteousness and holiness all your
days, As they that are delivered from their filthiness are bound to do? Luke 1.
74, 75.

Quest. 6. Are you careful to keep your selves clean? Do you shun all
defilements by persons or things? Is it your care to keep your self unspotted,
as pure Religion binds you to do? Jam. 1. 27. Do you hate the garment spotted
by the flesh? Jude 23. And abstain from all appearance of evil, 1 These. 5. 22.

Quest. 7. Are you companions of those that are purged? David, Psalm. 119. 63.
was a companion of all them that feared God, and of them that kept his
precepts. Are you so too? David's delight was in them, Psalm. 16. 3. Is your
delight in them too? Birds of a Feather will flock together.

Use 3. Of Exhortation,

If it be so as you have heard, then continue no longer in your filthiness.

Wash ye, make ye clean, lay a part all filthiness and supersiuity of
naughtiness, James 1. 21.

Cleanse your selves from all filthiness of flesh and spirit, 2 Cor. 7. 1.

Cast it away, and say unto it, get thee hence, Isa. 30. 2.

Motives.

1. It Is filthiness; Will a man continue in filth, in dirt and mire: In the
filth of the lust of the eye, the lust of the flesh, and the pride of life?

2. God would that you should be purged; for,

First, He calls upon you, wash, as you have heard.

Secondly, God has prepared a fountain to wash in, Zech. 13. 1.

Thirdly, God expostulates with you about it, Jer. 13. 27. Will thou not be
made clean?

Fourthly, God thinks it long, till you be purged, Jer. 4. 14. How long shall
thy vain thoughts lodge within th^e? And Jerem. 13. 27. When shall it once be?

3. When you are purged, washed, God will take delight in you, and have
fellowship with you, Isa. 1. 16, 18.

Means.

1. Take the glass of the Law, and view your selves therein, that will show you
your filthiness: I had not known sin but by the Law, said Paul, Romans 7. 7.

2. Know the power of Gods anger, Psalm. 90. 11. you may see it in his terrible
threats, and the judgments which he executes, Psalm. 9. 16.

3. Assent to the truths of Gods threatenings. Say often to thy own soul, it
will be as God has said: Fury will rest, settle upon me, if I continue
unpurged from my filthiness.

4. Confess your natural and contracted filthiness, as did David, Psalm. 51. 5.
and then see, 1. John 1. 9.

5. Pray, purge me, wash me, cleanse me, Create in me a clean heart, as David
did Psalm. 51.

6. Above all getting, get faith, for it is faith that purifies the heart, Act.
15. 9.

First, Hear for it, for it comes by hearing, Romans 10.

Secondly, Give God no rest till he has given it you.

7. Act faith in the cleansing blood of Christ: It cleanses away all sin,
being sprinkled and applied, 1 John 1. 7. 1 Pet. 1. 2. Go to the fountain
opened for sin and uncleanness, Zech. 13. 1.

Say to thine own soul.

1. I am filthy, even filthiness; My mind and conscience is d filed, Tit. 1.
15. I am a person of u clean lips, Isa. 6. 5. for how can he be clean who is
born of a woman? Job 25. 4. Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? Job
14. 4. Behold I am shapen in iniquity, and in sia did my mother conceive me,
Psalm. 51. 5. Besides, How aboninable and filthy am I, who have drank iniquity
like water? Job 15. 16. Oh wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from
the body of this death? Romans 7. 24.

1. The body of sin, Romans 6. 6. called a body, because it has many members,
Col. 3. 5.

A body of death, because it tends to death, and threaten* death.

2. Say to thy own soul, Christ's blood was shed to cleanse from this filthiness
of sin. And that,

First, By Gods own appointment, Act. 2. 23. 1 Pet. 1. 20.

Secondly, For this very purpose,

Zech. 13. 1. 1 John 3. 5, 8. Isa. 53. 5.

3. Say to thy own soul, Jesus Christ in the Ministry and preaching of the
Gospel, has been evidently set forth crucified before mine eyes, Gal. 3. 1. God
has set him forth to be a propitiation threugh (...)ith in his blood, Romans 3.
25. Not only in his eternal counsel, and afterward in the execution of the same
in the fullness of time, but by the preaching of the Gospel, 2 Timothy 1. 10, 11.
and 1 Pet. 1. 20. He was manifested in these last times for us, not only in
respect of his incarnation, but in respect of the Revelation of him in the
preaching of the Gospel, since his Incarnation: So also God has set him forth
to be a Bath to wash us from our filthiness, Rev. 1. 5.

4. Say to thy soul, This blood of Christ is precious blood. 1 Pet. 1. 19.
powerful and effcacious to effect that for which 'twas shed, viz. The cleansing
away of sin. Though the blood of Bulls and Goats could not take away sin, yet
this precious blood of the Lamb of God can; See Heb. 10. 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,
13, 14.

5. Say to thy self, This blood of Christ is the only Bath, for the soul;
There Is no other fountain, no other name, no way else to be cleansed, Act. 4.
12. 1 Timothy 2. 5.

6. Say to thy own soul, I must wash in this Bath or else be for ever unclean,
and unpurged, and so never enter into Heaven; F^r there shall in no wise enter
in any thing that defiles, Rev. 21. 27. But Gods wrath and fury will rest and
abid^ upon me for ever, Joh. 3. 36.

7. Say to thy own soul, I am invited to Bathe in this blood of Christ, to
apply it by faith, for my cleansing: It Is offered to me, Isa. 55. 1. Act. 10.
43. To him give all the Prophets witness, that through his Name, whosoever
believes on him shall receive remission of sins: And Rev. 22. 17. Whosoever
will, let him take of this water of life freely.

8. Say to thy own soul, I am commanded to accept of the offer, to Bathe in
this fountain, to rest on Christ for cleansing; To look unto him to be saved
from my filthiness, Isa. 45 22. So that, as soul as I am, it will be no
presumption in me to come and wash in this Jordan: Christ calls me, Matthew. 11.
28. Come unto me all ye that are heavy laden with dirt and filth.

Say to thy own soul, I am promised by him who is true and faithful; Even the
true God, and eternal life, 1 John 5. 20. That if I come to him for cleansing,
I shall in no wise be cast out, refused, John 6. 37. Why then should I not obey
this command, and believe and rest on Christ for my cleansing?

10. Yet once more, that you may act faith in the blood of Christ for
cleansing; say to thy own soul, was not I baptized for the remission of sins,
Act. 2. 38. Repent and be baptized, in the name of Christ, for the remission of
sins: 1. For assurance that your sins are forgiven you for Christ's sake: So
Act. 22. 16. Arise and be baptized, and wash away thy sins (according to the
Du^ch Annotations) For a sign And seal that thy sins are washed away, by the
blood and spirit of Christ.

To improve thy Baptism in order to thy cleansing,

1. Say to thy self, Does not water in Baptism signify and seal by Divine
Institution? Is it not an ordinance of Jesus Christ? Matthew. 28. 18, 19, 20.

2. Say to thy self, Does not water in Baptism signify and seal the cleansing
blood of Christ, and our justification and sanctification thereby? Know then
not O my soul, that they who are baptized into Jesus Christ, are baptized into
his death? Romans 6. 3. 1. To partake of the benefits of his death.

3. Say to thy self, was not this water applied to me? and that, in the Name of
the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost?

4. Was it not applied to me in a solem^ way, in the presence of the holy
Trinity, with a declaration of the institution of Baptism by Christ, and with
prayer to God in the name of Christ, that his blood represented by the water
might cleanse me.

5. Say to thy self, Is not my Baptism my bond, obliging me to apply that blood
of Christ to my soul, which was represented by the water which was applied to
my body?

6. Say again Have I applied it, and am I cleanfed from my filthiness?

7. If not, say to thy soul, Is not my case as bad as the case of unbaptized
Infidels? See Jer. 9. 25, 26.

8. And if so, say to thy soul, How can my conscience be quiet, and let me
alone in such a case?

Wherefore lay a charge upon thy self, to believe, to receive, and rest upon
Christ for cleansing, as he is offered in the Gospel. Say, Believe O my soul,
go to the fountain, will thou dye in thy filth, and under the fury of the
Almighty God?

GODS Severity against MAN for Iniquity.
Isa. 65. 6. Behold, it is written before me: I will rot keep silence, but will
recompense, even (...)compence into their boson.
BEhold, observe, take notice of it; It is written before me: It is written:
First, What? Secondly, Where?

First, What? Your iniquities, verse. 7. Sin, Jer. 17. 1.

Your rejecting Christ.

Secondly, Where? In Gods book; we enter in books such matters as we would not
have forgotten. Thus Ezra 4. 15, 19. and 6. 2. Esth. 6. 1.

So God also has books of remembrance, not only of what,

1. Is done for him, Mal. 3. 16. Psalm. 56. 8.

2. But against him, Deuteronomy. 32. 34. Hos. 7. 2.

The meaning is, God keeps it in mind as well as if it were booked down.

Before me; It lies before my face, that it may not be forgotten.

q. d. Their wicked doings are upon record with me, and this record always
lies open before my face.

They did it, Isa. 65. 3. to my face, or in my sight, as Deuteronomy. 31. 29. Psalm
51. 4 and it remains still before him.

I will not keep silence; i. e. I will no longer forbear as I have hitherto
done.

But will recompense, even recompense into their bosom; or will repay, yea
repay into their lap.

1. Certainly, undoubtedly; therefore is the threat doubled, to put it out of
doubt.

2. Abundantly, largely, as repaying into their bosom or lap signifies; he will
recompense and repay them, not by tail, measure, or weight; but by pouring
forth into the receivers lap without any regard how much. Doct. Though God
delay the execution of vengeance for some time, yet at length he will
undoubtedly and abundantly pour out his wrath upon impenitent sinners.



First, God delays to execute vengeance for a time.

Secondly, At length he will take vengeance.

1. God delays for a time to take vengeance, Psalm. 50. 21. Isa. 42. 14.

Thus God did bear long with the old world, 1 Pet. 3. 20.

He will avenge at last though he bear long, Luke 18. 7.

After a long time the Lord of those servants comes and reckons, Mat. 25. 19.

Though God keep silence for a time, yet he will speak at last. See Habak. 2. 3.

Reasons.

Negatively, Not because God is slack, as we are too apt to conceive, Psalm. 51.
^1.

No, not as if God were slack, backward through weakness, forgetfulness or
fickleness and inconstancy, 2 Pet. 3. 9.

They are not slack that are long ere they come, but they that come not at the
due and appointed time. Now God never stays beyond that time, Heb. 10. 37.
Habak. 2. 3. So then this is not the Reason: but,

Affirmatively, 1. Because God is longsuffering, 2 ^et. 3. 9. willing that we
should have time and means to repent, and so not perish. See Romans 2. 4.

2. To leave sinners at last without excuse, as Prove. 5. 11, 12, 13.

3. Because he has an eternity wherein to be revenged on them.

2. At length God will take vengeance, etc.

He will do it, Psalm. 50. 21, 22. Isa. 42. 14. Ezekiel. 24. 13, 14.

Consider we a little,

First, Who it is that will recompense?

Secondly, How he will do it.

Thirdly, When.

Fourthly, Why.

First, Who it is?

He to whom it belongs, and who claims a propriety in it; Deuteronomy. 32. 35. Romans
12. 19.

Who this is? See Jer. 32. 18, 19. Nah. 1. 2. Jer. 51. 56.

Secondly, He will do it,

1. Abundantly, plentifully, Psalm. 79. 12. Sevenfold, seven times more, and
seven times more, Levit. 26. 23, 24.

He poures it out, Nah. 1. 6.

2. Terribly, Joel 2. 11, 31. Isa. 2. 19.

What terrible things did he do by the Red Sea? Psalm. 116. 22. See Nah. 1. 6.

So terribly that the ears of those that hear shall tingle, 1 Samuel 3. 11. 2
King. 21. 12. Jer. 19. 3. Shall have his ears stricken with horror and
astonishment, at the report of it, though he see it not. See also, Psalm 119.
53, 120. Ezekiel 21. 7.

Thirdly, Certainly, surely, Jer. 51. 56. and therefore is the threat,

1. Doubled in the Text, and Isa. 59. 18.

2. Sworn to; God swears he will do it, Dent. 32. 40, 41.

3. Written down, Exodus 17. 14. and 34. 27.

Or thus, God will do it: For,

1. He has said it.

2. Said it again and again in the Text, Ezekiel. 24. 14.

3. Sworn it, Deur. 32. 40, 41.

4. Set his hand to it, written it, Exodus 34. 27.

5. Sealed it, Deuteronomy. 32. 34.

Thirdly, When? In due time, Deuteronomy. 32. 34, 35. Joel 3. 13.

When (...) is ripe, Genesis 15. 16.

Their iniquities were,

Execrable Idolatry.

Grievous Oppression.

Prodigious Lust.

These were not yet full, not at their growth. Sin comes to it by degrees, Jer.
51. 13. Dan. 8. 23. Matthew. 23. 32.

Fourthly, Why? Because Gods Holiness, Justice, Truth, and Honor requires it.

1. His Holiness; Which is such, that he cannot away with iniquity, Hab. 1. 13.
See Isa. 1. 13.

2. His Justice; He must render to every one according to his doings, how else
can he be just, Romans 2. 6, 9. Jerem. 32. 19.

3. His Truth, and Oath requires it; he has said it, and doubled it; and sworn
it, and caused it to be written, as you have heard.

4. His Honor; See Mal. 2. 17.

5. Their enmity to God and his people requires it, Psalm. 83. 1, to 6.

6. Gods Sovereignty over all requires it, Psalm 83. 18. with the foregoing
verses.

Use.

First, Of Admonition.

1. Be not hardened in your sins, because sentence is not presently executed;
See Eccles. 8. 11.

For God, you hear, will punish at length.

2. Be not mockers and scoffers as they, 2 Pet. 3. 4.

For God will punish at length.

Nor like them, Isa. 5. 19. ^er. 17. 15. Psalm. 14. 1. But let such read, Isa.
22. 13. 14.

Seeing this is so, will you take the course prescribed, that if possible none
of these things may come upon you; or if they should, that your eternal estate
may be secured.

First, What can you object against it?

1. Is it not the course that God has prescribed. That it is, has been proved
before; therefore you cannot object, it is not required; you cannot say, Who has
required this; for you have heard that God does.

2. Is there any unreasonableness or unrighteousness in the prescribing of it?
Can you object against it as being unreasonable and unrighteous? nay is it not
most reasonable and righteous, that having sinned and provoked God, you should
consider, confess, humble, etc.

3. Is it not that course that others with success have used? as Nineveh, and 2 Chronicles. 12. 7, 12.

Can you object, and say, others have taken this course to no purpose? Ahabs
external humiliation was not without some success? The judgment was deferred
upon it, 1 King. 21. 29.

4. Have not others perished for want of taking this course: See 2 Chronicles. 36.
12. of Zed^ki^ to 18. Dan. 5. 22, to 29. of Bel^hazar.

Can you now object, and say, others have neglected this course and done well
enough?

Thus you see you cannot object against this course.

Secondly, Can you think of a better, a safer course? Can you, or you, or you,
etc. speak if you can; by your silence I take it for granted that you cannot.

Thirdly, If you cannot, are you resolved upon this? To consider, confess, etc.

Fourthly, If you be not resolved on this course as yet; must I dismiss you
unresolved and desperate as they, Jer. 44. will you say as they, ver. 16. and
18. 12.

FINIS.
GODS Gracious Presence, THE SAINTS Great Privilege.
2 These. 3. 16. Now the Lord of Peace, himself give you Peace always, by all
means. The Lord be with you all.
YOU have Peace (Blessed be God) long may it last; it is not like to be
long-lived, unless God work wonderfully. Application therefore should be made
to him, that he who is the God of Peace would be pleased to give it always,
and by all means.

The close of the Verse is that which I intend to say something unto, as the
Lord shall enable me.

The Lord be with you All.

This is Paul's Valediction to the Thessalonians, and shall be mine to you. In
this Valediction you have,

1. Paul's wish and desire, the Lord be with you.

2. The extent of it, The Lord be with you All. He leaves out none of them, he
wishes well to them all; and that which he wishes is the Presence of the Lord
with them, All their welfare standing therein.

The Lord, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost; we must not
leave out any of the Three, for we cannot be without the Presence of any one of
them; nor can you have the Presence of the one without the Presence of the
other, for these three are one, and where One is All are. Of the Fathers, and
of the Sons, and of the Holy Ghosts coming to be with his People. You read Joh.
14. Jesus said, if a man love me, he will keep my words, and my Father will
love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him. O for faith
to believe this! that the Father and the Son will come and make their abode
with such. Whosoever goes from you, you may be sure the Father and Son will
come, if you love him and keep his words, See verse 23. And for the coming of
the Holy Ghost See Joh. 15. 16. I will pray the Father, says Christ (Here Is a
praying friend, and praying friends we use to say are our best friends) and he
shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever, even the
Spirit of Truth, verse 17. That he may abide with you for ever, mark that; when
he comes, he will not be like a wayfaring man that comes for a night, and then
is gone, but he will abide for ever: when I came down from Heaven, I came with a
purpose to return again, when I had done my work here, but this Comforter, my
Spirit, shall abide with you for ever. Well then the Lord be with you, the
Father Son and Holy Spirit be with you, the eternal Jehovah, who has his being
of himself, and gives being to all things else, even the being of performance
to his promises; This Lord be with you, Be with your whole man, This Lord be
with your Bodies, This Lord be with your Souls, This Lord be with every part of
your Bodies, and with every Power of your Souls. The Apostle in his former
epistle, praying for these Thessalonians. 1 These. 5. 23. Prays thus, The very
God of Peace sanctify you wholly, and I pray God your whole Spirit, and Soul
and Body be preserved blameless, unto the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. So
then the Apostle would have the Lord ^o be with their whole man, not with a
part of it, not with their Souls and Spirits only, or Bodies only, but with
their Spirit Soul and Body: and the same Apostle praying for Timothy, prays,
The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy Spirit, 2 Timothy 4. 22. It matters not who are
absent, so Christ be present; his presence is more, then the presence of the
nearest and dearest relations. The Lord be with you all, not only with a part
of you, I know not which of you to leave out of my Prayers: For you all have
need of Gods presence, whether you be Saints or Sinners. If Sinners, you have
need of the Lord to be with you, to convince you and convert you. And as for
those that are Saints, I know none that have so much grace that they need no
more, the Lord therefore be with them, to establish, confirm, and increase
grace in them; the Lord be with you at all times. If God be absent at any time,
we know not what to do. Some of you have had experience, that when God has
withdrawn never so little, your case has been bad enough. The Lord be with you
in all places. We can be secure and safe in no place without his presence.

The Lord be with you in all conditions, in all estates; for if you be in the
most prosperous estate, you cannot tell how to be without God. Jehosaphat
thought so, 2. Chron. 20. 12. In the fullness of a man's sufficiency he may be in
straights. Job 20. 22. You cannot be any where, in any estate, a minute without
him. You believe it to be a Truth, that in him you live, move, and have your
being, Act. 17. 28. not naturally only, but spiritually too. The Lord therefore
be with you at all times, in all conditions, in sickness and in health, in
peace and in trouble, in all Adversity and in all Prosperity. The Lord be with
you with all kind of Aids, Helps, and Assistances, variety of Aids and
Assistances we need. This is the sense and meaning of this vale dictory Prayer,
the Lord be with you all. The observation that I shall commend to you, is this,

Doct. God with us is a privilege greatly to be desired, and much to be prayed
for.

The Apostle makes this Prayer for the Thessalonians whom he dearly loved, who
were his hope and joy, and Crown of Rejoicing, 1 These. 2. 19. Could he have
thought of a greater mercy, he would have wished it to them. In speaking to this
great Truth, I shall show,

1. That there is a presence of God with his people.

2. That this presence of God is a great privilege.

3. That this great privilege is much to be desired and prayed for.

4. The reasons of it.

5. And after this apply it.

1. There is a presence of God with his people. I speak not of the general
presence of God, whereby he is not far from every one of us, Act. 17. 27. For
in him we live, move, and have our being: v. 28. not only as we had our being
from him at first, but we have our being in him, as the Beam has its Being in
the Sun. Of this presence of God you read Psalm. 139. from which there is no
fleeing, v. 7. he is every where, v. 8, 9, I fill Heaven and Earth says the
Lord, Jer. 23. 24. and Isa. 66. 1. Thus says the Lord, Heaven is my Throne,
and the Earth my foot stool. This general presence of God, if seriously
considered, and believingly apprehended, would be of great use. But it is the
special presence of God that I am to speak to, his favorable and gracious
presence, such as that wished and desired by Aaron and his Sons of old, Number. 6.
24, 25, 26. The Lord bless thee, and keep thee, the Lord make his face shine
upon thee, and be gracious unto thee, the Lord lift up his Countenance upon
thee, and give thee peace. This blessing is says Ainsworth, expounded by the
Apostle 2 Cor. 13. 14. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God,
and the communion of the Holy Ghost be with you all. Thus the first branch of
the blessing v. 24. The Lord bless thee and keep thee, implies the love of the
Father.

The second branch v. 25. The Lord make his face shine upon thee, and be
gracious unto thee, implies the grace of the Son.

And the third branch, The Lord lift up his Countenance upon thee, and give
thee peace, implies the communion with the Holy Ghost. Now this Loving,
Gracious, Communicative presence of Jehovah, Father Son a(...) Holy Ghost, is
that Presence of the Lord which is so great a privilege, and so much to be
desired. The Lords presence with us to bless us, with all Spiritual blessings
in heavenly places in Christ. Ephesians. 1. 3. And to keep us from evil, Joh. 17. 15.
And to make his face shine upon us, that we may be saved. Psalm. 80. 3. 7, 19.
And to be gracious to us through Christ Jesus, Ephesians. 2. 7. And to lift up his
countenance upon us, that Gladness may be in our hearts. Psalm. 4. 8. And to
give us peace, that peace which passes all understanding, and that which may
guard our hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. Phil. 4. 7. This, this is the
presence of God which is so desirable, and of which I am to treat. That there
is such a presence of God with his people, appears thus.

1. God Asserts it.

2. Promises it.

3. Has evidenced it.

4. Gods people have acknowledged it.

1. God Asserts that there is such a presence of His with his people. Isa. 41.
10. Fear thou not, says God, for I am with thee. And Ezekiel. 48. 35. The name of
the City from that day shall be, The Lord is there.

2. God has promised it, Ezekiel. 26. 11, 12. I will set my Tabernacle among you,
and my Soul shall not abhor you. And I will walk among you, and will be your
God, and ye shall be my people.

3. God has evidenced it, by Preservations, Assistances, Deliverances and
Su^cesses vouchsafed to his people. What a mighty, Gracious, pardoning presence
o^ God, was with Moses and the Children of Israel, in bringing them out of
Egypt, through the Red Sea, and through the Wilderness into Canaan. Read the
story of it in the Book of Exodus, especially the Song of Moses, Exodus 15. What
a presence of God was with David, Spi^iting, Prospering and Preserving him,
when hunted like a Partridge upon the Mountains: Whence was it that he was not
Caught? there were Skilful Hunters, yet he escaped the Snare, for the Lord was
with him.

What a mighty presence of God was there with Daniel! He will pray, that he
will, though he be torn in pieces for it. He will not cease to make his
Supplications to God three times a day, though there were a Law made against
it. Daniel would not fail to be with God, and God would not fail to be with
Daniel. What! would Daniel be with God to the Hazard of his life? Yes. And was
not God with him for his Preservation? Daniel is cast into the Den of Lions:
Was he torn or hurt by them? No, The Lions were muzled, their Mouths were shut,
God shut them, Dan. 6. 22. My God, says Daniel, has sent his Angel, and has
shut the Lions mouths that they shall not hurt me. Though men will not be
obedient, yet Lions will: touch not my Servant Daniel, says God to the Lions,
and they are as quiet as Lambs. Touch not mine anointed, says God to men, and
do my Prophets no harm: yet men will not obey.

What a presence of God was there with those three noble Jews when threatened,
if they would not bow, they should burn! They will bow to none but God, Dan 3.
17, 18. They will not loose their interest in God, to gain an Interest in the
greatest. Then the King commanded that they should be bound and cast into the
Fiery Furnace, v. 20. being cast into it, the Fire burned their executioners,
and the bonds wherewith they were bound, but had no Power on their Bodies, nor
was there a Hair of their Head singed, neither were their Coats changed, nor
had the smell of Fire passed on them, Dan. 3. 27. and how came this to pass?
God was with them.

What a presence of God had Paul with him? At my first Answer, says he, no man
stood with me, but all men forsook me, I pray God that it may not be laid to
their Charge: notwithstanding the Lord stood with me and strengthened me, and I
was delivered out of the mouth of the Lion, 2 Timothy 4. 16, 17.

What a presence of God was there with those that had trial of cruel Mockings
and Scourgings, of Bonds and Imprisonments, of Stoning, and Sawing asunder, of
wandering, Wants, Afflictions and Torments, and yet accepted not deliverance
upon unwarrantable terms. Heb. 11. 35, 36, 37.

4. This presence of God has been acknowledged by his People. Behold, says
Abijah to Jeroboam and all Israel, God himself is with us for our Captain: ye
be a great multitude, and there be with you golden Calves which Jeroboam has
made you for Gods, you have Idol Gods with you; but God himself is with us, 2 Chronicles. 13. 8. 12.

This presence of God was also acknowledged by Hezekiah, 2 Chronicles. 32. 8,
Speaking of Sennacherib and his Army, with him is an Arm of flesh, but with us
is the Lord our God, to help us and to fight our Battles. God was with them,
not as an idle Spectator, but as a Powerful Assister and Helper.

It was also acknowledged by Jeremie. The Lord is with me as a mighty terrible
one, herefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail, they
shall be greatly a^amed, ^er. 20. 11. And by the Church, Psalm. 46. 7. The Lord
of Hosts is with us, the God of Jacob is our Refuge. So Isa. 8. 10. Take
counsel together, says the Lord by the Prophet to the Adversaries of the
people, and it shall come to naught, for God is with us. The Lord is on my
side, I will not fear what can man do unto me. Psalm. 118. 6, 7. you see how
great a truth this is, that there is a special presence of God with his people.
God asserts it, promises it, evidenceth it, and his people have acknowledged
it. The next thing I premised to show you, is that

2. This presence of God with his people is a great privilege, it is a token of
sin ding grace in his sight, Exodus 33. 16. And it God be with us,

1. He is with us as a father with his children, 2 Cor. 6. 18.

2. As a Husband with his Wife. Isa. 54. 5. Jer. 31. 32.

3. As one friend with another. Isa. 41. 8.

4. As a Shepherd with his flock, Psalm. 23. 1.

5. As a Captain with his company. Behold God himself is with us for our
Captain, 2 Chronicles. 13. 12.

When Joshua was by Jerico, there stood a man over against him, with his Sword
drawn in his hand, and Joshua said unto him, art thou for us or for our
Adversaries? And he said, Nay, but as Captain of the Host of the Lord an I now
come, Josh. 5. 13, 14.

6. As the Lord of Hosts, as a General with his Armies. The Lord of Hosts is
with us, Psalm. 46. 7. The Lord of Armies, of all the Armies of Heaven and
Earth, and Hell too. Devils are subject unto him, Luke 10. 17. The Devil could
do nothing against Job, till he had commission from this Lord of Hosts, Job. 1.
12. and 2. 6. A Legion of Devils could not resist Christ's word of Command,
Mark. 5. 8, 9. nor could they enter into the Swine without commission, v. 12,
13. O for faith to believe what we read and hear^ What do we lose for want of
the exercise of faith. You have it may be the habit of faith, but if it comes
not forth into act, you have no the Comfort of it.

7. If God be with us, He is with us as a King with his Subjects. Number. 23. 21.
The shout of a King is among them: He is styled the King of Jacob, Isa. 41. 21.
The King of Israel, Isa. 44. 6. and the King of Saints, Rev. 15. 3. And this
King is a great King, Mal. 1. 14. An everlasting King, Jer. 10. 10. and King of
Kings, Rev. 19. 16. and Prince of the Kings of the Earth, Rev. 1. 5. By whom
Kings Reign, and in whose hand is their breath and life. Now to have God with
us as a Father, as a Husband, as a Friend, as a Shepherd, as a Captain, as a
Lord of Hosts, and as a King of Kings, must needs be a great privilege.

8. Once more, if God be with us, He is with us as God in Covenant with us, to
do all that for us which belongs to a God in Covenant to do. The Lord his God
is with him, Number. 23. 21. So The Lord our God is with us to help us. 2 Chronicles.
32. 8. How sweet and comfortable are these Monosyllables His, and Our. The Lord
His God, The Lord Our God is with us. That God with us, is a very great
privilege, will further appear, if we consider for what ends, intents and
purposes, he is presen.

For what ends I shall show you,

1. In general.

2. In particular.

1. In general, God is present with his people to bless them, Genesis 26. 24. I am
with thee said God to Isaac, and will bless thee. To deal well with them. God
tells Jacob that he would be with him, Genesis 31. 3. and afterward when Jacob
pleads this promise, he thus interprets it, O God of my Father Abraham, and God
of my Father Isaac, the Lord which said unto me, I will deal well with thee,
Genesis 32. 9. Now to have God with us, and to deal well with us, sure is no mean
privilege.

2. In particular, God is with his people for these gracious ends and purposes.

1. To hear their prayers. Notable is that place Deuteronomy. 4. 7. For what Nation is
there so great who has God so nigh them, as the Lord our God is, in all things
that we call upon him for. God is with us to hear our Prayers and Complaints,
to grant our suits, and to do whatsoever we shall according to his will desire
of him. 1 John 5. 14. What have you for God to do? God is ready to do it if you
desire it.

2. To guide and lead us. The Lord was with the people of Israel. Number. 14. 14.
and went before them by day in a Pillar of a Cloud to lead them the way, and by
night in a Pillar of Fire to give them light, to go by day and night. Exodus 13.
21. God is the same God that he was then, and his presence is as much with his
people now, as it was then, though he go not before them in such visible
Tokens, now, as then. I will, says God Psalm. 32. 8. Instruct th^e, and teach
thee in the way which thou shall go: I will guide thee. God is with us to
direct, and guide us, to show us the way and make it plain. All the journyings
of Isr^el were ordered by God. It Is very remarkable what you read concerning
their Travels, Number. 9. 17. to the end of the Chapter, according to the command
of God they journied, and rested.

3. God is with his people to give them rest. He knows they are in a World
full of Trouble, and that in the World they shall have Tribulation, and that
it cannot be avoided. Joh. 16. 33. He knows, that they will be injured,
oppressed, and persecuted, and therefore will be with them to give them rest.
My presence shall go with thee, said God to Moses Exodus 33. 14. and I will give
thee Rest. Now thou art Traveling, journying and wandering up and down, but I
will give thee rest.

4. To provide for them, to observe what they want, and to provide it; if they
want food, or water, to provide it; or if they want Raiment, to provide it. As
the Father is with his Children, and as the Nurse is with the Infant, so the
Lord is with his people. The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want, Psalm. 23.
1. He has pasture enough for his Sheep, He makes them lie down in green
Pastur^s, he leads them by the still waters: yea though I walk through the
Valley of the shadow of death, says David Psalm. 23. I will not fear, for thou
art with me. Sirs, who lays the Cloth, who spreads the Table, who sends in
provision? Thou preparest a Table before me, Psalm. 23. 6. God provides, and if
their be none else to do it, he can command Ravens to do it. See 1 Kings. 14.
4, 6. If provision cannot be had in an Ordinary, he will send it in an
extraordinary way. He clave the Rock in the Wilderness, and gave them drink as
out of the great Depths. Psalm. 78. 15. He commanded the Clouds of the wind, and
gave them bread and flesh also. Psalm. 78. 23, 24, 26, 27. So that they lacked
nothing. Deuteronomy. 2. 7.

5. God is with his people to preserve them from Trouble, if it be best. But it
may be better to be in Trouble then out of it. A Prison may be better then a
Palace, Restraint may be better then Liberty, Sickness better then Health, and
Poverty better then Plenty. Prosperity may s^ay, Pro. 1. 32. Adversity may
profit. Heb. 12. 10. And preserve. The Lord is with us to deliver from trouble,
if it be best to be preserved from it. The Lord is in the midst of his people,
Psalm. 46. 5. therefore they shall not be moved. Surely there is no enchantment
against Jacob, there is no Divination against Israel. Number. 23. 23. I am with
thee, says God to Paul, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee, Act. 18.
10. As birds flying, so will the Lord of Hosts defend Jerusalem, defending also
he will deliver it, and passing over he will preserve it. Isa. 41. 5. What
shall we say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us? Romans 8.
31. If evil be coming, he prevents it. G^deon thought if God had been with them
evil could have not befallen them. O my Lord, says he, If the Lord be with us,
why is all this be fallen us? Judge. 6. 13. We live in the midst of dangers, in
the midst of Snares, in every place evil attends us. Its a wonder that we are
preserved: If God were not with us, how much evil would daily befall us!

6. God is with his people to save from harm in trouble, if it come, to save
from burning in the Fire, and from drowning in the Water. Isa. 43. 2. Remember
Daniel saved from hurt in the Lions Den, and the Three Princes saved from hurt
in the Fiery-Furnace, and Jonah from hurt in the Whales Belly, because God was
with them.

7. God is with his people to disappoint enemies when they Associate
themselves, and take counsel together, laying their Heads together, and laying
their Counsels deep, that none may see them, yet then God is with his people to
blast the plots of their enemies. Isa. 8. 10. Associate your selves, and ye
shall be broken in pieces, take counsel together, and it shall come to naught,
speak the word, and it shall not stand, for God is with us.

8. God is with his people to overthrowtheir enemies when they pursue them, and
will not be stopped, when they take up Pharaoh-like Resolutions. Exodus 15. 9. The
enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil, my lust
shall be satisfied upon them, I will draw my Sword, and my hand shall destroy
them. Here was Resolution enough: But pray mark what follows, v. 10. Thou did
blow with thy wind, the Sea covered them, they sank as lead in the mighty
Waters. Thus the Lord overthrew them. Exodus 14. 27. I will be with thee, said
God to Gideon, Judge. 6. 16. And thou shall smite the Midianites as one man. So
God tells David 2 Samuel 7. 9. I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and
have cut off all thy enemies out of thy sight. What a promise is that, Isa. 59.
26. I will feed them that oppress thee, with their own flesh; and they shall be
drunken with their own blood, as with sweet Wine, and all flesh shall know that
I the Lord am with the^, thy Savior and thy Redeemer, the mighty one of Jacob.

9 The Lord is with his people to deliver them out of trouble in due time. Thus
God was with Jeremie when he sent him, and enemies threatened him, I will be
with thee, says the Lord, to deliver thee, Jer. 15. 20. We are troubled on
every side, says the Apostle, but not distressed; perplexed, but not in
despair; Persecuted, but not for saken. No, God was with them. 2 Cor. 4. 8, 9.

God was with Joseph and delivered him out of all his Afflictions, Act. 7. 9.
10. according to that promise, Psalm. 91. 15. I will be with him in trouble, and
deliver him.

10. God is with his people to assist and strengthen them in their work. Act.
10. 38. It is said, our Lord Jesus Christ went about doing good, the Lord being
with him. Fear not, says the Lord, Isa. 41. 10. for I am with thee, I will
strengthen thee, yea I will keep thee, yea I will uphold thee with the right
hand of my Righteousness. Again v. 13. I will help thee, and again, v. 14. I
will help thee.

11. The Lord is with his people to comfort them. Thy R^d and thy Staff they
comfort me. Gods Rod, like Aarons, blossometh, and like Jonathans has honey at
the end of it. Psalm. 43. 4. In all our Tribulation God is present to comfort
u^. 2 Cor. 1. 4. O for faith to believe it!

12. To Animate and hearten them against fears. Fear not, for I am with thee,
Isa. 41. 10. Fear not, when thou passest through the waters I will be with
thee, Isa. 43. 1, 2. Be strong and of good courage, said God to Joshua, for the
Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou go. Josh. 1. 9. Be strong O
Zerubbabel, says the Lord, and be strong O Joshua, and be strong all ye
people, says the Lord, and work, for I am with you the Lord of Hosts. Hag. 2.
4. Joshua and Caleb, to hearten and encourage the people, Number. 14. 9. to go up
against their enemies, thus bespeaks them, The Lord is with us, fear them not.
So Moses tells the same people, If thou shall say in thy heart, these Nations
are more then I, how can I dispossess them? Deuteronomy. 7. 17. Thou shall not be
affrighted at them, says he v. 21. For the Lord thy God is among you, a mighty
God and terrible. And again, Deuteronomy. 20. 1. When thou go out to Battle against
thine enemies, and see Horses and Chariots and a People more then thou, be
not afraid of them, for the Lord thy God is with thee, which brought thee out
of the Land of Egypt. Once more Moses encourages the people and Joshua. Deuteronomy.
31. 6, 8. The Lord, he it is that does go before thee, he will be with thee, he
will not fail thee nor for sake thee, fear not, neither be dismayed.

13. God is with his people sometimes to make them greater and greater, as he
was with David. 1 Chronicles. 11. 9. So David waxed greater and greater; for the
Lord of Hosts was with him. But what if we wax not greater and greater in the
World, if we wax greater and greater in Goodness, in knowledge, faith and other
graces, will it not be much better? and this we shall do if God be with us.

14. God is with his people to Correct them. But you will say perhaps, Is it a
privilege to be corrected? A greater privilege it may be then all the rest.
Sirs, such is our State here that we need correction: We are Sanctified but in
part. We have Dross, and Dirt, and Rust, and Filth in and about us, God
knows. If you had no Dross, you would need no Fire. If you had no Dirt, you
would need no washing. If no Rust, you would need no File, and if no Chaff you
would need no Flail. If no Folly, you would need no Rod. But seeing you have
Dross, Dirt, Rust and Chaff not a little, Is it not best for the Gold to be
refined, and best for the Dirt and Filth to be washed out, and for the Chaff to
be fanned away, and for the Rust to be scoured off? And if so, is i^ not a
privilege to be Corrected? Correction is our melting, washing, fanning,
^iling. If the Child offend in the Fathers ^bsence, he scapes a scouring; but
if the Father be at home he will not think to escape so. If we offend, and be
faulty, God is with us to Correct us. And he will correct; yet as a Father, in
measure; He will stay his rough Wind in the day of his East Wind. Isa. 27. 8.
Fear thou not O Jacob my servant, says the Lord, for I am with thee, I will
not make a full end of thee, as of others, but correct thee in measure, yet
will I not leave thee wholly unpunished. Jer. 46. 28. and 30. 11. David blessed
God for his Correction. Before I was afflicted I went astray, but now have I
kept thy word, Psalm. 119. 67. and v. 71. It is good for me that I have been
afflicted, that I might learn thy Statutes. and v. 75. I know O Lord that thy
Judgments are righ^, and that thou in faithfulness have afflicted me.

15. God is with his people to incline their hearts to himself to walk in his
ways. 1 King. 8. 57, 58. The Lord our God is with us; let him not leave us,
nor forsake us, that we may incline our hearts unto him to walk in all his
ways, and to keep his commandments.

16. To enable them to finish work begun. The Lord God, even my God will be
with thee, said David to his Son Solomon, he will not fail thee nor forsake
thee, un^il thou have finished all the work for the service of the house of the
Lord. 1 Chronicles. 28. 20.

17. To give wisdom and understanding. David prays, The Lord be with thee my
Son, and give wisdom and understanding, 1 Chronicles. 22. 11, 12. and to give him a
wise behavior, David behaved himself wisely in all his ways, and the Lord was
with him. 1 Samuel 18. 14.

18. God is with his people to effect difficult undertakings. Moses thought
that going to Pharaoh, and bringing the Children of Israel out of Egypt, was a
work too great and difficult for him, and therefore desired to be excused,
saying, who am I that I should take such a work in hand. Exodus 3. 11. I am not
eloquent, I am of slow speech, and of a slow tongue, Exodus 4. 10. It Is no matter
for that says God; go and I will be with thy mouth, and I will teach ^hee what
thou shall say, Exodus 4. 12. Certainly I will be with thee, Exodus 3. 12. And
thou shall bring them out of Egypt. And Joshua should bring them into Canaan,
as hard a work as it was, for God will be with him. Deuteronomy. 31. 23.

19. To hold them. I am continually with thee, thou have holden me by thy right
hand, Psalm. 73. 23. thou have holden me fast, so Ainsworth, and kept me from
falling, so Isa. 41. 10. I am with thee, I will uphold thee with the right hand
of my righteousness. God is with us to hold us by our right hand with his right
hand; this is a great privilege, seeing God is greater then all, and none is
able to pluck them out of his hand. Joh. 10. 29. He is with us to keep us by
his Power through faith unto salvation, 1 Pet. 1. 5.

20. God is with his people to separate them and others. Exodus 33. 16. To make
a difference between them that serve him, and them that serve him not. Mal. 3.
18. and 4. 1. 2, 3. See an instance, Dan. 3. 22, 23. In those that were cast
into the fiery Furnace, and those that cast them in. See also to this purpose,
Exodus 11. 7. and. 10. 23. and. 9. 26. and. 8. 22. 23.

When some are separated to evil, Deuteronomy. 29. 21. God is with his people to
separate them unto good.

3. I come now to the third General, to show that this privilege of Gods
gracious presence is much to be desired and prayed for.

Paul desired it for these Thessalonians. 2 These. 3. 16 And for Timothy, 2 Timothy
4. 22.

Moses desired it for himself, and the people, Exodus 13. 15. and. 34. 9. If I
have found grace in thy sight, O Lord, let my Lord I pray thee go amongst us.

So did Jabez, 2 Chronicles. 4. 10. Jabez called on God saying, Oh that thou would
bless me, and that thine hand might be with me.

David also desired it for Solomon. 1 Chronicles. 22. 11, 16. My Son, the Lord be
with thee. v. 11. Arise and be doing, and the Lord be with thee, v. 16.

Jonathan also prays thus for David. The Lord be with thee, 1 Samuel 20. 12.

And thus prays Solomon for himself, and for his people, 1 King. 8. 57. The
Lord our God be with us, let him not leave us, nor forsake us, that we may
incline our ^earts unto him to walk in all his ways.

4. Now for the ground and reasons of this Doctrine, why Gods presence is so
much to be desired and prayed for.

1. Rea. Because God is so excellent and admirable in all Perfections. There is
nothing wanting in God, God is All. How excellent is that name of his, Exodus
34. 6. The Lord, the Lord God, Merciful and Gracious, long suffering, and
abundant in goodness and truth; keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving
iniquity, transgression and sin. Again Mic. 7. 18. Who is a God like unto thee
that pardons iniquity, and passes by the transgression of the remnant of his
heritage: he retains not his anger for ever, because he delights in mercy.

2. Rea. Because he is so suitable to our condition, therefore is his presence
so much to be desired. We are in misery, we are unworthy, we are weak, and yet
provoking; And does God suit with such? with such as are in misery? yes, for he
is merciful: and with such as are unworthy? yes, for he is gracious: and with
the weak? yes, for he is strong. Does he suit with such as are provoking too?
yes, for he is long suffering, and with backslider^? yes, for he is a God that
heals backslidings. And does he suit with such as have neither money nor
price? yes, He will love them freely. Surely mercy and misery do well agree,
and so does graciousness and unworthiness, strength and weakness. Now hence it
is, because no person or thing in all the World suits so well with our
condition as God does, that his presence is so much to be desired and prayed
for.

3. Rea. Because God is so useful for us, therefore his presence is so much to
be desired. What say you to a portion, is not that of use? What say you to an
Inheritance, is not that of use? What say you to the Light, is not that of
use? What say you to a shield in Battle, is not that of use? What say you to
a shelter in a Storm (...) not that of use? What say you to a Refuge, a Rock,
a Tower, when you are pursued, is not that of use? God is all this: The Lord is
my Portion says my soul, Lam. 3. 24. The Lora is their Inheritance. Ezekiel. 44.
28. Psalm. 16. 5. The Lord is my Light. Psalm. 27. 1. The Lord is a Sun and a
Shield. Psalm. 84. 11. The God of Jacob is ou^ Refuge. Psalm. 46. 11. The Lord is
my Rock, my fortress, and my deliverer, my God, my Strength in whom I will
trust, my Buckler, the horn of my salvation, and my high Tower. Psalm. 18. 2.
Now, no wonder, the presence of God is so desirable, because he is so excellent
and so suitable a good and so useful for us.

4. Rea. Because God is so lasting a good. There are many things that may (...)
well with us, and be very useful to us, but they may be of little continuance,
they may he short lived. Husbands and Wives whom God has so suited, that none
could possibly be suited better must part. Husbands do not live for ever with
their Wives, and Parents do not live for ever with their Children, nor one
friend with another. But God is a lasting good. The everlasti(...)g God. Isa.
40. 28. Have thou not known, have thou not heard, (...)at the everlasting God,
the Lord, the Creator of the e^ds of the Earth faints not, neither is weary.

5. Reas. Because all other good will do us no good without him. The Creature,
nay all the Creatures are but Ciphers without him. The Creature is not Bread,
you mistake if you think so, why do you spend money for that which is not
Bread, and your labor for that which satisfies not? ^sa. 55. 2.

The Creatures name is vanity, vanity of vanities, says the Preacher, vanity
of vanities, all is vanity. Eccles. 1. 2. The (...) is a thing of naught. Amos.
6. 13(...) It is not. Prove. 23. 5. Will thou (...) thine eyes upon that which
is not. Sirs, how many things is there, that have been in your possession, of
which you must now say they are not: My Wife is not, my Husband is not, my
Father is not, my Mother is not. But will it ever be said God is not? Christ is
not? The Holy Spirit is not? No, no. Hence it is also that the presence of God
is so much to be desired above all other things; because all other things will
do us no good without him. Jehosaphat a Prince, a potent Prince, whose Militia
was Eleven hundred and threescore thousand, besides what he had in Garrisons, 2 Chronicles. 17. 12, etc. It Is said, he waxed great exceedingly; yet says he, 2 Chronicles. 20. 12. We have no might, neither know we what to do. but our eyes are
unto thee. This he speaks in reference to God, without whom indeed they had no
might at all. He looked upon all the Forces he had, as nothing without God. And
so are Riches, and so are Relations: Alas! they are nothing without God.

Reas. 6 Because God alone is enough, he is enough without any thing else. God
needs not the Creature to supply us, to support us, to refresh, revive and
comfort us; He needs not the Creature to direct or counsel us. It pleases him
to make use of the Creature, and to afford it most times; but if he deny it, he
can do it without the Creature. It was an excellent saying of that Martyr, If
you take away my food, God will t(...)e away my hunger. Truly Sirs God has
made a little serve the turn many times, when others with their much have been
in want. In the midst of their sufficiency they have been in straights, Job 20.
22. Remember that of Habakkuk, I wish the same frame of heart to you that he
had, Habak. 3. 17, 18. Although the fig^ree shall not blossom, neither shall
fruit be in the vines; the labor of the olive shall fail; and the fields shall
yield no meat, the slock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no
heard in the stalls: (How then would he be able to live!) yet I will rejoice in
the Lord, I will joy in the God of my salvation. When there is no meat in the
fields or stalls; there is yet a God in Heaven: and he knows how it is with us,
and that we have need of these things, Matthew. 6. 32. and if the Father know
that his child wants bread, he shall not want it long, if his Father be able to
relieve him; what ever you want, if you want not faith, it will be well enough:
O for the skill of living by faith! It is nothing with thee to help, says Asa,
in his prayer to God, whether with many, or with them that have no power: 2 Chronicles. 14. 11. God with us is more then all besides, 2 Chronicles. 32. 7, 8. I come
now to the Application, If the Gracious presence of God be so grea a
privilege, and therefore so much to be desired. Then hence be Informed,



1. Happy are they that have God graciously present with them. Take your Bible
and read, Deuteronomy. 4. 7. and 33. 29. 2 Samuel 7. 23. Lev. 26. 11, 12. Happy the
Congregations and Habitations that have this Name, The Lord is there, Ezekiel. 48.
35. and that may be called the Throne of God, Jer. 3. 17. This is matter of
rejoicing, Sing and rejoice O daughters of Zion, for lo I come, and I will
dwell in the midst of thee, says the Lord, Zech. 2. 10, 11. See also Rev. 21.
3.

2. Miserable are they with whom God is not, that want his gracious presence.
How was Saul distressed for want of Gods presence, 1 Samuel 28. 15, 16. Woe, woe to
such from whom God departs, Hos. 9. 12.

Use 2. Is God with us so great a privilege, and so much to be desired? Then
examine, Is God with us? Are we privileged with his presence? To know, take
these signs of Gods gracious presence.

First, A praying frame of heart is a sign of Gods favorable presence. God is
a God hearing Prayer, Psalm. 65. 2. and prepares the heart to pray where ever he
is, Psalm. 10. 17. and pour's out a spirit of prayer, Z^ch. 12. 10. Jerem. 31.
9. which spirit helps our Infirmities, and prays in us, Romans 8. 26. God sets
them with whom he is, a praying.

1. In all places, in the closet and family, yea and in the field, Ruth 2. 4.
The Lord be with you, said Boaz, to his Reapers in the field.

2. At all times, in the Evening and Morning, at Noon, and at Midnight, Psalm.
55. 17. and 119. 62. God was with Moses, David and Daniel, and they pray; with
Jabez, and he prays; 1 Chronicles. 4. 10. with Ephraim, Jerem. 31. 18. and he
prays; with Paul, and he prays; Act. 9. 11. and when with us, we shall pray
also; Psalm. 91. 15.

Secondly, A penitent frame of heart; where God is, there is weeping and
mourning for sinning against him. How were Joseph's guilty brethren troubled at
h(...) presence, Genesis 45. 3. So shall guilty w^ be at the presence of God, we
shall lo^k on him whom we have pierced, and mou^^; Z^ch. 12. 10. and J^r. 31.
9, 18, 19. where you have an instance of a mourning frame of heart, when God
vouchsafed his presence.

Thirdly, An humble frame of heart; God dwells with such, and none but such,
sa. 57. 15.

Fourthly, An obedient frame of heart inclined to God, to walk in all his
ways. If the Lord our God be with us, he will incli^e our hearts to keep his
Testimonies, 1 Kings 8. 57, 58. Where he comes, he puts his spirit into them,
and causes them to walk in his Statutes, Ezekiel. 36. 27. See Joh. 8. 29.

Fifthly, Strength in the Soul, Psalm. 138. 3. whom God is with, he strengthens;
Isa. 41. 10. both to do and suffer; to do business, and bear burdens, Psalm 55.
22.

Sixthly, Warm affections, heat and life in the service of God; whilst Christ
was with, and talked with his Disciples, their hearts burned within them, Luke
24. 32.

Seventhly, A spirit stirred up to promote the worship, and service of God. I
am with you says the Lord, Hag. 1. 13. And the Lord stirred up their spirits,
and they came and did work in the house of the Lord of hosts their God, v. 14.

Eighthly, Preservation from evil, from the evil of sin especially. Oh that
thou would be with me, and keep me from evil; was the request of Jabez, 1
Chr^. 4. 10. where God is he delivers from every evil work, 1 Timothy 4. 18.

Ninthly, Victory over enemies; Surely, I will be with thee, says God to
Gideon, Judge. 6. 16. and thou shall smite the Midianites as one man. If God be
with us, enemies will be subdued, 1 Chronicles. 22. 18. world f^esh and Devil too
will be subdued; Through the spirit, the deeds of the flesh will be mortif^^d,
Romans 8. 13.

Tenthly, Profiting by afflictions, H^b* 12. 10.

Eleventhly, Fruitfulness, under means of grace: If the spirit come and blow
upon our garden, the spices thereof will flow out; Cant. 4. 16. If Christ be in
us, and abide in us, we shall bring forth much fruit, Joh. 15. 5.

Twelfthly, Fixedness, unmoveableness from God, and his truth: God is in the
midst of her, she shall not be moved; Psalm. 46. 5. Because he is at my right
hand, I shall not be moved; Psalm. 16. 8. Because he is with us, the Gates of
Hell shall never prevail against us. Christ our Sampson (as one says) has
flung them off their Hinges. We shall not be greatly moved, Psalm. 62. 2.

Use 3. Of Exhortation. Sirs, get God to be with you. Gods gracious Presence is
the principal thing, therefore with all thy getting, get it. Gold in the purse
or coffer will not stead or avail you, like God with you. God answers more then
money. Wealth when gotten, moth and rust may corrupt it, Thieves may break
through and steal it. But God is out of the reach of all, there is no fear or
danger of loosing him, when once you have gotten him: He therefore is worth the
getting. Some have found by experience that such and such things have not been
worth their getting, not worth their sitting up late, and rising betimes for
them, not worth their running and riding and venturing for them. How earnest
have some been to be possessed of, and to enjoy such and such persons and
things, and having obtained them, have they not found them by wofui experience,
not worth the cost and pains laid out for them? But God will over and above
make amends for what is laid out for him. A shadow is not worth the following,
but substance is. Chaff is not worth heaping up, but Corn is. Dross is not
worth the seeking, but Gold is, and God much more then Gold. And farther, you
may seek the Creature, and never be able to get it: You may seek, and not find:
You may wish, O that I had wealth, and yet never have it, and O that I had
credit and repute in the World, and possibly never have it. But who ever sought
God and found him not? who ever sought the presence of God; and was denied it?
shall any Soul, ever have cause to say, Lord I did desire thy presence, but
could not have it; I did choose to have thee with me, rather then to have all
the World with me, and yet I could not have thee with me? Do you think there
will ever be cause for such a Reflection upon God, the God of love? shall it
ever be said, this poor Soul would have had the presence of God, but God would
not afford it? O no! shall any person be ever able to say, I would have had God
to be my God, and to be with me as a Father, Friend, and Husband, but he would
not? or shall ever any person be able to say, I would have had Jesus Christ, to
be with me as a Prophet, Priest and King, but he would not? I would have had
him to be my mediator, Advocate, Surety and Savior, but he would not; I would
have had his righteousness imputed to me, and his Spirit imparted to me, but
could not have it? or shall any person be ever able to say, I would have had
the holy Spirit to be with me, to convince me of my sin and misery, to
enlighten me in the knowledge of Christ and to renew my will, and to persuade
and enable me to embrace Christ Jesus freely offered to me, but he would not be
with me to do any of those things for me; no, for then how should God be the
faithful God, as he is styled, Deuteronomy. 7. 9. Isa. 49. 7. 1 Cor. 1. 9. and. 10.
13. 2 These. 3. 3. 2 Timothy 2. 13. Heb. 10. 23. and. 11. 11. And a faithful
Creator, 1 Pet. 4. 19. If we confess our sins he is faithful (because he has
promised) to forgive them 1 John 1. 9. So if we ask, seek and knock, he is
faithful to give, to be found, and to open: If we desire his presence, he is
faithful to afford it. He that has promised, Jer. 29. 13. that we shall find
him when we shall search for him with all our heart, is faithful to perform it.

And how should Jesus Christ be a merciful and faithful high Priest? as he is
styled. Heb. 2. 17. And how should the holy Ghost be the Spirit of truth? as he
is called, Joh. 14. 17. But I fear God will have cause to say of many, I would
have been with you, but you regarded not my presence; you said to me depart,
Joh. 21. 14. I would have been your God, but you would none of me, Psalm. 8^.
11. I would have been your Portion, but you made light of me; I would have been
a Father and a Friend to you, and a Husband too, but you would not carry your
selves like Children to me, nor friendly to me, nor Spouse-ike to me.

And Christ I fear, will have cause to say of many, I would have been with you
as a prophet to teach you, but you desired not the knowledge of my ways. Joh.
21. 14. I would have been with you as a Priest to have offered (...) incense
with your Prayers, and to have made your spiritual sacrifices acceptable to
God, but you would not yray, nor offer up any spiritual sacrifice unto God: You
would not come unto me, Joh. 5. 40. nor unto God by me. I would have covered
you with my righteousness, but you would not put it on; you went about to
establish your own righteousness, and would not submit to Gods, Romans 10. 3. I
would have given my spirit, but you would not receive it, you would needs
quench, grieve, and resist it. Act. 7. 51. I would have been with you as a
King, but you would not that I should Reign over you, Luke 19. 14. And the Holy
Spirit I fear will have cause to say, I would have convinced you of sin and
misery, but you would not see, but would flatter your selves, that you were
rich and increased with goods and wanted nothing, Rev. 3. 17. I would have
enlightened your minds in the knowledge of Christ, and you shut your eyes, and
loved darkness rather then light, Joh. 3. 19. I would have renewed your wills,
but you would have your own wills, and would choose your own ways, Isa. 66. 3.
and delight in your Abominations. I would have persuaded you to embrace Christ
Jesus freely offered to you in the Gospel, but you would not receive him, Joh.
1. 15. I would have persuaded you to rejoice in Christ Jesus, but you would
rejoice in a thing of naught, Amos 6 13.

What further shall I say to move and persuade you to get God to be with you;
to get God the Father, and God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost to be with you?
(for there is a presence of each; Of the Father, 2 Cor. 6. 16. John 14. 23. Of
the Son, Matthew. 28. 20. John 14. 23. And of the Holy Ghost, John 14. 6, 17.)

1. Enemies will be with you whether you will or no: You have many enemies, and
therefore need one friend. Do not think your warfare will be at an end while
you live here. Assure your selves you will be set upon, and if you have not a
God with you, you will certainly be overcome, you will be snared and taken, and
carried away captive.

First, The Devil is with you, and he is with you as a roaring Lion, 1 Pet. 5.
18. ready to tear you in pieces, and none but God can deliver you: What will
you do when the Devil is with you, if God be not with you to help you? Whither
will the Devil drive you, if God do not stop him? If God do not stand in the
way, and hedge up the way with thorns? How did the Swine run when the Devil
did enter into them, they stopped not till they were choked and drowned in the
Sea. What work will the Devil make, if God be not with us to deliver us? What
work did he make with our first Parents, Genesis 3. 1. and with David, 1 Chronicles.
21. 1. and with Judas, John 13. 2, 27. Such work will he make with us if God be
not with us. Therefore what ever you do, get God to be with you:

Secondly, The world is with you, and it is a bewitching, ensnaring, and
mischeiving world? They that follow after mischief, draw nigh, Psalm. 119. 150.
and when they draw nigh, what will you do if God be not nigh too. The world was
with Demas, and for want of Gods presence with him, what work it made with him
you may see, 2 Timothy 4. 10. It made him apostatize. It was also with the young
man in the Gospel, and what work it made with him, see, Matthew. 19. 22. It made
him turn his back upon Christ and eternal life. It was with Gehazi, and what
work it made with him, see 2 King. 5. 22. It made him tell lie upon lie: and
all this for want of Gods presence with them. The world with its three great
Commanders, the lust of the eye, the lust of the flesh, and the pride of life,
was with Joseph, and Moses; and set upon them, but could not harm them, because
God was with them. The lust of the flesh, viz. carnal pleasure, could not harm
Joseph because God was with them, Genesis 39. 8, 9. The lust of the eye, and the
pride of life, could not harm Moses, because God was with him, (...) Heb. 11.
24, 25, 26, 27.

Thirdly, Corrupt nature, that great evil is always present with you, Romans 7.
21. World and Devil could not harm us were it not for this. This made Paul cry
out, Oh wretched man, Romans 7. 24. Had it not been for Jesus Christ, he had been
overcome by it.

2. Motive, God is ready at a call to be with you, Psalm. 50. 15. Call upon me
and I will deliver thee. As ready to be with you, as Jonathan's Armor-bearer
was to be with him, 1 Samuel 14. 7. Behold, says he to Jonathan, I am with thee
according to thy heart: So will God say much more, if thou desire it, Behold I
am with thee according to thy hearts desire; As ready to be with you in your
war with the world, sin and the Devil, as ever Jehosaphat was to be with Ahab
in his war* with the King of Syria: I am as thou art, said Jehosaphat to Ahab,
and I will be with thee in the war, 2 Chronicles. 18. 3. So will God say to thee, if
thou say to hi, as Ahab said to Jehosaphat; will thou go with me to Ramoth
Gilead? So if thou say to God, Lord will thou go with me against the world,
flesh, and Devil. The Lord will answer, I am as thou art in this matter, and I
will be with thee in this war; and if he be with us* he will go forth as a
mighty man, he will stir up jealousy like a man of war, he will cry yea roar,
he will prevail against his enemies, Isa. 42. 13. And as ready as the people
were to be with Ezra in the Reformation; Arise, say they to him, be of good
courage and do it, Ezr. 10. 4. we also will be with thee. So says God to you,
Arise, Resist the Devil; 1 Pe^. 5. 9. S^rive against sin, Heb. 12. 4. Be of
good courage and do it, I also will be with you. This readiness of God to be
with you, methinks should strongly persuade you to desire and endeavor his
presence.

Motive 3. Lovers and friends may be far off; My lovers and my friends stand
^^oof off from my sore, and my kinsmen stand a far off, Psalm. 38. 11. I looked
on my right hand, and behold there was no man that would know me; Refuge failed
me, no man cared for my soul, Psalm. 142. 4. No man stood with me, but all men
forsook me, said Paul; 2 Timothy 4. 16. Now sirs, when all shall forsake you, if
you shall not be able to say with Paul, the Lord stands by me, what will you
do? So when Refuge shall fail you, if you shall not be able to say with David,
The Lord is my Refuge, Psalm. 142. 5. what will you do?

Motive 4. In the absence or want of some Creatures, you comfort your selves
with the presence of others. You comfort your selves with the presence of
friends and relations in the want of other things; and you say, though this be
gone, and that be gone, though this be lost, and that be lost and taken away,
yet my Husband is with me, or my Father is with me, or my Brother and Sister
are with me. Thus you comfort your selves in the want of some things, with the
presence of some other. How much more will it be a comfort to be able to say,
Though this and that be wanting, yet God is with me; Though Father and Mother
be not with me, yet God is with me; Though Brother and Sister be gone from me,
yet God is with me. This, this will be the comfort.

Motive 5. Nothing will be done acceptably without this gracious presence of
God, Joh. 15. 5. No duty or service that you can perform.

Motive 6. Nothing will succeed and prosper well without it, neither Temporals
nor Spirituals, but all prospers with it. 1. Temporals, see an instance in
Potiphars Possessions, what he had in his house, in his field; all prospered
upon the account of God's presence with Joseph, Genesis 39. 2, 3, 5. Another
instance you have in Labans goods, Gods promise to be with Jacob, see Genesis 28.
15. I am with thee, I will not leave thee. Now Laban says, Genesis 30. 27. I have
learned by experience, that the Lord has blessed me for thy sake. God with us
makes all to prosper, Deuteronomy. 2. 7. The Lord thy God has blessed thee in all the
works of thy hands, these forty years the Lord thy God has been with thee,
thou have lacked nothing. Go, do all that is in thy heart, said Nathan to
David, 2 Samuel 7. 3. For the Lord is with thee, q. d. Go and prosper for the
Lord is with thee.

Motive 7. God with us will make men afraid of us, and willing to comply and be
at peace with us: We read 1 Samuel 18. 12. that Saul was afraid of David,
because the Lord was with him. Abimilech, Ahuzza, and Phicol, come to Isaac,
and desire to make a league, agreement, and covenant with him; and they render
this as the Reason, We saw certainly that the Lord was with thee, 1 Samuel 26.
28. See also Isa. 45. 14.

Motive 8. God with us makes enemies and opposers to fall before us, Josh. 1.
5. There shall not any man be able to stand before thee; I will be with thee.

Motive 9. God with us makes others to fall to us. When Israel saw that God was
with Asa, they fell to him in great abundance 2 Chronicles. 15. 9.

Quest. But what is to be done that we may have God to be with us? What
direction can you give us?

Answ. Take these.

1. Pray the Lord earnestly to be with you. Pray as Solomon, 1 King. 8. 57. The
Lord our God be with us, let him not leave us nor forsake us: and as Jeremiah
in the name of the Church, Jer. 14. 9. We are called by thy name, leave us not.
And as the Apostle in the Text, The Lord be with you; So do you pray for your
selves, The Lord be with me. When you go about any Natural, Civil, or Religious
action, say, The Lord be with me. When you go to your Table, there is a snare;
and when to the Shop, there is a snare; and when to your Beds, there is a snare;
therefore whenever you go to your Table, Shop, or Bed, pray, The Lord be with
me. There are snares every where, and therefore every where you have need to
pray, The Lord be with me. Desire Gods presence, and you shall not be denied
it. Name the Person if you can that ever was denied Gods presence, if he prayed
for it? It Is true, God may seem to be absent, but he is really present with
his, when seemingly absent: He is but behind the curtain, on the other side of
the wall. How near may the Mother be, when the Child thinks her lost, and falls
a crying? And all this while the Mother is but in the next room. Thus it is
between God and his People; Christ withdraws from his Spouse, yet is really
present; for by virtue of his presence she seeks after him till she has found
him; if he had not been present, she could not have sought him: for if he draw
not, there is no running after him. Draw me, and we will run after thee, Cant.
1. 4. Pray then for the presence of God, let God see that you will not be
satisfied without him: How unsatisfied are some without Persons and Things?
They must enjoy such a Person, such a Thing, or they cannot be satisfied: They
cannot live, they shall dye without them. Let God see that you cannot live
without his presence. If you long for it, you shall not long be without it.

2. Hearken to the voice of them, that give you Counsel for your real good.
Hearken unto my voice, said Jethro to Moses, Exodus 18. 19. I will give thee
Counsel, and God shall be with thee. Be instructed, says God, Jer. 6. 8. Least
my Soul depart from thee.

3. Be with God. If you be with him, he will not fail to draw nigh to you: Draw
nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you, Jam. 4. 8. The Lord is with you,
whilst you are with him, 2 Chronicles. 15. 2. Be much with God then. Be with him in
your thoughts: let your hearts and affections be with him. When you awake be
still with him, Psalm. 139. 18. When you arise, be with him; when you go to duty
be with him, and draw night to him with your hearts, as well as your lips. When
you go about your work and business, be with him; when you go forth, and when
you return, be still with him. Be with the Lord continually, set him at your
right hand, and fear not: you shall then find him with you, holding your right
hand, Psalm. 73. 23. Nevertheless, I am continually with thee, thou have holden
me by my right hand. When you eat, do not eat without thoughts of God that
feeds you; when you put on your Clothes, be not without thoughts of God that
Cloatheth you; when you are in company, and when you are alone, still be with
him. This is the way to have God be with you. Be much with God. You know, it is
no difficult thing to be with those that are a thousand miles from us. Cannot
the Wife be with her Husband in her affections and desires though he be beyond
the Sea? and cannot the Father be with the Child that is many miles distant
from him? And why cannot we be thus with God?

Be with God also in his Ordinances and appointments, In them he will meet you,
and speak unto you, Exodus 29. 42. and. 30. 36. There you shall find him, Prove.
8. 34, 35. Watch daily therefore at his Gates: Wait at the Posts of the Doors.
Whilst you are with him, he will be with you. Whilst you carry your selves, as
in his presence, fearing serving and honoring him, he will be with you. Well
then, be with God.

1. Wake with him, Psalm. 139. 8.

2. Walk with him, as Enoch and Noah did.

3. Work with him. It Is said that Jonathan wrought with God, 1 Samuel 14. 45.
And Ministers are workers together with God, 2 Cor. 6. 1. And all of us must
work with him: Work out your salvation with fear etc. for it is God that
works in you, to will and to do, Philip. 2. 12, 13. He works all our works
in us, Isa. 26. 12. Sit not still therefore when he works.

4 War with God, the Lamb wars, Rev. 17. 14. And they that are called and
chosen, and faithful, they war with him: they side with him, and take his part.
He that is not with me, is against me, says Christ Mat. 12. 30. With these
God will side, and will take part with them. Psalm. 118. 6, 7.

Direct. 4. Love God and keep his Commandments, and then I can promise you his
presence. Sirs, would you have his company, whom you have no love for? would
you have him, whom you do not love to come unto you? Love him, and he will
come, else he will be at a distance from you: and show your love to him by
keeping his Commandments, then he will come and make his abode with you, Joh.
14. 23. If a man love me, he will keep my words, and my Father will love him,
and we will come and make our abode with him. What a promise did God make to
Jeroboam by Abijah the Prophet, 1 King. 11, 38. If thou will hearken to all
that I command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do that which is right in
my sight, I will be with thee. He that fears God, and works Righteousness,
is accepted with him, Act. 10. 35 Such God will meet in grace and mercy, Isa.
64. 5. Jacob went on his way, the way that God had commanded him, and the
Angels of God met him, Genesis 32. 1.

Direct. 5. If you would have God to be with you, keep your selves Clean: Do
not defile and pollute your selves with sin, which is the greatest filthiness.
It is sin that sets God at a distance from you. It Is your iniquities that
separate between you and your God, Isa. 59. 2. Stand in awe therefore, and sin
not, Psalm. 4. 4. A Law was given, of Old, to Gods people, that when ever they
did ease themselves abroad they should turn about, and with a Paddle cover that
which came from them, that no filthiness might be seen among them, Deuteronomy. 23. 13
The Reason is given, v. 14. For the Lord thy God walks in the midst of the
Camp, therefore shall thy Camp be holy, that he see no unclean thing in thee,
and turn away from thee. This outward cleanness here required, was to teach
them their duty to God and their Neighbor. Chiefly to God, that in regard of
his presence among them, they ought to keep themselves clean from all spiritual
pollutions. Next to their Neighbor, that they ought to do nothing that might
offend or annoy him. Sirs, God is of purer eyes then to behold evil, and cannot
look upon iniquity without detestation, Habak. 1. 13. You your selves turn away
from filthy Creatures; and will not God much more turn away from filthy sinners?

When God sees filthy Pride, and filthy Lucre, filthy Ryoting, and filthy
Drunkenness, filthy Chambering, and filthy Wantonness, filthy Strife, and
filthy Envying, these works of Darkness, Romans 13. 12, 13. God he turns away;
For what communion has light with darkness? 2 Cor. 6. 14. God will not be with
us, unless we destroy sin, that accursed thing. See Josh. 7. 11, 12. The throne
of iniquity shall have no fellowship with him, Psalm. 94. 20. Let not sin be
with you; if you would have God to be with you, keep a strict watch against
sin. And when at any time you do sin, (for there is no man that sins not)
turn back and cover it, that God may not behold it: set faith and repentance a
work immediately, and cover thy sin with the righteousness of Christ, and the
waters of godly sorrow: Let faith in Jesus Christ, and repentance toward God
be thy paddle to cover that filthiness of sin which comes from thee: so shall
you have the presence of God with you.

Direct. 6. Please God. That Is the way to have God with you. He that has sent
me is with me (says our Savior) The Father has not left me alone, for I do
always those things that please him; John 8. 29. I do the works of him that
sent me; John 9. 4. I am ever about my Fathers business; Luke 2. 49. and
therefore the Father has not left me alone. Nor will he leave us alone, but
will be nigh unto us in all that we call upon him for; if we do those things
that are pleasing in his sight; 1 John 3. 22.

Quest. How shall we do to please God?

Answ. Get out of the flesh; for we are in it, Romans 7. 5. as a man in the water
covered over head and ears with it; or as a man in bonds, Act. 8. 23. and
snares, 2 Timothy 2. 26. fast bound and hamperd in them. Now they that are in the
flesh cannot please God. Romans 8. 8. They that are in their natural estate,
still remaining such as they were by Adams fall, and such as they were born
into the World, without any change of Nature, Heart or Life, cannot please God.
If the Powers of their Souls and parts of their Bodies be still the same, if
their understandings be as dark as ever, if their wills be as stubborn as ever,
if their affections be as carnal and eart^ly as ever; If their Eyes, Ears,
Tongues, Hands, and Feet be as forward to sin as ever, they cannot please God:
If therefore you would please God, you must not rest satisfied in that Estate
wherein you were Born, and wherein you were Bred, and wherein you have Li^ed.
You must get out of the flesh, out of your Natural estate. You must be born
again, and be renewed. You must be quite another person, and be able to say, I
am not I. I was darkness, but now I am light in the Lord, Ephesians. 5. 8. I was
dead, but now I am quickened, Ephesians. 2. 1. I was such and such, but now I am
washed, 1 Cor. 6. 11. You must put off the Old man, and put on the new, Ephesians.
4. 22, 23. You must put off bad, and put on better, if you will please God,
Col. 3. 8, 9, 10. Old things must pass away, and all things must become new, 2
Cor. 5. 17. You must be new Creatures, else you cannot be God-pleasers.

2. Get into Christ. We are accepted only in the beloved, Ephesians. 1. 6. It Is in
Christ that God is pleased with any, Mat. 3. 17. Accept of Christ for your
Prophet, Priest and King* and God will accept of you for his Children, Spouse,
Friends.

Direct. 3. Prize Christ and use him.

1. Prize Christ. Leave all and cleave to him, See Psalm. 45. 10, 11. Christ's
Spouse must shave her head, pair her Nails, and bewail her Father and Mother:

1. Her Natural inbred evils and corruptions for Christ's sake, and then she
will please, See Deuteronomy. 21. 11, 12, 13. You must part with your Hair and Nails,
and Fathers House, if you will so please Christ as to be his Spouse. You must
rejoice in Christ, and have no confidence in the flesh, Phil. 3. 3. and say as,
Isa. 45. 24. In the Lord I have righteousness and strength, if you will please
God. Count all things but Loss and Dung in comparison of Christ. Phil. 3. 8. If
Christ be not precious in your Eyes, you will be but vile in Gods; but if
Christ be prized, God will be pleased. Sell all you have, and buy this Pearl.
Mat. 13. 46 This will please God.

2. Use Christ. It has pleased the Father, that in him all fullness should
dwell Col. 1. 19. for our use. that of his fullness we might receive what we
want, Job. 1. 16. Seeing God has made Christ for use, you cannot please God
unless you make use of Christ. The Ark by Noah was made for use, and so was the
Brazen Serpent by Moses; had neither been made use of, God would not have been
well pleased. To make use of Christ for the end and purposes for which God has
made him, is the way to please him. God has made Christ unto us Wisdom,
Righteousness, Sanctification, and Redemption, 1 Cor. 1. 30. Now to go to
Christ to be cured of our folly, to be cleared from our guilt, to be cleansed
from our filth, to be redeemed out of bondage, is the way to please God; but if
Christ be made light of, and not made use of, God will be displeased not a
little, Matthew. 22. 5, 7. Christ is meat and d(...)rk, John 6. 55. feed on him
by Faith; Christ is raiment, put him on, Romans 13. 14. Christ is the foundati^n,
1 Cor. 3. 11. build upon him; Christ is the Rock, 1 Cor. 10. 4. secure your
selves in the cles^s of it, Cant. 2. 14. Christ is the Fountain opened for sin,
and for uncleanness, Zech. 13. 1. wath your selves in it. Christ is the true
Light, John 8 12. come to it, and follow it. Christ is an Apple tree, Cant. 2.
3. sit under the shadow of it with delight, and eat of the fruit thereof. This
will please God to see his Son so much honored by being so much used, John 12.
26.

Direct. 4. Live by Faith, Habak. 2. 4. Walk by faith and not by sight, 2 Cor.
5. 7. Look to the things not seen, 2 Cor. 4. 18. This will please God. Enoch
had this Testimony, that he pleased God, Heb. 11. 5. and 'twas by faith, for
Heb. 11. 6. without faith it is impossible to please God. Act faith in the power
of God, as Abraham did, Romans 4. 21. Heb. 11. 19. and in the faithfulness of
God, as Sarah did, Heb. 11. 11. This will please God. Be fully persuaded that
what God has promised, he is able and faithful to perform; This will please
God. Trust in God at all times, Psalm. 62. 8. Cast your burden upon him, Psalm.
55. 22. Thy care on him, 1 Pet. 5. 7. Be careful for nothing, Phil. 4. 6. but
in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests
be made known to God; This will please God. See what a blessing God has
promised to such, Jer. 17. 7. 8.

Direct. 5. Labor to be like God and Christ, if you would please him: for
liking, is founded in likeness; and complacency, in conformity: What fellowship
has righteousness with unrighteousness? or what communion has light with
darkness? 2 Cor. 6. 14. Be ye holy as God is holy* 1 Pet. 1. 16. and merciful
as he is, Luke 6* 36.

Direct. 6. Be not like the world. Come out from among them, and I will receive
you, and be so well pleased with you, that I will be a Father to you, and you
shall be my sons and daughters, 2 Cor. 6. 17, 18. Come thou, and all thy house,
says God to Noah, Genesis 7. 1. into the Ark, I am well pleased with thee, and I
will take care of thee, and gives this for the Reason; For thee have I seen
righteous in this generation, called by St. Peter, The world of the ungodly, 2
Pet. 2. 5. This Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord, Genesis 6. 8. God saved
him, 2 Pet. 2. 5. To be blameless and harmless without rebuke, in the midst of
a crooked and perverse Nation; and to shine as lights among them, this will
please God, Phil. 2. 15. Walk not as other Gen^iles walk in the vanity of their
minds, Ephesians. 4. 17. Sleep not as do others, 1 These. 5. 6. Conform not to this
world, Romans 12. 2. Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness,
but rather reprove them, Ephesians. 5. 11. This will be acceptable to the Lord. What
care God took of Lot, who was righteous, in wicked Sodom, see Genesis 19. 16, 22.

Dir. 7. Be mourners for your own sins, and the sins of others. The sacrifices
of God are a broken spirit, wounded for sin; a broken and a contrite heart, O
God, thou will not despise, but accept, Psalm. 51. 17. God will restore comfort
to his mourners, Isa. 57. 18. These mourners in Zion, and for Zion, Isa. 61. 3.
and 66. 10. who mou^n for the desolation of Zion, and for their own sins and
the sins of others, as the procuring causes thereof, these are the persons that
please God, so that he takes double care of them in evil times, Ezekiel. 9. 4, 6*
and pronounces them blessed, and promises that they shall be comforted, Mat. 5.
4.

Dir. 8. Walk uprightly, order your conversation aright, without guile and
hypocrisy; in simplicity and godly sincerity have your conversations, doing
all your duties, to please God, and not for by-respects: With this God will be
so well pleased, that he will be to you a Sun and a Shield, that he will give
you Grace and Glory, that he will withold no good thing from you, Psalm. 84.
11. Prove. 2. 7. He will show you his salvation, Psalm. 50. 23. God will give him
a prospect of heaven here, and hereafter a full fruition of it; and no w^^der,
for you are his delight, Prove. 11. 20. Such as are upright in their way are his
delight: and what will not a man do for such in whom he delights? Read Esther
6. 6.

Dir. 9. Make the Christian Sabbath your delight; be glad and rejoice in it.
This will so please the Lord, that he will cause you to ride upon the high
places of the earth; yea, upon the heights of heaven, where thou shall keep an
everlasting Sabbath; and feed you with the heritage of Jacob your Father; not
only with the good things of the earthly Canaan, but with the good things of
the heavenly, of which the earthly was a type; with heavenly Manna, such food
as eye has not seen, ear heard, or mouth of natural man ever tasted. This you
may build upon, for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it, Isa. 58. 13, 14. If
you keep the Sabbath, and choose the things that please God, Isa. 56. 4. God
will be so well pleased, as to give you, 1. A place in his House: v. 5. And a
doorkeepers place in Gods house is worth the having, Psalm. 84. 10. A place in
Gods house, is that one thing which David was so earnest for, Psalm. 27. 4. 2. A
Name better then of sons and daughters of Princes; even prerogative royal, that
heavenly honor to be the sons and daughters of God, 2 Cor. 6. 18. John 1. 12.
And so to be called. 1 John 3 1. To have both the comfort and the credit of it;
for if sons, then heirs, Romans 8. 16, 17. 3. And make them joyful in his house
of Prayer, ver. 7. By their free access unto him, and good success in all their
suits. 4. And accept their sacrifices, ver. 7. Their sacrifices of Prayer,
Praise, Alms and Obedience, shall be accepted through Christ, who is the true
Altar that sanctifies all that is offered on it, Heb. 13. 10, 15. Rev. 3. 4.

Dir. 10. Watch at Wisdoms gates daily; wait at the posts of her doors, Prove.
8. 34, 35. And there you* shall find life, Isa. 55. 3. And obtain the favor of
God, which is better then life. There the Lord will meet you, and bless you,
Exodus 20. 24. There he will teach you, Isa. 2. 3. And there he will accept you,
Ezekiel. 20. 40. There you give him your loves, Cant. 7. 12. And there he will
give you his Loves. If he sup with you, you shall sup with him, Rev. 3. 20.
There you may get Faith more precious then Gold, Romans 10. 17. There you may
have a call to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ, 2 These. 2.
14.

Dir. 11. Pray continually. This pleases God. The prayer of the upright is his
delight, Prove. 15. 8. It Is sweet unto him, Cant. 2. 14. He will be nigh to them
that call upon him in truth, Psalm. 145. 18. Daniel's praying pleased God; as
appears by the event. Prayers come up for a me norial before God, Acts 10. 4.
God is so well pleased with prayer, that he will never turn it away, Psalm. 66.
20.

Dir. 12. Meditate on Gods Law day and night. Show thy love to God and it
thereby, as David did, Psalm. 119. 97. O how I love thy Law, it is my meditation
all the day. Let it be yours also, and God will make you like a tree planted by
the rivers of water, that brings forth his fruit in his season, and whose
leaf shall not wither, and whatsoever you do shall prosper, Psalm. 1. 2, 3.

Dir. 13. Worship God in spirit and in truth: Sure this is pleasing to him; for
the Father seeks such to worship him, Joh, 4. 23. He is greatly delighted
with such worship. God loves the gates of Zion more then all the dwellings of
Jacob, Psalm. 87. 2. The gates of Zion, the place of his worship, which he had
chosen to dwell in, more then all the Towns and Cities else which he had given
Jacob to dwell in. It Is not all worship that God is so delighted with; some
worship is an abomination to him. God complains of those that draw nigh to him
with their mouths, when their hearts are far from him, Isa. 29. 13. Mat. 15. 8.
It Is the heart God calls for, Prove. 23. 26. and truth in the inward parts, that
God desires, Psalm. 51. 6. It Is worship in spirit and truth that pleases God.

Dir. 14. Love God heartily, and seek him early. God loves them that love him,
Prove. 8. 17. and will show it, John 14. 21, 23. He that has my Commandments,
and keeps them, he it is that loves me; and he that loves me, shall be
loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest my self to him, and
we will come and make our abode with him. Obedience to this first and great
command of loving God, is more then all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices,
Mark 12. 33. Therefore for certain it pleases God. Delight thy self in the
Lord, and he will give thee the desires of thy heart, Psalm. 37. 4. And let the
desire of thy soul be to his name, and to the remembrance of him. With thy
spirit seek him early, Isa. 26. 8, 9. and he will be found of thee, Jer. 29. 13.

Dir. 15. Fear God greatly, as Obadiah did, 1 Kings 18. 3. On such the Sun of
righteousness will shine, Mal. 4. 2. The Lord will fulfill the desires of them
that fear him; he also will hear their cry, and will save them, Psalm. 145. 19.

Dir. 16. Choose to suffer rather then to sin. This was Moses's choice, Heb. 11.
25. rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, then to enjoy the
pleasures of sin for a season. This pleases God highly. Those three servants
of the most high God, Dan. 3. who did choose to burn to ashes, rather then to
bow to an Image, God was so well pleased with, that he restrained the fire from
burning of them. Daniel chooses to be torn to pieces, rather then not to pray,
Dan. 6. and God was so well pleased with his choice, that he shuts the mouths
of the Lions, that they hurt him not, v. 22. God also was so well' pleased with
the Martyrs choice of sufferings rather then of sinning, that he so wrought for
many of them; that they felt little or no pain. Baynam; one of our English
Martyrs, in the midst of flames, with arms and legs half consumed, uttered
these words; O ye Papists! behold, ye look for miracles; here now ye may see a
miracle: for in this fire I feel no more pain, then if I were in a Bed of Down;
but it is to me as a Bed of Roses.

Dir. 17. Get a meek and a quiet spirit: This is in the sight of God an
ornament of great price, 1 Pet. 3. 4. But a froward heart is an abomination to
God, Prove. 11. 20. Moses had this commendation, that he was very meek above all
the men which were upon the face of the earth, Numb. 12. 3. God takes his part,
and appears for him, Number. 12. 2, 4. Moses. is deaf and dumb, but God hears and
calls suddenly about the wrong done to Moses. And what a good end did God make
with patient Job? Jam. 5. 11.

Dir. 18. Be zealous, hot, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord, Romans 12. 11.
God cannot away with lukewarmness: lukewarm Laodicea he loathes, Rev. 3. 16. but
zealous Phineas he loves, Number. 25. 11, 12, 13. Psalm. 106. 30. Be fervent in
prayer, swift to hear, strict in the observation of the Sabbath; be strong in
faith, weep bitterly for sin. This heat in duty, will please God.

Do justly. This pleases God, Mic. 6. 8. more then thousands of Rams. To do
judgment and justice, to judge the cause of the poor and needy, is the way to
have it be well with us, Jer. 22. 15, 16. The just and rtghteous God hates
injustice, Zech. 8. 17. Doing justice and judgment, is the way of the Lord,
Genesis 18. 19. And sure he is well pleased with those that walk in his way.

Dir. 20. Love mercy. This also pleases God. To do good and communicate, forget
not; for with such sacrifice God is well pleased, Heb. 13. 16. It Is an odor of
a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well pleasing to God, Phil. 4. 18.
Christ is so well pleased with it, that he takes it as done to himself, Mat.
25. 34, 35, 36. And the contrary, showing no mercy, he takes so ill, that he
threatens, Jam. 2. 13. He shall have judgment without mercy, that has showed
no mercy.

Dir. 21. Walk humbly. To such an one God will look, Isa. 66. 2. yea, God will
dwell with the humble, and revive the humble, Isa. 57. 15. God resists the
proud, but gives grace to the humble, Jam. 4. 6. And if he give them grace,
sure he will give them glory.

Dir. 22. Be fruitful in every good work. This pleases God. The earth that
brings forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receives blessing from
God, Heb. 6. 7. I am come into my Garden, my Sister, my Spouse: Now there is
such pleasant fruit there, I cannot keep away. He is so well pleased with the
fruit he finds, that he gathers, eats and drinks, Cant. 5. 1.

A fruitful Vine pleases the Dresser.

A fruitful Tree the Planter.

A fruitful Field the Husbandman.

And a fruitful Christian pleases God much more.

Dir. 23. Be thankful. This pleases the Lord, Psalm. 69. 30, 31. I will praise
the name of the Lord with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving. v.
30. This also shall please the Lord better then an Ox or Bullock that has
horns and hoofs. v. 31. This rendering the Calves of our lips, Hos. 14. 2. is
very pleasing to God, when offered up by Christ. By him therefore let us offer
the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is the fruit of our lips,
giving thanks to his Name, Heb. 13. 15. He that offers praise, glorifieth me,
says God, Psalm 50. Always provided that the praise be cordial and real, as
well as oral; provided that there be estimation of benefits, and retribution
for them, as well as recognition of them.

And now beloved, I must take my leave of you, and what more or better can I
wish or desire for you then this gracious presence of God. The Lord be with you
all. The Lord be with you little children, and incline your hearts to learn
Solomon's lesson which his father taught him, 1 Chronicles. 28. 9. viz. To know the
God of your Fathers, and to serve him with a perfect heart, and a willing mind:
for the Lord searches all hearts, and understands all the imaginations of
the thoughts, if you seek him, he will be found of you, but if you forsake him,
he will cast you off for ever: and for this end, The Lord be with you, and
incline your hearts whilst you are Children, to know, as Timothy did from a
Child, the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise unto salvation
through faith which is in Christ Jesus, 2 Timothy 3. 15. and persuade you to
continue in the things which you have learned, and have been assured of,
knowing of whom you have learned them, 2 Timothy 3. 14.

The Lord be with you young men, and incline your hearts to remember your
Creator in the days of your youth, as you are commanded, Eccles. 12. 1. and
to be kind to him in your youth, Jer. 2. 2. that he may another day say to you,
I remember the kindness of your youth.

The Lord be with you to be the guide of your youth, Jer. 3. 4. and to teach
you from your youth, as he did David, Psalm. 71. 17.

The Lord be with you, that you may with Obadiah fear the Lord from your youth,
1 King. 18. 12. and that you may flee youthful lusts, as you are commanded, 2 Timothy 2. 22.

The Lord be with you, and be your hope and trust from your youth, as he was
David's, Psalm. 71. 5. and make you sober minded, as you are exhorted to be, Tit.
2. 6.

The Lord be with you, and cause you to grow up as plants in your youth, Psalm.
144. 12. That you may never complain, as Job chap. 13. 26. Thou have made me
possess the sins of my youth. And that you may not be forced to pray as David,
Remember not against me the sins of my youth, Psalm. 25. 7. nor lie down in
shame because of the sins of your youth, as they, Jer. 3. 25. and that in your
age, you may not find your bones full of the sins of your youth, Job 20. 11.

The Lord be with you Aged men, to make you sober, grave, temperate, to make
you sound in the faith, sound in charity, in patience, as you are taught to be,
Tit. 2. 2.

The Lord be with you young women, to make you such as you are taught to be,
Tit. 2. 4. viz. Sober, and to love your Husbands, and your children, and to be
discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to your own Husbands, that
the word of God be not blasphemed, and that your Husbands beholding your chaste
conversation coupled with fear, may be won by it, 1 Pet. 3. 1, 2.

The Lord be with you and deliver you from all unchaste thoughts, words, and
actions, and make you careful to preserve your own and your neighbors chastity
in heart, speech, and behavior. This prayer for you is not without need; too
much unchaste behavior is to be seen in our Congregations. I cannot think that
the exposing of your naked backs and breasts to the view of all, can consist
with chastity of heart. I wish that some or other would do that office for you,
that Shem and Japheth did for their father, Genesis 9. 23. and cast at least a
Scarf or Handkerchief over your naked necks, backs and breasts.

The Lord be with you aged women, that you may be such as you are required to
be, Tit. 2. 3. That you may be in behavior as becomes holiness, not false
accusers, not given to much wine, Teachers of good things.

The Lord be with you widows, to cause you to trust in God, as it is your duty,
Jer. 49. 11. and continue in prayer and supplications night and day, 1 Timothy 5.
5.

The Lord be with you Parents, That you may bring up your children in the
nurture and admonition of the Lord, Ephesians. 6. 4. and that you may not provoke
them to anger lest they be discouraged, Col. 3. 21.

The Lord be with you Children, that you may obey your Parents in the Lord, and
honor them, that it may be well with you, and that you may live long in the
earth, Ephesians. 6. 1, 2, 3.

The Lord be with you Masters, that you may give unto your Servants, that which
is just and equal, Col. 4. 1. and forbear threatening, knowing that your Master
also is in Heaven, neither is there respect of persons with him, Ephesians. 6. 9.

The Lord be with you Servants, that you may be obedient to them that are your
Masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of
heart, as unto Christ, not with eye-service as men-pleasers, but as the
servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart, Ephesians. 6. 5, 6.
Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the Inheritance, for ye
serve the Lord Christ, Col. 3. 24.

Yea, the Lord be with you, that you may be subject not only to the good and
gentle, but also to the froward: for this is thankworthy, if for conscience
toward God, you endure grief, suffering wrong fully; and acceptable with God,
if when you do well, and suffer for it, you take it patiently, 1 Pet. 2. 18,
19, 20.

The Lord be with you Husbands, that you may love your wives, and not be bitter
against them, Col. 3. 19. And that you may dwell with them according to
knowledge, giving honor unto them, as unto the weaker vessels, and as being
heirs together of the grace of life, that your prayers be not hindered, 1 Pet.
3. 7.

The Lord be with you wives, that you may be in subjection to your own
husbands; that if any obey not the word, they may be won by your conversation,
while they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear; and that your
adornin^g may not be with outward adorning, of plaiting the hair, and of
wearing of Gold, or of putting on of apparel, but that it may be the hidden man
of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and
quiet spirit, which in the sight of God is of great price, 1 Pet. 3. 1, 2, 3, 4.

The Lord be with you poor: (and my request for you is double.)

1. That you may be poor in spirit, and so blessed, that yours may be the
kingdom of heaven, Mat. 5. 3.

2. That you may be rich in faith, Jam. 2. 5. by which God has promised the
just shall live, Hab. 2. 4.

The Lord be with you Rich, that you may not be high-minded, nor trust in
uncertain Riches, but in the living God, who gives us richly all things to
enjoy, 1 Timothy 6. 17.

The Lord be with you, that you may do good, that you may be rich in good
works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate, that you may lay up in
store for your selves, a good foundation, against the time to come, that you
may lay hold on eternal life, 1 Timothy 6. 18, 19.

The Lord be with you young Disciples, that having put your hands to the plough
you may not look back, lest you prove not fit for the kingdom of God, Luke 9.
92.

The Lord be with you old Disciples, that you may bring forth much good fruit,
and be fat and flourishing, Psalm. 62. 14.

The Lord be with you All, to deal well with you,

To hear your Prayers,

To direct your steps,

To give you rest,

To provide you necessaries,

To protect your persons,

To prevent trouble, or to deliver out of it.

2. At noon, when you go to meat, Psalm. 55. 17.

3. At evening, when you go to bed, Psalm. 55. 17. This was David's practice:
Evening, and Morning, and at Noon will I pray and cry aloud, and not in vain,
for it follows, and he shall hear my voice.

4. The Lord be with you even at midnight, and in the night watches, that even
then you may meditate on Gods word and give thanks after the example of David,
Psalm. 119. 62. and 63. 6. 119. 148.

5. On the week days, that you may do your work, and all your work on them, as
