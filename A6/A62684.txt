Titus Tell-Troth: OR, The PLOT-FOUNDER Confounded. A Pleasant New SONG.
To the Tune of, Hail to the Myrtle Shades.
^HAil to the Knight of the Post; To Titus the Chief of the Town; Titus who
vainly^ did boast of the Salamancha-Gown; Titus who saw the world over, from
the Tower^ of Valadolid, Yet stood in the White-horse Door, and swore to it,
like the Creed.

[2]
Titus at Watton in May,
To Titus at Islington;
And Titus the self same day
Both Here and There again.
Titus who ever swore Truth,
His politic Plots to maintain,
And never yet bawk'd an Oath,
When called to the Test again.
[3]
Then Titus was Meekest of all,
When Never a Penny in's Purse,
And often did on Pickering call,
His Charity to Imburse.
But when He swore Damnable Oaths,
And Lying esteemed no Sin,
Then Titus was One of those
Whom the Devil had entered in.
[4]
Then Titus the Frown of Heaven,
And Titus a Plague upon Earth;
Titus who will never be Forgiven,
Cursed from his Fatal Birth;
Titus the Curse and the Doom
Of the Rich and the Poor Man too;
Oh Titus, thou Shred of a Loom,
What a plague do thou mean to do?
[5]
Titus an Orthodox Beast,
And Titus a Presbyter Tall;
Titus a Popish Priest,
And Titus the shame of all;
Titus who never had the skill
The Wise with his Plots to deceive;
But Titus whose Tongue can kill;
Whom Nature has made a Slave.
[6]
Titus the Light of the Town,
Where Zealots and Whigs do resort;
Titus the Shame of the Gown,
And Titus the Scorn of the Court;
Titus who Spewed out the Truth,
To Swallow the Covenant;
Yet never blushed at an Oath,
Whom Lying has made a Saint.
[7]
Yet Titus believed could be
Against any Popish Lord;
Whilst still against S -- y
The Witness and Truth's abhorred;
So Titus got Credit and Gold
For Lying, nor thought it a Sin;
But against Dissenters bold
The Truth is not worth a pin.
[8]
Thus Titus Swore on apace,
Against those whom he never did see;
Yet Titus with brazen Face
Would our Preserver be.
But as Titus the foremost in Trust
Discovered this Mystery:
May Titus so be the First
That leads to the Triple-Tree.
