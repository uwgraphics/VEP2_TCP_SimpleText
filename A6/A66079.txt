A WARNING TO ALL FRIENDS Who Professes the Everlasting Truth of God, which he
has Revealed and made manifest in this his Blessed Day, (whether on this Side,
or beyond the Seas.)
Dear Friends,
IN Tender Bowels of love, do I feel (from the Lord) a warning Spring in my
heart to you, that you all may be kept low in his humble self denying Life,
where safety is to be found. For assuredly, the great and Notable day of the
Lord is at hand, in which he will arise in the greatness of his strength, to
plead the cause of his suffering Seed, with all its enemies, whether within, or
without.

So all Dear Friends be faithful under your several dispensations, For in our
Fathers house are many Mansions, Keep in the low valleys; For there will be
your safety, there will the green pastures of Gods love be partaken of, and
with such will he delight to dwell. So all Friends keep to your watch, that the
day of the Lord come not in an hour you look not for it, and so you receive the
unfaithful Servants Reward, for indeed Friends my soul is in a great Travel for
the Prosperity of Sion, that her walls may be builded, her breaches Repaired
and made up. For, for many month^ yea some years, has my spirit been bowed
down and groaned under the sense of an easeful, selfish, Lukewarm Spirit, that
has crept in upon many for want of watchfulness, and Keeping to the Daily
Cross of Christ Jesus, and in the Narrow way, and Savoury life, that only will
bring honor and praise to the Name of the Lord. And how to be eased of these
weights and burdens I did not know, my cry was to the Lord that he would give
me wisdom, and strength to do his will. And it pleased him to lay his hand
upon me and bring me near to the gates of Death (so far as I saw) and was
pleased to hide himself from me, and my Soul was in a languishing condition,
and my cries was great unto the Lord that he would not hide his face from me,
but let me feel of his wonted goodness, and mercy, by which I had received
daily comfort and satisfaction from him in his unerring path, in which he had
been pleased to lead me. And at length the Lord appeared, and said he would be
my Physician and cure my disease, and came in and comforted my Spirit, with his
overcoming love, which greatly revived me. And in the openings of the bowels of
his endless love, he showed me, a Terrible day drew near, (even as one may say
at the doors.) And laid it upon me, to go warn his people in this City (and
elsewhere) to Depart from all filthiness both of flesh and Spirit, from all
Lukewarmness, from the fashions, customs, and friendships of this world, from
Pride, Covetousness and every sin that seperatech from the Lord, and brings
dryness, barronnesse, and deadness, upon many, and made as unsavory salt,
that was good for nothing, but to be cast forth and trodden upon.

And to warn them not to delay time, but come into the true humility,
lowliness of spirit, and felfedenying life, that the Lord might be a hiding
place to them, for terrible will that day be to all the unfaithful and
disobedient. All the sinners in Sion shall be afraid, fearfulness shall take
hold on the Hypocrite. Dread and horror shall surprise them. O whither will you
unfaithful fly! would you not be glad that either Rocks or Mountains could hide
you from the presence of the Lord, and the wrath of the Lamb. O this will be a
terrible day indeed, unto all those that have had a form of Godliness, but
denied the power, that would have saved them out of all defilements and
pollutions of this world.

For long has the Spirit of the Lord been grieved with these, who have long
come and sitten amongst Gods people, as if they had been of them, but never
came to sink down to the heart searching Light of Christ Jesus in them, that by
it they might be cleansed, from all secret and open sins, from every Dalilah
that lodges in the bosom, as Pride and Coveteousnesse, which often the one
attends the other, Covetousness (says the servant of the Lord,) is the root
of all evil, and advised them to fly from it, but who abide not in the spirit
of judgment, and of Burning, which God has prepared to purge away the filth
of the daughter of Sion, their filth has not been purged nor done away, which
causes many miscarriages, blots and stains, and great Reflections have such
brought upon the blessed truth; and much dirt has been thrown upon the pure
holy undefiled way of the Lord, which he has cast up, for the Ransomed to walk
in, and so through the unfaithfulness and uneven walking of such, the name of
the Lord has been greatly dishonored, his Spirit grieved, and the hearts of
the Righteous made sad. And many a wounded Soul there is amongst the Lords
people, who are bowed under these weights and pressures, but assuredly the day
hastens that every one must bear their own burden, and the Lord will case his
Innocent ones, who have been bowed down before him, and have mourned and
groaned under these things: yea, the day hastens, that the unfaithful and
disobedient shall bear their own burdens. And the Lord will arise for his own
Name and Glory sake, and will case him of his enemies, and avenge him of his
adversaries, and take to himself his great power, that he may Reign and Rule
in the hearts of his, that (faithfully labor in his work, and) orders their
conversations aright before him; his glory shall rest upon them, for he will
not give it to another seed, or birth, but to Christ Jesus the seed of the
woman; who was given to bruise the Serpents head; he has born the iniquities
of all, and been pressed under them as a Cart with sheaves, his face has been
more marred then any man's, and his voice not heard in the streets, no beauty
nor comeliness seen in him. And because he has been a man of sorrows, and
acquainted with griefs, therefore has he been passed by and not regarded, but
the Lord will make him the joy of many Generations; and his Sion the praise of
the whole earth.

Therefore Dear Friends, love him with all your Souls, and be you delighted in
him, above all enjoyments whatever, that you may lie down in the bosom of his
love, and be nourished by his side, as Children of our heavenly-Father;
begotten by the Immoral word of life, to Live and Reign hear with him (in it,)
and when time shall be no more, enter into that blessed rest, prepared for all
them that have obeyed his glorious Gospel: and though as yet we be but as the
gleaning of the Vintage, yet the Lord has many to gather year, the numberless
number shall be gathered. And great will be the work of our God, which he is
bringing to pass in this his blessed day, it cannot be declared, as it is seen
and felt in the spirit.

So Friends be faithful in the work of your day, be valliant for the Lord and
his blessed truth: Come up in the Nobillity of his life, and stand faithful
witnesses for him; for we are the City set upon a hill, yea, battle Axes in
Gods hand, Though our weapons are not carnal, but Spiritual, and mighty through
the power of God, to the pulling down the strong holds of sin and Satan:
Friends, we are they whom the Lord has raised to hold forth Christ Jesus, whom
he has given for an ensign to the Nations, unto whom all the ends of the earth
must come for salvation;

So Dear Friends, let your light shine forth before men that they may see your
good works and gloryfie your heavenly father, so that by your godly life and
holy conversation many may enquire the way to Sion.

All Friends be faithful, and keep your meetings, in the fear of the Lord, be
dilligent in his work, for the woe and Curse belongs to them that do the Lords
work negligently (or with careless minds,) and it is come on some all-ready,
and will come more upon others, if by speedy repentance they return not unto
the Lord. So be Zealous for the Lord and his truth, and as much as in you lies
gather orderly together as near the time as possible; that the meeting is
appointed at, for Disorderly comeing has been a hurt and burdened the
faithful who dare not be negligent, in the Lords work; and often they have
waited a Considerable season and Gods power has been felt, and the manifold
grace of God been dispensed amongst us, and then others comes in: and misses of
the Counsels, Admonitions, and Refreshments which the Lord by the operation of
his blessed spirit hands forth to his people, and so for want of Zeal in
comeing duly to meetings (especially on the week days) truth has not grown in
them, but such have long traveled in the wilderness: and many Carcasses fallen
there, and so for want of Zeal and faithfulness the enemy has crept in, and
darkened many minds, where once there was tender good desires raised after God,
So all have need to be faithful and wait dilligently every oppertunity the Lord
gives you to feel your strengths renewed, for in the world is many Encumbrances
and Intanglements, some on one hand, and some on another to draw the mind from
God, (and but one to draw it to him,) so there is great need of holy zeal and
diligence, in observing the time to wait upon the Lord to feel your strength
renewed; to help through the many things and his power to strengthen and
support, that in your families and all your undertakings you may be a good
savor to the Lord, being guided by his wisdom to rule and order your Children
and Servants, and he will give Authority to stand over every thing that's
contrary to his witness, And in the fear of the Lord I warn and Exhort all
parents not to wink or Connive at any sin in your Children, as you tender
their Everlasting welbeing, let no sin go on reproved or corrected, but take
the wise man's counsel who says; Folly is bound up in the heart of a Child but
the rod of Correction must drive it out, And he that corrects his Child shall
deliver his Soul from Death: So friends Train up your Children in the Blessed
truth and fear of the Lord, So may you have hope they will not depart from it
(when they are old.) And take heed of giving way or suffering them to get into
pride, and the vain and foolish fashions, which are a shame to Sober people,
and a great inlet to many evils, for they are prone to that by nature, and it
may soon be set up, but hard to get it down; So Friends keep the yoke upon that
Nature that's Proud, Stubborn, or Disobedient to Parents, break that will in
them betimes which comes from the evil one, and bend them while they are young,
least when they grow up yon cannot. And then you may sorrow greatly when it is
too late, for by your over looking their Folly, or Pride, the wrong Nature
grows in them to a strong head, whereby you have helped them forwards in the
broad way which leads to destruction, and their blood (may come) to be required
at your hands. Ah Friends, friends, as much as in you lies keep down the evil,
and the good will arise, then their will be Room for the tender seed to grow up
in them, and they will bless the Lord on your behalfs, for your love and care
of their Immortal Souls.

And all Masters and Mistrisses of Families, Keep in the Dominion of Truth,
that in it you may Rule over every unclean thing, and wrong Spirit, that is
contrary to the Lord, that you abiding in him who is the highest power, (and
higher then the powers of darkness) may in it keep in your Authority in your
Families, and look that all be kept sweet and clean, out of the Condemnable
state, first in your selves; and then in your families to see that all
Wildness, Wantonness, and Rudeness, be kept under by the power; yea every thing
that would blot or stain the precious truth. And then if the Lord Require any
Service or Testimony of any of you, (for this name and blessed truth,) that all
may be clear in your selves and justified by Gods witness, that you have stood
in his Counsel and Authority in your families and been good Examples in life
and conversation, by keeping your own houses in the good Order, and Ruleing
their for God, then may you openly with boldness appear for the Lord, and
thresh down sin and every evil way, in the power and Authority of his life,
that none may have any thing to accuse any of you, (on the accounts above
mentioned,) And dear Friends all keep in the savory life; but more especially
you who are drawn forth to bear public Testimonys for the Lord and his
blessed truth, keep you to the watch that at all times, Places, and on all
occasions your lives may preach for God, by a clean unspoted Conversation,
which is the Crown of all the faithful, who labor in the work of the Lord,
and are upright before him, his Glory shall rest upon them and their Reward is
sure.

Now unto all you young people Sons and Daughters, Apprentices, Men or Maids,
Servants, all that are convinced of Gods truth and the way that leads to
everlasting life and happiness, be you all faithful to Gods witness in you, and
mind the motions and opperations of it, that thereby you may be changed, and
all judge out what is contrary to his pure witness, let not your minds wander
neither look out at the vanities in this world, for Christ's Kingdom is not of
it, nor to be found in Pride, wantonness and lusts of the flesh; The Fashions,
Customs, and friendships of this world, for the Devil is the King of pride,
and all its attendants that leads to the gates of Hell and everlasting
destruction, where is the Woe and Misery and that for evermore, there the worm
never dies, the fire never goes out, so all you young and tender ones, where
desires are begotten after God, keep you low in his fear, and to the daily
Cross that all the contrary may be crucified, and all the Enmity slain upon
it. For every one that will be a disciple of Christ Jesus, must come into the
selfedenying life, (you cannot have two Kingdoms,) So my advice to you all is,
stoop to Christ's appearance in you, he who Invites all to come and learn of
him, who is meek and lowly and you shall find rest to your souls. So all be
faithful in your several places and the exercises you may be under, that you
may grow in grace and in the fear and wisdom of God, let not your eyes look
out at others, but mind your own Conditions for if you do it will Spy many
faults in others, and may be over look more at home, This hinders the grouth of
many, so all wait low within to feel your grouth in the Blessed truth, and
know how the work goes on, and whether thou feel Gods love, mercy and goodness
Renewed to thee day by day, or not, for your accounts will be for the deeds
done in your bodies and not for other, so every one is to labor to know your
calling and election made sure.

And you that are Apprentices keep in the truths love and obey it, for it will
keep you faithful in your places and (out of every deceitful way) performing
them not with eye-service but with singleness of heart, as unto the Lord, from
whom you must receive a Reward. And if the enemy entice, consent not. Though he
come in with never so fair pretenses; that thou may deceive thy Master, and
it will never be known etc. Or purloin or waste his Goods, believe him not he
is a Liar and the Father of lies, for there is an Eye that sees in secret,
which will bring all the hidden deeds of darkness to Light and every work to
judgment, So as thy work is shall be thy Reward. But fear the Lord and obey
his voice in thee, and he will deliver thee out of every unclean way, and
polluted path, by his dear Son Christ Jesus whom he has given for a high way
of Holiness, and a Restorer of paths to dwell in, Glory to his Name for ever,
says the Redeemed, who is now returning unto Sion with Songs of diliverance in
their mouths; and everlasting high praises is sounded unto him, by those whose
garments are made white in the blood of the Lamb, for Sions Redeemer is come,
the taker away of sin and iniquity is made manifest, the mourners in Sion
comforted, The weary Travelers are Refreshed, The feeble knees are
strengthened, the broken Spirit bound up, and the wounded Soul has oil poured
in, who can but rejoice and be exceeding glad, for he has put a new Song in
our mouths, he has given his people beauty for Ashes, and in stead of
heaviness the spirit of praise, all that know him will speak well of his name,
for all the Noble Acts he has brought to pass for his Children. My soul is
greatly affected in the Remembrance of the Lords numberless mercyes (to me)
and a little Remnant whom he has plucked as Brands out of the fire, to show
forth his praises and declare of his goodness in the Land of the living, to
hold forth Christ (the way to the Father,) To the Nations, that his scattered
seed may be gathered from all the ends of the earth.

So I have cleared my Spirit of what has long lain upon me, and discharged my
Conscience in delivering the Lords Message faithfully, according to the
abillity he has given me. And so am clear in my Spirit: The Lord set it home
upon every heart whom it may concern, and that it may be Received, in the same
bowels of love it was given forth. Then shall I have my reward; and the Lord
his Glory. And so shall return to my Tent, and enter into the hole of the Rock,
where safety is to be found, till the indignation be overpast, and in the
endless unchangable love of God, do I Salute you, and bid you Farewell in the
Lord.
