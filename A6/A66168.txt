Printers to the King and Queens most Excellent Majesty's. 1691.

His Majesty's MOST GRACIOUS SPEECH To both HOUSES of PARLIAMENT.
My Lords and Gentlemen,
I Must not lose this Occasion of Returning you My hearty Thanks, for the Great
Proofs you continue to give Me of your Zeal and Resolution to Support and
Assist Me, in the Vigorous Prosecution of the War against France next Year; And
I Assure you, it shall be My greatest Care; That the Assistances you give Me,
may be so Applied, as to Render them most Effectual for the Ends you Design
them; But I must take Notice to you at the same time, with some Trouble; That
the New Year is already come, while Our Preparations for it are not only more
Backward, but those of Our Enemies, as We have reason to think, in greater
Forwardness then they were the last Year; I find My self therefore Necessitated
from this Consideration most Earnestly to Recommend to you, Gentlemen of the
House of Commons, the Hastening of such farther Supplies, as you Design to
Enable Me with, for the Prosecution of the War.

My Lords and Gentlemen,
The Season being so far Advanced, this present Sessions cannot Admit of a much
longer Continuance; And therefore I must Recommend to you the Dispatch of all
such other Bills also, as you shall judge necessary for the Public Good.

FINIS.
