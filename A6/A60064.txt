A DESCRIPTION OF THE INSURRECTION That was in the WEST.
GReat troubles in this Land has been,
Strange controversies us between,
Which may apparently be seen,
And is not like to cease.
Who knows what danger may ensue,
Since private Plotters are not few,
A wicked and licencious Crew,
Averse from any peace.
To speak of them in general,
Whiggs or Phanaticks, them we call;
They are a turbulent Caball,
Without all kind of rule.
Who of Religion thinks them strong,
Yea, certainly they do them wrong;
For it to them does not belong,
Nor none that are so cruel.
O strange! it was a desperate act,
Committed by that bloody fact,
From serving God they turned back,
The Bishop for to murder.
When they had their design fulfilled,
So that the Bishops blood had spilled,
They praised the Lord they had prevailed;
Then they proceeded further.
Blood guiltiness they hold no sin,
Therefore they gloried much therein,
The Devil possesses them within,
That falls in such despair.
When that the Primat they dispatched,
They bitterly against others snatched,
Intending us for to have caught
Into their dreadful snare.
Blessed be the Lord, who all commands,
Disposed us not into their hands,
Who would had both our lives and lands,
But blessed be the Lord.
Who turned the Wheel another way,
When they rose up us for to slay;
They thought to have us made a prey,
According to their word.
When they began in Fife to rise,
Best Horses they did make a prize,
Then thiev'd and robbed in such a guise.
That none could them defeat.
Religion they did abuse,
All godliness they did refuse;
What shall they have for their excuse
Before the Judgment Seat?
To speak of them I will forbear,
And will make known the progress clear,
How they themselves behaved here,
In their rebellious plots.
They mounted Shepherds on Horse back,
And Websters were not worth a plack,
So bitterly they boast and crack,
These silly simple sots.
They troubled Fife exceeding sore;
As never was the like before,
In hostile manner more and more
They mightily increast.
At Largo-Law they did conveen,
From thence they marched to Falkland green
Straight to the Struthers Park at even,
Where they all night did rest.
They put us in a feary fary,
Caused many man and wife them wary,
Next day they marched without ten tarry,
Intending for the West.
When they were marching on the way,
Nothing they thought could them afray,
That morning was a pleasant day,
But after twelve a blast.
When they their enemies saw approach,
Who sadly on them did incroach,
They thought it was a sad reproach,
They taken were for traitors.
Some died, some wounded in the field,
Some cried for quarters, and did yield
Up all their Arms, both Spear and Shield:
O! poor fantastic ^reaures.
In Louthian Shire, and eke the Mers,
Through Tweddale with their foot and horse,
Where they did fight, but got the worse,
Who well des^rv'd the same.
They did pretend some piety,
But turned it to hypocrisy;
Rejoicing more in Robbery,
Religion did defame.
For all their foul defeat in Fife,
Whereby some of them lost their life,
Yet they would not leave off their strife,
But still made insurrection.
From every where they marched full fast
So privately into the West,
Where nothing there could them aghast,
They feared no objection.
At Lowdon-hill, as I hear say,
They set themselves in battle ray,
And solemnly did swear and say
They would not be remiss:
To fight the battles of the Lord,
They did consent with one accord;
All who does suffer for the Lord
Shall have eternal bliss.
But suddenly a Squad of Horse
Called up their Baggage unaworse,
A cunning conduct had of Mars,
Made some of them bewail.
They knew not well what hand to flee,
They were in so great jeopardie;
Still did lament the misery
Which there to them befell.
Yet notwithstanding they amain
Did get a new Recruit again,
From wickedness would not refrain,
Therein did take delight.
They in the West did rudely ring,
Great trouble to the Land did bring,
In great derision of the King,
Who all his life did slight.
Still they increased and multiplied,
Like monstrous beasts, without a head,
The blind did get the blind to lead;
Discipline knew they none.
Some greatly feared they were but lost,
Without a Captain to the Host:
They chois'd a man who made great boast,
Called Robert Hamilton.
To Hamilton Wood he did them bring,
Where Mavise they heard sweetly sing;
They cried, O blessed be our King! (Jesus)

For this sweet harmony.
Yea, certainly it signifies,
We shall subdue our enemies,
Who over us does tyrannize,
Yea, with great cruelty.
Thus was their head so full of notions,
They laid aside all their devotions,
And thought the ground of their promotions
Hard Flint, which turned to Glass^s.
They thought us all for to have caught
Into their snare, and so dispatched,
Like to the Phoenix, long they hatched,
And perished in their ashes.
Our King and Council did consent,
All future danger to prevent,
The forces raised incontinent
Belonging to Scotland.
The month of June the 17. day,
The Military Forces, they
Marched to the West without delay,
The Rebels to command.
At the Moor-head they did encamp,
Their fight did shine like to a Lamp;
Three nights or four the Corn did tramp,
Which growing was full green.
Both Corn and Grass went to decay,
Their Bestial did take and slay;
The people fled out of the way,
No man was to be seen.
The Duke of Monmouth was sent down
From London, even to Edinburgh Town,
Straight to the Camp he made him bown,
Well guarded was with Horse.
Where they received him courteously,
And him saluted reverently,
Himself behaved courageously,
Who represented Mars.
The power he had, and sole command
Over all the Forces in Scotland,
The enterprise did take in hand,
The Rebels to subdue.
For the offense done to our King,
We shall them to confusion bring,
Except that they repent this thing,
Some shall it sadly rue.
Then was the Forces ordered right,
Eight miles they marched into the night,
Next morning when the day grew light
The Rebels did appear.
They back and forward still carreer'd,
In great hostility appeared;
They thought nothing could them have feared
Their swords were glancing clear.
They boasted fast, and cried afar,
Come, Dogs, and venture, if ye dar,
We are prepared now for War,
We know our cause is good.
The Lord he is upon our side,
Who is an all-sufficient guide,
Therefore with him we will abide,
And venture our dear blood.
Now June the two and twenty day,
At Bothwel Bridge began the play,
At the first Fire they fled away,
As sheep out of the fold.
Great things they promised to do,
The which they solemnly did vow;
But when the push they were put to,
Their courage waxed cold.
Our Cannoneer gave such a blast,
That put them all in such aghast,
Which made the first of them be last,
The swiftest lead the Van.
Fled from the Bridge, their great support,
Like cowardly Cullions left their Fort;
To see the flight it was good sport,
So couchingly they ran.
In solemnizing of their game,
Two Guns were loosed after them,
Which put their spirits out of frame,
That formerly made boast.
When that our Host the Bridge did man,
They merrily marched on the Van,
Until they passed every man:
Again drew up the Host.
Whose conduct was a shining Star,
Conjunct with Mars the God of War;
They two together joined, who dar
Them any more oppose.
So marched on triumphantly,
Amongst them was great melody,
By reason of their victory,
In which they did rejoice.
The Whiggs I wot was ill content,
Their Father Welsh would not consent
To fight again, but straight he went
Away, and left the crowd.
But Hamilton, as it was said,
As sheep them to the slaughter led;
Like Sisera himself he fled,
And left the multitude.
So Iabins Host they were exposed
Into their hands who them enclosed,
And afterward on them disposed,
Of whom they made a prey.
Our Cannon played on them like thunder,
Dispersed them all quite asunder;
To flee I think it was no wonder,
It was not fit to stay.
The feigned Horse their Foot betrayed,
At the first Gun were so afraid;
They wheeled about, no longer stayed,
But fled with all their might.
For their delusion, God, I say,
Will count with them the Judgment day,
When every one their debt must pay,
In presence of his sight.
But when their Foot did take the flight*
To make escape with all their might,
Some ran to holes, some to the hight,
With many a wallaway.
The Highlanders did quickly follow,
In victory them up to swallow,
Caused many in their blood to wallow,
Crying alace that day.
Then orders came their lives to spare,
And bring them in from every where;
Straight to the Camp with them repair,
Where they shall be secured.
More then a thousand in did bring,
Amongst whom there was both Kid and King*
Who drowsily their Lugs did hing,
With countenance demured.
They were committed to the Guard,
Expecting but a bad reward,
The Gallows which themselves prepared
Their captives on to hing:
To that same Gauows were they brought,
Where all of them expected naught,
But Haman-like, up to be caught,
A punishment condign.
Yet mercy on them was conferred,
Their punishment it was deferred,
And to the Council was referred,
To pay them their Arrears,
Next morning they were sent away,
Well guarded, who without delay
Took them to Edinburgh, I say,
Then up to the Gray-Friers.
Into which place they were confined,
Until some of their hearts inclined,
To offer with a willing mind
For to subscribe the Band.
Wherein they promised faithfully,
Obedience with alacrity
Of heart, to serve his Majesty,
In order to command.
This finished, they were absolved,
Then quickly from the rest dissolved,
To their own homes they straight resolved,
When liberat from prison.
But those that would not give consent
Unto the Bond, incontinent
To the Talbooth apart were sent,
Then punished for treason.
Especially, both Kid and King
Were brought to punishment condign,
As greatest traitors to our King,
Who many did delude.
And they did suffer for the cause,
Of abrogating all our Laws,
Like Infidels, I say, because
Nothing they understood.
But what became of all the rest,
I know not how they were suppressed,
In prison where they were distressed,
And brought to fell confusion.
Some did lament their weary case,
With weeping, wailing, saying, Alace,
That e're they should have seen his face,
The cause of their delusion.
The Prisoners I Will let alone,
And will return to Hamilton,
With Welsh, Cargill, and Cameron,
S^ill sowers of sedition.
Their seed, it is certain, is not good,
If it be rightly understood,
The product is nothing but blood,
The end of their ambition.
For mischief was their seeds then sown,
More then for gaining souls to Heaven;
Their great design was to have driven
Us from our Royal right.
Blessed be his Name who does preserve
All who his statutes do observe:
Lord, let us never from thee swerve,
But in thy Laws delight.
They subtle, like the Gibeonites,
Who did betray the Israelites:
At best they are but hypocrites,
Unsound in their profession.
When they pretend to serve the Lord,
Amongst themselves they do discord,
Whereby they do abuse the Word,
Which is a high transgression.
They inspiration have of Satan,
Abiram-like, and Cora, Dathan,
Transversing like the Leviathan,
Averse from any rule.
Fomenting still in bitter ire,
Insatiate in their desire,
By Vulcan they are set on fire,
And Saturn adds to fewer.
At Torwood where they played a spring,
To dance, the Devilled the King,
They excommunicate the King,
An execrable work.
Yea, they themselves engaged further,
Great many in our Land to murder,
Was never heard a plot absurder,
Contrived by the Turk.
They like Abimelech would reign,
If they had all in governing,
To fell confusion would they bring
The greatest in our Land.
To which they did all condescend,
All ready this they did intend:
From such, I say, Lord us defend,
With thine Almighty hand.
Great reason have we for to fear
Some judgment on our Land this year,
Prognosticated by the Sphere
Proceeding from a Star.
We fear great Famine, or the Sword,
By slighting of thy sacred Word;
Now call us home again, O Lord,
Who Is gone astray so far.
Since Judgment we deserve so clear,
Lay no more on then we can bear,
Cause us thy holy Name to fear,
And thankful be for all.
Dispell the cloud that dims our sight,
That darkness which obscures our light,
Illuminate our hearts aright,
To wait upon your call.
Unite our hearts throughout your Land,
That we may join all hand in hand,
For to observe thy own command,
Thy Name to glorify.
Us gather all in one sheepfold,
That we the Shepherd may behold,
His Name for ever be extolled
To all eternity.
FINIS.
