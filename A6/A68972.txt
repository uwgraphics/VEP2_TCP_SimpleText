(...) yet some be disposed to contemplacion
To prayer to study / of their goodness
And some (the more pity) to sloth / and ydelnesse
Now sith that I am lowest of degree
A man of holy church by true profession
Consyderyng the conditions of people worldly
(As before is said) my fully entencion
By divine grace and gostly supportacion
Is for to write the life historiall
Of Radegunde the princess queen and moniall
After my reason me think more convenient
To spend winter nyghtes in such business
For dread of temptation and causles insolent
Rather than to lose such time in ydelnesse
Which to all vice / is rote and maistresse
Envy to virtue / a stepmother to study
Occasyon of ruin / and mycle malady.
A secondary cause / mouyng me thereto
To write the life of this virgyn glorious
Was the instant desire / and peticyon also
Of special friends / honest and virtuous
Which lately required me fall memorious
With synguler request / and humble instaunce
This life to discrybe / with due circumstaunce
To whom I granted / under this condicyon
That of their wysedom / they would excuse me
And take this poor deed / of no presumpcion
Nor done for vauntage / avoiding vaynglore
But alonly to content their mind and satisfy
Where they know well my insufficience
My great ignorance / and also necligence
The third cause mouyng most princypally
Is for to extolle / the glorious name
Of this holy virgyn / and gracious lady
With honor / reverence / and excellent fame
To the common people / desiryng the same
Whose life has been kept scilent many a day
Known to few persons within this countray
Therefore I require / and pray you euerychone
That this litell treatise shall reed or se
To accept my mind with your discrecion
And it to correct after your charity
Amend the matter / where is necessite
For sith it is known / that I am no clarke
Under protestacion / I proceed to Warke
And where I unworthy / this treatise begin
I humble beseke our blessed savior
His mother also mary the virgyn
To be my help / comfort / and succoure
Now sweet Radegunde / of virgins the flower
Make supplicacion / unto the trinite
And direct my pen to describe thy stori
Of the progeny of saint Radegunde and how she was taken in batell and married
to Lothary a king of France.
THe year of our savior by full computacion
Five hundredth fully from the natiuite
As diverse auctours makyn description
Reyned in France in honor and ryalte
Two noble kings / Childebert / and Lothary
Every king knowing his part and regyon
To them belonging / by right and custom
At the same season / as says the history
A noble prince / reyned in Africa
Named in cronicles king Berengary
Borne at a city named Thorynga
within the said kyndome now called Barbarea
Which prince Whylom famous in renown
Till that dame fortune unfriendly put him down.
Which foresaid prince king Berengarius
Had in succession a noble princess
A devout lady / and a virgyn glorious
Nominat Radegunde / a gemme of holiness
A flower of virtue / and a myrrour of meekness
whose gostly governance enduryng her life
Unto all people may be a perspectyfe
This king Berengary by mysfortune in batell
Was piteously subdued / by kings of France
His realm conqueryd / piteously to tell
Losing his honor land / and governance
And Radegunde taken / such was her chance
By power removed / from her land natural
Among strangers to be continual
When the king and the realm subdued were
And maid Radegunde taken for a pray
Than the kings of France for her in fere
Intended batell / which should have the may
For she was beauteous and pleasant verray
Humble / gentle / courtese / and most fair truly
yet she by lot fell / unto king Lothary
For if Radegunde had not delyuerd be
Great cruelte / business / and vexacion
Had fortuned among kings three
Through great disdeyn / pride / and ambicyon
For the realm of France in a triniall kyndome
Than was divided cronicles do express
As the sequence of saint Martyn does rehearse
This lady Radegunde / thus taken away
And by chance delivered to king Lothary
Was brought with worship in to a countray
Called Ueromandensis unto the kings city
Nominat Atheras / to be kept in suertie
There to be norisshed / and have refeccion
Doctrine and disciplyne / with hie discrecyon
King Lothary considering her gentilnesse
Her virtue / patience / and proved wisdom
Her great humilite / constaunce / and soberness
Daily encreasyng with augmentacion
Intended to mary spedely and soon
Lady Radegunde / and virgyn serene
To make her his spouses and lovely queen
Unto this marriage and feast there was
Made great preparacion / and rialtie
The halles were hanged / with clothes of arras
Rychely embrodered in ryall Imagery
The.xii. apostelles well set in degree
Martyrs / confessors / and virgyns withal
were their purtered / with crown victoriall
Over the side tables curiously were wrought
Ancient histories of auctorite
Of patriarchs and prophets wisely out sought
Of the old and new testament set properly
Histories were painted of poetry
Chambers were strawed with flowers fragrant
well dect with hangynges / fresshe / fair / and vernant
This princess was clad in clothes of gold
In sylkesse / veluettes / and tyssues fine
A coronall was ordained richely to be hold
And crowned therewith / as crystal did shine
Set with ryall stones / the sapher celestyne
The diamont / the diadeke / the ruby / the topas
The carbuncle / the emerall / the perle their was
Lords of the land were ready present
Dukes / earls / barons / and knights doughty
The commons assembled ever delygent
To give attendaunce as was their duty
The day was appointed / of the matrimony
The chapel enowrned with mycle richesse
The clergy attending at an hour express
King Lothary passed from his ryall palace
With many mighty peers and lords of his land
Radegunde him followed a princess full of grace
With ladies many one the fear could befounde
They came to the chapel as we understand
All thing was prepared to that solempnite
Ornaments and vestures of great ryaltie
The bishop was ready / with his ministers all
To execute his office / of the said matrimony
The obseruauntes was done with honor ryall
The mass was song / with mycle melody
With belles / and orgons / and solemn minstrelsy
The sacrament of spousage / was celebrat that day
With reverence and worsship / in their best array
From thens they departed / to the kings palace
The said king and queen / the lords / and clergy
All things well ordered (as before said was)
To attend in the hall marshalles were ready
Of meats and drinks / their was great plenty
Ueneson Wildfoule mycle abundance
The condites of wine ran with great pleasaunce
But for all this ryaltie / and wordly pleasure
Which was prepared / at this solempnite
The queen Radegunde pass^ng course of nature
Most dreadful in heart / was for her virginite
Desired our savior of his endless charity
As he for us all suffered better passion
To preserve her body from all corrupcion
Of the virtuous living of saint Radegund under spousage / and how she
continued a pure virgyne
When the day declyned and come was the night
And all people passyd echone to his lodging
The heart of Radegunde was litell of might
yet privately she went to her chamber weeping
Made great lamentacion dolefully sighing
Required our lord to help of his pytie
To whom she had offered before her virginite
Alas what tongue can plainly express
Or heart may think / the dreadful Ieopardy
This lady Radegunde feared doutlesse
When her lord was laid her sweet body by
Her soul was rapt / her mind in an ecstasy
Plonged in heuenes / woe and penalite
More lever to be deed / than lose her chastity
But as scripture says / our blessed savior
Is ever ready in extreme necessite
To help his servants both day and hour
When they do call / with pure humilite
He saved saint Agnes / saint Lucie / saint Cecilie
With many other mo / from all corrupcion
Right so he preserved Radegunde that season
For when Lotharias desired to supply
Natural pleasure and voluptious entention
By divine power and by miracle sothlie
His fervent desire with carnal affeccion
Were clerly extincted for above reason
Such frail concupiscence of love entyre
Soon seized as water quenches the fire
Other sundry seasons / when the said king
Was moved at will / to have his desiderye
The queen found remedy / at her own likyng
Sometime feynyng sickness / and infirmite
Sometime not disposed to such fragilite
Sometime occupied / in labors diligent
Other time obiectyng / the time not convenient
Thus by the grace / of her spouse Jesus
She ever preserved her true chastity
Geuyng her self / to prayer and to virtue
Lowyng our lord / of his benignite
And his mother Mary / flower of virginite
Which of his mercy / and infinite goodness
Has her preserved / in all distress
And though she was married to king Lothary
A wordly prince / sekyng for honor
She clearly refused / such pomp and vain glory
And served her spouse / our sauyoure
Transitory pleasurs / worship and decoure
Were truly abiected / and all such felicite
More humble in will / than parmitted dignite
In wordly vanites / she had no pleasure
To give good example / was her hole intent
Sermons to here / was all her great cure
Love and charity in heart were ay fervent
Her lands and tents / given by assigment
Were truly tithed / Where was necessite
To captive prisoners / and people in pouerte
All rentes / and richesse / that she might com to
Were distribute to monasteris in devotion
Besekyng the covent to pray for her also
And for her lord / and all the region
Unto such places / as she might not come
By personal presence / for distaunce of place
Thither she send almys in short time and space
This noble queen had a principal mind
Upon the poor people in great penalite
Showing works of mercy / acordyng to kind
Helpyng all woeful wretchesse in misery
Thynkyng all myspend / that they had not truly
Beleuyng that Christ in every poor creature
Lay secret and prive under their figure
When she was richely / served at her table
With costly dayentes and delicacy
with mighty wyndes strong and comfortable
Convenient for her estate and regalie
With such metes she nolde content her body
But did absteyne / and took refeccion
With small potage of her own decoccion
To punysshe her person / more strayte and sharply
Reuiuyng her sprite to meditacion
She ware the herd here / next to her body
With precious clothes reclothed there upon
Discrete abstinence / against rebellion
Wisely oppressed / by the help of Jesus
Her corpse making / apt to prayre and virtue
As Radegunde lay with her prince of right
She asked license of a common custom
To depart and rise from bed every night
For natural necessite / acordyng to reason
From whom when she was departed and gone
She went to prayer all night following
Platte upon an here / on her knes knelyng
So with continuance / all the night season
Fervent in soul / to please god almighty
Till her vital sprite by true devotion
Were almost confused / and put in Ieopardy
Through colnesse frost / and all her body
From sensual felyng of her wits five
Clearly were expulsed / by mind contemplative
Wherefore it was said of her lord and king
Of his true subgettes / and the commons all
That his noble lady / by gostly lyueng
Was not as queen / but rather a moniall
The king her blamed in termys rural
Reprouyng her customs / with great confusion
Whom she humble suffered without contradiccion.
Of the great devotion she used namely in time of lenton / and of the great
pity she had to all captive prisoners.
When the time of lenton approached nere
To speak of her penance / is a strayte thing
For at the same time / with conscience clear
She send to a religious woman in lyueng
Nominat Pia / her fully mind sheweng
To whom this moniall / knowing her intent
Send Radegunde an here sealed full diligent
Which here this lady (as rehearsed is)
With reverence received / and put next her body
Trustyng in the vesture great comfort and blis
Pleasant to our lord / to her soul remedy
And yet she would were clothes richely
Upon the said here in the time of lenton
Expellyng fame / and wordly commendacion
Upon solemn days / and feestes principal
The queen was reuest / with clothes of gold
With tissewes fine / and veluettes at all
And when the common people / young and old
Praised such garments / with fame manyfolde
She utterly abhorred / such riall rich clothyng
Send them to churhces / for priests in to sing
By fortune if Lothary her lord were absent
Who would than believe / her singular devotion
Her prayer / abstinence / and heart penetent
Her great contricion and humble supplicacion
Ever remembryng our lords passion
Submittyng her self as unto his fete
Wasshesyng his wounds / with tears salt and wete
She refused glotony / by virtuous temparaunce
Our savior Jesus was her hole refeccion
Upon bodily feding / gave litell attendaunce
Daily prouidyng her souls sustentacion
Great vigilles / penance / and holy orison
Refresshed her soul / and the body also
No penance was tedious for her to do
If any transgressour were Iuged to dye
Or any man suffered wrong accusacion
She was so mercyable / and full of pity
For them to the king / she made intercession
Knelyng full mekely / desyring peticyon
And to his counsel with prayer continual
Till she had pardon / and grace for them all
All the kings court / example might take
To use humilite / and great gentylnesse
At lady Radegunde / and sin to forsake
For why she was called / of more and of less
Rather a minister / than to be a maistresse
Deligent to serve / every time and season
Pore / as well / as rich with great devotion
Another man ne child / dwelling in the palace
Was discontent / at this sweet lady
She had such wysdone / and singular grace
Transcendyng other ladies / of memory
Dukes / earls / and barons / and all their progeny
Example may take / at this queen ryall
To increase in meekness / and virtuous moral
By her great prudence / and exortacion
The king was moved / to grace and pity
Merciable to the pore / in all his region
Having compassion / lyberall / and fre
To execute Justice prompte with mercy
A good benefactour / to places religyous
By the instant mocion / of his queen virtuous.
How queen Radegunde showed a great miracle deliueryng prisoners out of
captivity.
THis noble queen every solemn day
Of custom would rise erly as the light
And go to her chapel / secretly to pray
Seruyng our savior / with all her heart and might
Ensuyng mary Magdalayne in mind full right
To mattens / and to mass / after she would gone
And all day following use meditacion
Thus by contynuaunce / in grace and goodness
In prayer / abstinence / vigils / and chastity:
This lady Radegunde / queen and princess
Replete with meekness / virtue and charity
Showed diverse miracles / within the country
The first miracle / was done in the palace
(As says the history) by deuyne grace
As Radegunde passed the palace by a prison
where many prisoners were fettred in durances
For her pastyme / solace / and consolacion
With lords / knights and other servants
When the prisoners perceived / being in penance
That it was the queen / their sovereign lady
With loud voice / they began on her to call and cry
O noble princess / O kings daughter dear
O lady of grace / and queen imperial
Succoure us thy servants which lie bound here
Extend thy charity / upon us wretches all
Deliver us from death / save from pains thrall
Be merciful to us / hartfully we the pray
And we will amend our lives / after this day
This lady heryng / such great lamentacion
Inwardly was moved to mercy and pity
Required to know / with tender compassyon
What people cried on her so piteously
The servants answered again (verite)
Saying that they were beggars at the gate
Common to have alms of so great estate
Also the Iayler again all conscience
Rebuked his prisoners vnpiteously
Caused them be still / and keep scilence
Manasing them to beat / punisshe / and mortyfy:
Conciled the truethe / from his sovereign lady
Thus the said prisoners / put to more pain
Had pain upon pain / without mercy certain
But the next night following / by miracle right
The fetters / the bonds / of the prisoners all
Suddenly were broken / and losed in their sight
And they were delivered from pains thrall
They passing from prison / the gates down did fall
They came the said night / to Radegunde their lady
Thankyng her echone / for her grace and mercy
They knelyd on kne / for gladness weeping
Saying O sovereign lady / and maistresse
Honor be to the / grace and long lyueng
Which has delivered / us from distress
Personally this night / or else one in thy likeness
Now blessed Jesus / redemptour of us all

For to receive her in to holy religion

Of her coming to Pictauis religious to be
In the mean while Radegund gave to the poor
Much ryall richesse / and vestures liberally
Reseruyng to her person / and her use no more
Than she daily used / for honor necessary
So alone proseded / unto the monastery
From the kings court / privily in the night
Unknowen to each creature / save to ye king of might
Upon the other day / where the king perceived
The sudden departure of his lady sufferayne
He bitterly wayled / that he was dysceued
Send diverse messangers / with a sure captain
First to enquire / and bring her again
Supposyng to have her / in short time and space
After she aproched / to the religious place
But the holy ghost / confortour of all care
Defendyd Radegunde / at this extremite
For as she passyd / the fair feldes all bare
She said to an husband / besy in husbandry
People will follow after / for to pursue me
From which company I declyne certain
Prayeng the consyle / my presens / and it layne
It behooves the not / from the truth to varray
Say that thou seem come this same way
The season / day / and time / rennyng full hastily
Thou did sow this corn affirmyng it varray
And thus excuse me / hertfully I the pray
She passyd this plowman / in to a secret place
For dread druly daryng / trustyng our lords grace
Incontinently the corn newly cast in ground
Began for to blade and bear in every place
To ear and to ripe (her enemies to confound)
All ready to be shorn / within an hour space
The otes began to shede / the husband besy was
And made great provision with sicle and sithe that morn
To cut down the otes / in saving of the corn
After the said virgyn / messangers made great haste
Shortly to to supple their lords commandment
They found the husband repyng corn full fast
Whom they required / to show on pain of priso^me^t
If any fair lady / or maid by him went
To tell when / and whyther / and which way yt she is
Auoydyng great displeasure / showing not amys
Worshipful masters / the husband than can say

And heuely returned to the king again

Thankyng our lord / and his mother Mary
Of her expedicion / with micle reverence

So did the covent / and the company all
Of this noble queen / to be conuentuall
Mekely she made singular peticion
To be religious vsyng life monastical
Thabbasse granted / and the covent echone
Received her gladly / and made her a moniall
Where first she laid a side her purpull and pall
All rich vestures / of gold / and tissewes fine
Her crown / and coronall / set with stones celestyne
She was reclothed / with religious vesture
The mantell of meekness / the veil of black color
The wympull of wayling / of humble gesture
With other many vestures / of virtue that same hour
Thus for the love of our savior
All wordly pleasures vain / and transitore
She has refusyd / obedient to be
When the year passed of her probacion
She truly professyd the essencials three
Made a solemn vow before the congregacyon
Obedience to keep also pure chastity
Enduryng her life / with wilful pouerte
She received the ryng / of heavenly spousage
Was married to Jesus enduryng this pilgrimage
And as mine auctour plainly does express
The venerable Antoninus / in his history
This lady Radegund / of her great goodness
Bylded before time the said monastery
By the help of her husband king Lothary
Where after she was elect lady and abbasse
By help of saint Medarde a man of great grace
When she was abbasse / she took to her company
A number of virgyns in hye perfeccion
To whom she gave the example daily
Of pure humilyte / and perfyt devotion
Of virtuous lyueng / and contemplacion
Perfourmyng in her person / for goostly mede
All thing commanded / to her systers in deed
But the mortal enemy / of all mankind
Considering in her / such grace and virtue
By malice / and envy / forcast in his mind
By some subtylte / this maid to subdue
He tempted her husband / a prince full of virtue
By power / and sloth to take his wife again
Out of religion / the more pity certain
This said king Lothary / in conscience blind
Came with his company / to the city of Turon
Under craft / and polesy prepensyd in mind
With the notable prince / Sygibert her son
Dyssemblyng pilgrimage / and goostly entencion
Approchyng Pectauis / the rather that he might
Take from religyon / his wife that same night
When Radegunde / hard tell his subtell polysy
How he was paruerted as man without grace
She wept and wayled / in soul tenderly
For sorrow of her husband / which sometime was
In her heart no confort / was found nor solace
For dread of deceyte / and ymagined treason
Prayeng to our lord / for help that same season
She made secret letters / and send her intent
Closed and sealed / unto saint Garmayne
Bishop of Parise / which than was present
With king Lothary / making her complaynt
Woefully lamenting / expressed in deed plain
Desiryng the bishop / with humble supplycacion
To convert the king / from his wrong opynion
When saint Germayne these letters had reed
He prostrat him self to the fete of the king
Before saint Martyns tomb prayeng him in deed
By the order of charity / many salt tears weeping
And for the love of god / to conferme his askyng
That he no further / would proceed in way
Nor come to Pectauis / for dread of death that day
The king considering / in soul his great trespace
With bytternesse of heart / remembryng his peticion
Should come of Radegund / by singular grace
With contrit heart and mind / made plain confession
Excusing his defaute / by evil suggestion
Prostrat his person unto saint Germaynes fete
Desiryng indulgence / with salt tears and wete
Reputyng his presence / simple and unworthy
For to call again his wife / from religion
Which is the spouse / of our lord almighty
And under his license entered professyon
Required the bishop spedely to gone
To lady Radegunde absolved for to be
Lest punysshement fell on him / soon and hastele
Which thing the bishop was glad for to do
Came to Pectauis / unto her oratorie
And kneled at her fete / desiryng her also
To forgive the king / his intent and misery
Which thing she did in heart / and word gladly
Thankyng our lord / that she was at lyberte
To serve him day and night / delivered from captivity.
Of the fervent devotion of saint Radegunde and of the great penance and
charitable warkes she used in religion.
WHat heart may think or tongue is sufficient
To express the virtuous of this moniall
In devout orison / in vigils convenient
In discret abstinence / in vestures small
Example gyueng unto her systers all
To the common people / how they in great virtue
Should daily increase / pleasyng our lord Ihesu
This abbasse used silde / to eat white bread
But of rye or berly / kept secretly
That no man perceived / how that she fed
Her drink was water or litell better daily
From her profession by saint Medarde truly
Her repast was potage / and herbis for to eat
Another fysshe / flesh / eggs / fruits / ne milk meat
Also after the usage / and rite of saint Germayne
She had a litell mylne in her secret cell alon
In which all the lenton / she labored certain
As would well suffyce for.iiii. days refeccion
A marvel how she did satysfy every person
Where nothing wanted / that was necessary
The more that was given / ever the more plenty
When obsruau^tes were done / each saturday at night
She took a lynen cloth cloused about her body
And washed the heedes of all poor folks aright
Rubbyng all their soris / sickness / and malady
She aided and succored / and did them remedy
After combyd them / or they passed the place
Nothing abhorring such mekenes in her was
To all poor creatures / the province round about
She ever ministered / the warkes of pytie
Gyuing to them clothyng / of alms without dout
Both lynen and wollyn / sytting for their degree
When they were grieved / with any infyrmyte
She took their vestures / and washed them echone
With her own hands / after did them upon
She send for poor folk / in her hall to dyne
Before the rich estates / for all their clothyng ryall
She served the said poor / after Christis doctrine
First water to their hands / with a towell to them all
To persons impotent / she ministered special
Wasshyng their mouths / their hands lovingly
Such was her custom / she was so full of pity
When all the service / on the table was set
She would stand fasting / to make them good chere
And deuyde their vitayls / as she might get
Showing them good counsel their soul is to lere
All blind / halte / and lame / to her were full dear
Whom with her hands / she fed with a spone
After gave them drink / with Christ's been sone
Women full of lepre and vile corrupcion
In arms she would embrace / and kiss swetely
And gave to them clothing / and refeccion
That many of them / were healed thereby
Wherefore it was said / O thou sweet lady
Who shall the kiss / or aproche the nere
Which kysses / such lepurs most vile in fere.
Of the great perfeccion / and penance that lady Radegunde used in the time of
lent.
THis noble Radegunde / and venerable abbasse
All the time of lent after her profession
When she solitary in her cell set was
She absteyned from breed / and costly refectio^
Using herbis / potage / made of malous alone
Without oil / and salt / except upon the sunday
She took bread alon / a little for that day
She absteyned so sore / from drinkyng of water
The.xl. days of lent / with such great penury
That she might not sing nor say with voice clear
The service of god / nor orison privately
She used the rough here / next her tender body
Watchyng all the night / vsyng meditacion
Her bed was dry ashes / and an here laid upon
Her clothyng was so poor / simple and small
She had not a sleue / upon her arms to do
But of her hoses / she made twain at all
To cover her from cold / from frost / and wynters woe
Thus she did punysshe / her propre body so
That she assembled a servant for to be
Rather than an abbasse of great auctorite
Also when her systers all in bed were laid
This lady Radegunde / would every night
Wype clean their shows like a poor maid
And with soft ointment anoyent them full right
Make all thing ready / again the day light
Of all vile labors / that among them there was
She would first serve most subget in the place
Wherefore as her course / came wekely about
She swepped all places / of the monastery
All great vile burdens / she bare them out
From streets and corners / fulsom for to se
Secret purgacions horible to the eye
She nothing disdayned nor was dismayde
On her childers to carry (in story as is said)
She humbled her self as lest in degree
Bearyng wod to the fire / in her arms twain
Seruyng her systers vexyd with infirmyte
Preparyng sustentacion / meat and drink certain
Wasshyng their fysnamy / and fedyng them plain
Sundry times kyssyng them with great humilyte
Thereby recoueryng diverse from penalite
Unto all people / she showed good lyberalyte
Truly fulfyllyng her holy professyon
Their fete and hands / wasshyng at the first enter
Of strangers to the place / desyryng them of pardon
Where was no offense / but all thing well don
Example gyueng / of meekness and charity
Unto all ladies within christente.
Of the great affliccion / and hard punysshement that ye lady Radegunde used
above the course of nature in the said time of lent.
THis noble princess maiden Radegunde
A comely queen / a moniall / an abbasse
A flower of virtue / a rose most rubicunde
Of our lord was elect / and circumfulsed with grace
To be ruler and lady / of a religyous place
Whose strayte herd penance / fame and holiness
We can not discrybe nor them express
This blessed abbasse / all the time of lenton
Suffered bitter penance / and marvelous punysshment
Usyng certain bands of yren in custom
Fast knyt to her neck / and arms in chastment
Also.iii. yren chenes / about her body went
Full straytely bound / the holy fast enduryng
To punysshe more pytiously her flesh freatyng
That when forty days of lent were past
And the maid minded to take them away
The said bands and chenes / remained so fast
Persyng her body that she ne might verray
Without great violence / remove them that day
That blood issued down fro the neck / to the fete
In diverse parties of her body full wete
She caused to be wrought for greatter penalty
A plate of coper / the sign of the cross having
Which laid in the fire / in her cell solitary
She took the said plate / as it was hot brennyng
And laid to her flesh / as a martyr sufferyng
Punysshyng her corpse to bring it in subjection
Obedient to the soul / by pain and devotion
This abbasse addyd new pain upon pain
In punysshyng her person / more grievously
For why all the lent (says the story plain)
Natwithstandyng her vigils / and abstinence openly
She exercysed new penance / and pains secretly
The here set with brystels / and yet she used more
A chafyngdisshe of coals / to be set her before
Thus when she was set / solitary in her cell
Her body quakyng / and her members all
Dredyng grievous pains / marvelous to tell
Her soul was armed / to suffer pain temporal
She broyled her body / with the said fire material
To anymat / and refresshe the soul in reason
To stand as a martyr / where was no persecucion
Hoote brennyng brass / she laid to her sides
Her tender flesh tremblyng / ye skin was consumed
The body was co^bust / with many grievous wondes
The flesh from the bones / in sundre parts divided
The blood semydecot to the earth distylled
Showing the verite / of the passion certain
Where scilence was kept / for all the grievous pain
Thus a fragill femynyn / for the love of Ihesu
Patiently suffered grievous punysshment
Usyng contynually / devotion and virtue
Prayer / almisdedes / and charitable fervent
Through which by grace / there followed incontinent
Miracles (for why) all vain pleasures transitory
Radegunde refused / myndyng most our messy.
How this holy abbasse vsyng meditacyon reformed her sister neglygent / with a
little exortacion following.
THis lady never spoke / again good conscience
She never defamed / nor used detraccion
Again verite / she never bare evidence
She never dissymuled / nor used adulacion
Hastynes / ne ire / debate / nor derysyon
She prayed for her enemies / to amend by grace
Mouyng her susters / to the same in the place
Great grauite goodness / and humilyte
True love to god / in her heart was fervent
Patience in aduersyte / faith / hoope / and charity
Justice attemperaunce / fortitude were lent
With prudence benygnite ever resplendent
Gostely example / with good exortacion
Had resydence in Radegunde / and holy religyon
Her example was better / than a commandment
Unto her subgettes / within the monastery
Her doctrine was profitable / and expedyent
By her fact and deed / she gave examplary
Unto her subgettes / and all the famyle
Her precepte and deed / agreed both in one
As Christ gave example / for our salvation
Also before mydnyght most commenly she said
All David psaulter / long before mattence
After when her systers / in bed were laid
She still continued / prayeng in presence
Of the blessed sacrementes / departed not thence
Till the day light / knelyng in devotion
With weeping tears / and meke medytacyon
That under license / and reformacyon
Of all them that this little work shall se
We purpose to rehearse / with deuyne proteccyon
Part of her miracles / following the story
Requiryng all reders / of their pure charity
To excuse my ignorant boldness also
And acccept mine intent simple tho it be
Quia bona voluntas / reputetur pro facto
This gracyous Radegunde / ceasyd day nor night
Princypally to praise our lord / with supplicacyon
Her mind heart / and mouth / with all her gostly might
Syngulerly was set her spouse Ihesu upon
As she was fervent / in her contemplacyon
A moniall Codegunde by a posterne preuatly
Passyd without license / out of the monastery
(Which thing known) thabbasse followed shortly
And would have called her by name Codigunda
Instead of which name / she said veraly
Come again dear sister (alleluya alleluya)
As the mind thought / so spoke Radegunda
Right so it fortuned / after many a season
Her soul was so fervent / upon meditacion
Sweet worthy princesses / borne of great rialte
Duchesses / countesses / ladies euerychone
Following your appetite / and sensualite
In worldly worship / and vain dilectacion
Diversity of garments made of their new facyon
With delicat dayntes repastyng every day
The body to conserve / in lust and likyng ay
Behold and considre with your interior eye
This humble abbasse / lady and woman
How she refused all wordly dignite
Richesse / reverence / and honor imperial
Uayne / vestures / garments / possessions withal
Entered religion / with great humilite
Truly obseruyng / the essencials three

Wherefore noble ladies / example ye may take
At this holy queen / all vice to forsake
O blessed Radegunde O worthy princess
Lady and queen / virgyn / and moniall

In a hiduous rage / alas the more pite
Thus she possessyd suffered mycle pain
The mind sore moved / alienat from reason

Frewyll was tollyd so was devotion
She had no power to say nor do truly
But as the said fend put in her memory
She was strayte bound / both foot and hand
For dread of myschefe / and wickydnesse
Her friends dwelling within the land

A breue conclucyon / and end of this poor translacyon mouyng the reders to
accept this little unworthy to be read.
Dear beloved brother / in our lord Jesus
My faithful lover / and special frynde
Glad I am to know your goodness and virtue
To whom with humilite I me reco^me^d
showing to you yt I have brought to end
And translate in to englisshe / the noble story
Of maiden Radegun^e as ye desired me
Requiryng you tenderly of your gentilnes
To accept this present poor translacion
Excusing my ignorance / and symplenesse
Taking my mind / and humble intention
Which warke is done / of no presumption
Also pardon my terms though they rude be
Frutles of sentence full of prolixite
Now to all poetis flouryng most eloquent
And to all other / that this life shall read or se
With humble submission / I do it represent
Desiryng them all / of their charity
To correct and reform it where is necessite
Which said translacion / and indigne work
Is for common people / written for no clerk
And where this virgyn / and gracious lady
Has be kept scilent and close a long season
Known to few persons / within this country
Therefore we purposed / under her proteccion
To declare her life and gostly conversation
Dilatyng her fame / and show her excellence
Extollyng her name with great magnificence
Every great estate / empress / queen / and duchess
Example may take at this moniall
To increase in virtue / and proved meekness
In church to be devout / and courtesse in hall
And to the poor people for to be liberal
Every true matrone her doctrine following
In heaven may be sure to have a wonnyng
And who so that is a person religious
May learn at this lady to keep patience
To be humble in soul / gentle and virtuous
Obseruyng chastity / and true obedience
With wilful pouerte / without concupiscence
And ever content be with what Jesus does send
yeuyng humble thanks unto your lives end.
Go fourth little book / black be thy vesture
As ever mournyng enable to come to light
Submit the also unto every creature
Which reason has desiryng to have a sight
O blessed savior / and lord most of might
Preserve this poor book from hate and enmyte
With all humble reders of thy benignite.
Amen.
