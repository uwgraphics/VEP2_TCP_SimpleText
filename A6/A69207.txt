portrait of William Caxton with printer's mark

WHere it is so that every humayn Creature by the suffran^ce of our lord god is
born^ and ordeigned to be subgette and thral unto the storms of fortune And so
in diverse and many sundry wyses man is perplexid with worldly aduersitees / Of
the which I Antoine wydeuille Earl Ryuyeres / lord Scales etc^ have largely
and in many diffirent manners have had my part And of hem releued by thynfynyte
grace and goodness of our said lord through the mean of the Mediatrice of Mercy
/ which g^ce evidently to me known and understand has compelled me to set
a part all ingratitude / And droof me by reason and conscience as fer as my
wrecchednes would suffyse to give therefore synguler louynges and thanks / And
exorted me to dispose my recouerd life to his service / in folowi^g his laws
and com^andeme^ts / And in satisfacco^n and recompense of myn^ Inyquytees and
fawtes before done / to seek and excecute ye works that might be most
acceptable to him / And as fer as mine fraylnes would suffer me I rested in that
will and purpose During that season I understood the Iubylee and pardon^ to be
at the holy Appostle Saint James in Spain which was the year of grace a
thousand.CCCC.lxxiij. Then I determined me to take that voyage and shipped
from southampton^ in the month of Iuyll the said year / And so sailed from
thens til I come in to the Spaynyssh see there lackyng sight of all lands /
the wind being good and the weder fair / Then for a recreacon^ and a passing
of time I had delight and axed to read som^e good historye And among other there
was that season in my company a worshipful gentylman^ callid lowys de
Bretaylles / which greatly delited him in all virtuous and honest things /
that said to me / he has there a book that he trusted I should like it right
well / and brought it to me / which book I had never seen before. and is
called the saynges or dictis of the Philosophers. And as I understand it was
translated out of latin in to frenshe by a worshipful man callid messire Iehan
de Teonuille provost of paris When I had heeded and looked upon it as I had time
and space I gaaf thereto a very affection. And in especial by cause of the
holsom^ and sweet saynges of the paynems / which is a glorious fair myrrour to
all good christian people to behold and understand. Over that a great comfort
to every well disposed saul / It speaks also universally to thexample. weel
and doctrine of all kings princes and to people of every estate / It lawdes
virtue and science / It blames vices and ignorance. And all it I could not at
that season ner in all that pilgremage time have leyzer to ouersee it well at my
pleasure^ what for the disposicions that belongs to a taker of a Iubylee and
pardon. And also for the great acquaintance that I fond there of worshipful
folks / with whom it was fittyng I should keep good and hoonest company / yet
nevertheless it rested still in the desirous favor of my mind / entendyng
utterly to take therewith gretter acquaintance at some other conuenyent tyme^
And so remaynyng in that oppynyon after such season as it lysted the kings
grace comaunde me to give mine attendaunce upon my lord the Prince. and that I
was in his seruyse / when I had leyser I looked upon the said book. And at the
last concluded in my self to translate it in to thenglyssh tongue / wiche in my
Judgment was not before. Thynkyng also full necessary to my said lord the
understanding thereof. And leest I could not at al times be so well ocupied or
should fall in ydlenes / whanI might / now and then I fell in hand with
all And drew both the sentence and the words as nygh as could / Nevertheless
I have seyn and herd of other of the same books which difference and be of
other inportaunce / And therefore I dread that such as should list to read the
translacon^ and have very intelligence of any of thoos books / either in
latyne or in frenshe should find errors in my work / which I would not
afferme cause of the contrary / But allegge the deffaulte to myn^ uncunning /
with the dyuersytees of the books / humbly desyryn^g the reformacon^ thereof
with mine excuse / and the rather syn after my rudenes not expert / I in my
manner followed my copye and the ground I had to speak upon / as here after
ensiewis.

SEdechias was the first Philosophir by whoom through the will and pleaser of
our lord god Sapience was understand and laws resceyued. which Sedechias
said that every creature of good believe ought to have in him sixtene virtues
The first virtue is to dread and know god and his angellys The second virtue
is to have discrecion to discrene the good from the badde and to use virtue and
flevices The thride virtue is to obey the kings or princes that god has
ordeygned to reygne upon him and that have lordship and power upon the people
The fourth. virtue is to worship his fadre and his modre The fyfthe virtue is
to do Justly and truly to every creature aftir his possibilite The sixthe
virtue is to distribute his alms to the pouer people^ The seuenthe virtue is
to keep and defend strangers and pilgrymes The eyghte virtue is to bind and
determine him self to serve our lord god The nynthe virtue is to eschew
fornicacion The tenthe virtue is to have patience. The enleuenth virtue is to
be stedefast and true The twelfthe virtue is to be peasible and attemperate and
shamfast of sin The thertenthe virtue is to love Justice The fourtenthe
virtue is to be liberal and not couetoux The fyftenthe virtue is to offer
sacrifices to our lord god almighty for the benefices and gracis that he
shows him daily The sixtenthe virtue is to worship god almighty and to put
him holy in his protection and defense for resistance of the in fortunitees
that daily falls in this world The said Sedechias said that right as it
apparteineth to the leptop to be subgect and obbeissant to the Royal mageste of
their king or pyrnce right so it behooves their king or prince to entende
diligentely to the well and governance of his people / and rather to will the
well of them than his own propre lucre. for by similitude right so is the king
or the prince with his people / as the saul with the body And said Sedechias
/ if a king or a prince enforce him self to gadre money or tresor by subtyl
exortacion or other vndewe means he ought to known he does amysse / for such
tresor may not by gadred without the sequel be to his danger or
depeopulacion of his Royaume or country

And said Sedechias / if a king or a prince be negligent and sloughful and take
no head to search and enquere the disposicion and workis of his enemies. then
tent will and dedis of his subgettys he shall not be long in surete in his royame
And said Sedechias the people is fortunat and happy that have a good and a
virtuous king or prince discrete and wise in sciences. And mykyl ar the people
infortunat when any of thyes things lak in their king or prynce^ And said
Sedechias if a king or a prince for slouthe leave to do any of the lytil things
that him ought / and is ordeygned he should execute lightly after he leueth
greter undone and so consequently he may lose all / right as a litil sickness
or hurt without it be sone and well remedied / may cause the destruction of
all the hole body. And said Sedechias if a king or a prince believe the fair
words and flateryngis of his enemies having no respect to their werkis it is
meruaylle but the said king or prince thereby suddenly take harm And said
Sedechias. It apparteygneth to a king or a prince to enfourme his sone in
virtue and science and how he shall gouuerne his land aftir him how he should
be rightwis to his people^ how he should love and haunte his knights not
sufferyng them to use to mykel huntyngis nor other Idelnesses / but instruct
hem to have good eloquence and to escheue all vanitees And said Sedechias It
apparteygneth to a king or to a prince. if he wol have any nygh servant first
to know his guydyng and conditions and how he gouuerneth him silf in his
house and amongis his fellawes. and if he understand him of good condition
and gounernaunce having patience in his aduersite reteyne and take him than
hardely. And ellis to beware of him And said Sedechias if thou have a verry
true friend that loves the well thou ought to take him more in thy love and
favor. than any of thy kennesmen desiryng thy death for to have the successions
of thy goodis

And said Sedechias commonely every resemblance delyteth other And said
Sedechias he that will not be chastysed by fair and sweet words. ought to be
corrected by sharp and hard correction And said Sedechias the grettest
richesse is satisfacio^ of the heart And said he is not rich / to whom
richesse lasts not / ne when they may be lightly taken away / But the best
richesse is that thing / that dureh perpetuelly And said Sedechias the
obeissaunce don by love is more ferme than that / that is done by might or
dread And said that experyence is a good chastisement And said the lokyng upon
the end of the work / if it be good^ yeueth hope to the benynnyng And said /
that good reno^mee and fame is right proffitable in this world / the deeds
thereof avails in the other world And said / it is better a man to hold his
peace than to speak myche to any ignorant man^. and to be a lone than to be
aco^payned with evil people And said when a king or a prince is evil tacched
and vicioux / bettir is to thaim that have no knowledge of him than to thoos
that be grettest masters in his house And said / bettir is awoman^ to be
bareyn^ than to bear an evil disposid or a wikked child And said / the
com^panie of a pour wieseman is bettir than of a rich ignorant that weneth to
be wise by subtilitee And said / he that offends god his creator^ by gretter
reason he fails to other And said bileue not in him that seith he loves and
knows trowth and does the contrary And said / the ignorante men wol not
abstyne them from their sensualitees but love their lif for their pleasaunce /
what defense so ever be made unto them. right as children^ enforce them self
to ete sweet things. and the rather that they be charged the contrarie^ but it
is other wiese with wiesemen^ for they love their lives but only to do good
deddis / and to leave Idelnesse and the delectacon^s of this world And said /
how may be compared the works of them that entende the perfection of the
good things perpetuel / to thaim that wol but their delices tra^sytory And
said that the wiese men bear their greues and sorrows as they were sweet unto
them knowing their trouble pacie^tly taken^ the end thereof shall be to their
merit And said that it is proufitable and good to do well to them thet have
deserved it And that it is evil done to do well to thaim that have not
deserved it / for all is lost that is yeuen unto them / right as the reyne
falls upon the g^uel And said he is happy that uses his days in doing
couenable things / and takith in this world but that / that is necessary
unto him and may not forbere / Applying him self to do good dedis and to leave
the badde And said aman ought not to be demed by his words / but by his workis
/ for comenly words ben vain / but by the deeds is known the harm or the
prouffit of every thing And said when that alms is distribute to pouer
indige^t people / it proffiteth as a good medicine couenably yeuen to them that
be seek / but the alms yeuen to the not indiget is a medicine give without
cause And said / he is happy that withdraws his ere and his eye from all
vile things And said / the most couenable dispense that any man may make in
his life / is hit that is set in the service of god / and in good workis^ And
the second is that is spe^ded in necessary things that may not be forborne as
mete drink clothing / and for remedies against sikenesse and the worste of all
is that is dispended in syn and evil werkis.

HErmes was borne in egypte^ and is as mykyl to say there as mercuri / and in
ebreu as Enok / which was sone to Iareth the sone of Matusale / the sone of
Malaleel / the sone of Caynan / the sone of Enoes sone of Seth sone to Adam /
And to fore the great flode / called Noes flode After that was there another
litil flode / which drowned / but the contre of Egipte only before the which
the said Hermes departs thens. and went through all lands till he was four
score year old and ^ij^ And with him had lxxij. persons of diverse tongues
which alweye stered and exhorted the people to obey our lord. and edified
Cviij^ towns which he fulfilled with sciences^ And was the first that fond
the science of scoles / and establisshed to the people of every clymat laws
couenable and apparteignyng to their opinions. to the which hermes the kyngis
in thoo days yaf great audience and obeissaunce in all their lands and so did
theuhitantis of the Isles of the sea he constreyned them to kepethe law of god
in saing truth to despise the world to keep Justice. to win the saluacon^
in the other world. he com^aunded orisons and prayers to be said and to fast
every wyke oon^ day^ to destroy the enemies of the law to give alms to the
pouer goddis people^ that is to say^ to the feeble and Impotent. he com^aunded
that porke flesh and camelys should be eten^. and such semblable metes^ and
com^aunded them expressly. that they should keep them fro pariury. he
stablisshed many festis at certain seasons. and ordeigned also diverse persons
to offer sacrifices at the rising of the sonne^ and some other at the first new
moone^ and at the conjunction ofthe planettes. and also when the planetes enter
in to their houses. and when they asc(...) and when they descended. The
sacrifices were of many^ things. that is to say of roses^ of flours of greynes
of whete. of barley^ of fruits. of grapes^ of licours^ of wynes. And the same
hermes said. that it was no Recompense sufficient^ to thank god only for
the g^ce he has sent us And said. O thou man if thou dre / dest god well.
thou should never fall in to the patthes that brings man to harm And
said. make not your clamours to god as Ignoraunces full of corrupt wilfulness.
and be not inobedient unto our lord god. nor trespassours to his lawe^ And
will noon of you do to your fellow. otherwise than ye would be don to. but be
concordau^t and love to gyders^ use fastyngis and orisons in pure and clean

he shall give remuneracion to the good for their goodness and punyssh the evil
for their wykkydenesse / And sayd^ ye be certain that the redemptour our lord.
is the gretest sapience. and the gretest dilectacion that one ought to have. of
whom all goodenesse comes / and by whom all the yatis of wit and
understanding ben opened And god that has loved his serua^tis has yeuen them
discrecion and has establisshed prophets and propheciers. and ministres
fulfilled with the holy ghost by the which he has manyfestely showed unto

wol appear And said constreyne you to amiexe the love of god and of your feith
unto sapience. and if ye do so all your life. it shall be to you agrete
profitable wynnyng^ and of that nobel virtue shall come unto you greter
benefices^ than if ye should assemble great gold and silver or other tresours

no foul words. for it is dishonneste and engenders hate. it is not
conuenyent for him that will have scyence^ to seek it by mede or for money^ but

said that king is good and noble / that causith in his Royame good laws to
be kept and mainteyned^ and the badde to be laid down And said largess and
liberalite is known. when a man is in necessite and pourete. and patience.
when oon has power to Judge and be avenged And said. he that worshipped the
wyese men loves Iustce^ and does good dedis. and enforces him to win
sciencis and good conditions and therefore he shall find that that likes him
in this world or in the other And seith. he is unhappy both here and there
that has wit and wol learn no science ne doctrine And said he that wol not
teache that that he vndersto^deth in science and good conditions. he shall be
partenar to the Ignoraunse of froward folk And he that denies to teache

largess is bettir in science than in richesse for the renomme of a wyseman
abideth^ and the richesses abides not. And a man ought not to offend nor hate

his own And said That great science prouffyteth litil to a covetous man But
litil science prouffyteth much to him that withdraws his courage from
couetise And said / That the lyff may be resembled to the fleyng of an arowe /
And the death is like the lyghting thereof And said / It is more merytery and
bettir to have pytie upon the fool than upon the worldely wyseman And said He

to have more And said / A reporter or a contryuer of talys comonely / other he
lies to him that he tells them / or he is false to thoos that he has seyde

and in his absence is his ennemy / and so shows him his friend by word. and
ennemy by deed And said / An envious man serves of noght but to disprayse all
otheer And said he is right sure that feleth him self withouten gilt / and is

/ he ansuerd / Ire and envy / after they axed him wherefore / the wiese man
stood more at yates of the rich man / than the rich man at yates of the
wiese man. And he answered. the wiese man knows the prouffit of the rich.
and the rich knows not the prouffit of the sciencial wiese man And said /
he that has wit and discrecion and knows it not indede resembles the tree
/ that bears no fruit And said. he is wiese that knows Ignorance and he
that knowith it not is ignorant / and he that knows not him self. how
should he know or deem another And said there be.ij. manner of men the oon^
seeks and can not find / the other finds and can not profit And said /
sapience is like athinge fallen in awatre. which can not be found. but by
them that wol search and fette it from the bottom And said with out chastity
/ aman can not be verry parfightly wiese / and without wit he may not be
parfight in science And said discipline is the ornament of wit. with the
which every man ought to enriche himself And said it is not honest to
chastise aman before all folkis / rather a part

And said when a man often^ excuses himself his known gilt. it causith his
error the more to be remembered And said^ the Ignorant person is but litil^
al be it he be old^ and the wiese is moche^ al be it he be young And the world
dispraiseth now adays thoos that afor it was wont to worship / and the earth
wastes and eteth them that afor it was wont to norysshe and feed And saide^
the fool is known by his wordis^ and the wieseman by his werkis And said
therbe few folkis envious of a deed man / but therbe many that wol lie upon
them And said be merry and glad and It suffyseth to anger the nuyous man / And
there was axed of the said hermes / why he married him not / he ansuerd / he that

swymmi^g And said keep the out of the company of a Iangeler which resembles
to a thing that seems good a far / and nygh It is right noght And said / He
that wolle do evil at thin Instaunce against another / Right so will he at his
Instaunce do against the And said / He that will preyse the of virtues that been
not in the / and thou rejoice hit / he may well allegge the vices that he seth
in the / And said / Ire troubles reason / and lets all good werkis and
furthereth all evil And said he that labors in that / that may not avail /
leseth therefore that / that might prouffyte And said the hurt and the trouble
that is don caused by evil people lettith the desire and well of the good And
said when thy friend erreth or mystaketh him against the. yet as much as thou
may depart not from his amytiee / but assaye the means to redress him And
said Wise kind and true is he / that will lightly foryete the error of his
friend And said / It is bettir chastyse thy self than let other do And said /
The goodenesse that comes of an Ignorant man / Is like therbys that grow on
a dong hill And said an evil felawe is like a tree kyndeled whereof the one
branche sets the other afiere

And said / The noblest thing that god has made in this world is aman / and
the richest thing to him is reason by the which he keeps justice and
escheweth sin And said the fool wol know in him self no vile thing and the
ignorant weneth lightly a thing be other than it is. and the suspectious. man
makes many doubts of that that he knows And said a Right recom^endable
thing in heaven and in earth is a true tunge And said. a king or a prince ought
not to give lorshippes nor auctorites^ but to good and merciable folks. And
therefore they should love them / as the fadre does his children^ And said it
should suffice aman and ought to hold him self reco^pensed when his adverse
party required of him pardon And it was axed him what was a liberal thing. he
said to give silver to unknown men for the love of the known men^ and to for
give them that have noied him / for the love of them that have holpin him And
said the life in this world is so short that there ought none conceive hate
nor will harm to other And said establisshe and ease thyn Ire. with thy
patience / thin Ignorance with thy sapience. thy foryetfulnesse. with thyn
remembrance And said it is a good sign / when a child is shamefaste / for
it shows he should have wit And said it is well don that thou do good while
thou art in prosperity for paraue^ture in aduersite thy power shall lak And said
he puttiz him in danger. that abides in a prounice / where there is no lord.
that woll venge the Injuries done thereto. where there is no Just Judge. where
there is no wise leche. where there is non habondaunt market. and where there is
no rennyng water And said it apparteigneth to every man with all his power to
seek science^ and there with to fortiffie him having a good eye upon his
enemyes^ and / beware he be not raised to high in pride by lordship or other
richesse^ his will his words and his dedis always to be egall / and so shall god
love him and his succession And said there may none escape to be at great day
of Judgment and his help shall be there by-iij^ things / Discrecion / chastete
/ and good works / All things may be left / Save good dedis / All
things may be changed / Save nature All things may be redresshid and
reformed / Save evil dedis. All things may be escheued / Save death / and the
sentence of our lord And said / It is no meruaille though he be good / that
is not covetous. But It weue great meruaylle / If a covetous man were good And
said The error of a wysemen may be resembled to a Crased ship / which in
drownyng her self / Drowneth many other And said / trust is in manner of a
bondeship / And mystrust is a liberte And the said Hermes correctyng king
hamon yaue him this precepte and charge / look that first affore all thingis ye
love / dread / and obey / our lord god And said all men that have dominacion
and lordship upon the people ought always of necessite / to have ^iij. things
in mind / First to remember the people / that be subgect unto him Secundely al
be it that they be in his servitude / yet ought he to his power to keep them in
fraunchyse and liberte and not in thraldom / Thirdely How his lordship and
power in this world may not long endure And said / o king hamon it behooves
the to keep thy saul / Right wisely in will and word / and thou ought not
to be slowthfull to the destruction of the myscreau^tes / but to constreyne

couetise / and your good astate shall dure. use Justice / and ye shall be
byloued and dredde^ keep not your body in great delectacions / for and ye so do
ye shall not con sustain the aduersites that might fall unto you. And he saw
an old man that was shamefast to learn. to whom he said Science is bettir in
age than in yought^ And said. If thou wylt dispreyse him. that thou hate.
show not that thou art his enemy And said. a good king or prince ought to
think diligentely to the state and guydyng of his lande^ and ought to ouersee
hit as often as a good gardyner does his garden And said hit behooves a king
to give example him self to keep hi^ laws / and se that his next kynnesmem and
friends do so after him and it apparteneth not to a king to be proud nor to do
aftir his own will only nor to ride couertely / nor in no derke night but

him If there were any difference to dye in their propre land orellis far
from thens / He ansuerd / whersomeuer one dye / the weye to the other world is
all like And said to a young man that would not learn in his youth / If thou
woll not take pain to learn thou shall have the pain to be lewd. and
uncunning And said god l^ueth thoos that be disobeissau^t to evil temptacion
And said / good praeyer is one of the best things aman may present to god /
and if thou axe him any boon let thy werkis be agreeable unto him

DYogenes otherwise called d^gly because he had some conditions of a dog /
and he was the wysest man that was in his days. He dispraised gretely the
world / and lay in a tonne / Which he turned for his auantage from the son
/ And the wind / as it pleased him / and therein he rested whansomeuer the
night f^l upon him / He ete whansomeuer he was hungered were it by day or by
night in the street or ellis where. without any shame thereof. And was content

self til his death. Sum axed him Why he was called dogly / he said be cause I
bark upon the fools and fawn upon the wysemen. Alexsandre the great came unto
him of whom he took little regard. he axed him why he set so litil by him /
seeing that he was so mighty a king and had no necessite / he ansuerd I have
noght to do nor set by him that is bondeman to my thrall. why quoth Alexsandre^

gretter in a mist than in aclere weder right so appears more his vice in his
Ire than in his patience And said to alexandre think not thou art the more
worthy for thy beauty. tresour and rich array / but only for thy liberalite

that thou use hit not thy self And sayde^ when thou see a dog leave his
maistre / and follow the. Drive hem a way. for right so will he leave the to go

/ thy peticion avails not / with out first thou pain thy self to learn it.
And sayde^ of all virtues of humanite / the greter quantite thereof is the
better save of words And said it is not honest to give praising to a man of a
thing that he has not deserued^ He saw a peyntour that was wax a physicien.
to whom he said thou know that men might se at the eye / the fawtes that
thou did in thy craft / but now they may not be perceived for they are

Astone upon a stone / One axed him What was loue^ He sayde^ It was Asekenesse

sekenesses come but of goddis will. He ansuerd Therefore am I the more aferd He
saw an old man that dyed his heeres To whom he sayd^ Thou may well hyde thy
white herres. but not thyn age And said. It is more behoofull. thou goo to the

the said dyogenes began to ete faster than be fore^ some axed him why he
herkened not the feyre seyngis of the gester / he answered. I do more
prouffitably than to harken lesyngys what is such praising worth. when he is
never the better therefore And said / if thou talk with a stranger speak not
to much / til thou have first made comparison between the connyng of his
science and thyn / and if thou find thyn better than his / speak the boldelier
and ellis hold thy peace and learn at him Diverse dylicious persons blamed him
of his manner of leuyng and he said / it lies well in my power if my list to
live afrer your giuse / but it is not in your power to live after my manner And
it was told him that certain persons had said evil of him in his absence

And said. it is achurlissh condition to answer dishonestely / and a noble
condition to answer pacyently And said / There is no greter tresour than
Discrecion and wit / Nor greter pouerte than Ignorance / Nor better
frendeship than good conditions / nor better guyder than Is good fortune And
said / Sickness Is the prison of the body^ And sorrow Is the prison of thy
saule^ There was Aman of great birth that rebuked him / To whom he said / My
blood and lynage is enhaunsed by me / and thyn Is hurt and loved by the

The said. Dyogenes was of litil speech / And one asked him Why he spoke no
more / He ansuerd There was great virtue in Amannys eeres There was aman said him
great uylanye to whom he said No word One asked him Why he ansuered not / He
said I could do him no gretter dysworshyp than he does him self For he has
contrybued blame unto him that has not deserved it One asked him / How he
should trouble his enemies. He ansuered Enforce thy self to be virtuous and
good. And If thou will. that thy goodenesse appear great unto strangers /
Repute to them thy self litil And said. If thou give power to thy wyff only to
trede upon thy foot on the morrow she would trede upon thy head And sayd^
Company of women Is an harm that can not be escheued And said. He that does
good for the goodenosse of hit only / ought not to dread before whom he does
nor for the praising ne blame there of One asked him when he should know his
friend / he said in necessite for in prospeperite every man is frendely There
was another man said vilanye unto him where at he took non angreIt was asked
him why he was so pacie^t he aunswred other has he said soth or lied / if he
have said troth / I ought not to be angry^ and yet less if he have lied. he
saw aman clater so much that there cowde no body make him hold his peace / to
whom he said / friend thou have ij^ eeres and but on tunge / wherefore thou
ought to harken double asmoche / as thou spekest^ he saw a fair young man
that deed great diligence to learn / to whom he said ye do passing well to
make your dedis assemble your beawte.

SOcrates in greeks tongue is to say / keeper of Justice he was married against the
custume of that country which was that good and virtuous people should be
wedded to gedres / to thentent that their lynage might be the better but he
wedded the worst woman that was in all the land and had.iij. children by her
/ he loved and worshipped sapience somuche / that it was a great hinderaunce to
all his successors / for he would not suffer his science to be written^ And
said that science was pure and clean / wherefore it was couenable / she should
be only set in mind and corrage and not in skynnes of deed bestes nor in no
such corrupt thingis / and therefore he made no bookis nor yaue no doctrine to
his disciples / but only by words of discipline / and that opinion he held
of Tunio which was his maistr for as the said Socrates being of te^dre age
axed his master / whywil ye not suffer me to write the doctrines that ye teache
me Tuino answered him couetest thou more the wild beestes / skynnes to be
worshipped with sapience / than thengyne of man I set the case that on mete
the in the wild feld / and axe the conseile upon a question. were it good that
thou should say / let me go home and over see my books first. It were more
honest to have a recours to thy remembrance and thereupon briefly to determyne /
It were so certainly said Socrates-wel then / reteyne it well in thy mind.
that thou shall lerne^ And put it not in thy book in which opynyn the said
Scrates rested / he defended that no man should worship false ydolles but would
that all honnour and worship should be referred to the creator of all thyngys.
and for that opinion he was conde^pned to death by ^xij^ Iuges of Athenes^
which ordeigned that he should drink certain poisons / whereof the king of that
country was sorry. but he cowde not revoke the sentence. he gaf him as long
respit of his Judgment as he might. The said king had a ship charged with
things that in certain times should be offered in the temple to the ydoles. he
had a custume that he would give no Judgment and especially upon man's death.
till the said ship were returned to athenes / which was not yet com home And
vpoon her com^yng home one of Socrates felawes called Inclites told him in the
prison / that the said ship should come to the port on the morrow or the next
day. wherefore he said. It were good that we should give.CCCC. pieces of gold to
thy kepers^ that they would b^ete the secretly escape and than myghtest thou go
to rome and nedest littill to dread them of athenes^ he answered. all that I
have is not worth four honderd. pecis of gold. no said Inclites^ I and thy
frendis have so much which we woll gladdely give thy kepers to save thy life
if it please the. to the which socrates answered this cite wherein I must
suffer death. is the natural place of my birth wherein I must dye without
deseruyng only by cause that I repreue hem from doing in just deeds / and for
worshippyng the false and vain ydolles and that I would have them honor the
true god. wherefore I say / If this men of my nation persecute me for
susteynyng and seeing troth / right so will strangers do whersomeuer I become /
for I wol never spare to say troth nor use no lesinges / and certainly thoos
would have less mercy of me than thoos of this town / where in I am born / It
happened that the therde day his disciples came unto him and fond him in
prison / by the commandment of the / xij / Iuges they axed him many dowtable
questions / touching the saul / he ansuerd them / as largely and as gladely as
ever he deed wher^f they merueylled to use so great constaunce in aman so nygh
his death / One of his disciples called Deman said maistre I know well / It is
an hard thing to the. for to show and teache us in the caas / that thou now
stand in and lakking of thy lore is to us adamegeous thing / for in this
world have thou no felawe of good doctrine / Socrates ansuerd. Spare not to
enquere of me what it pleases you for it is to me a great pleaser / they axed
him questions of the saul / which he ansuerd / and after they axed him of the
state of the world / and composicion of the Elementis which also he ansuerd
right perfundely / And he said unto them I trow the hour of my death approaches
nygh I will bayne me and make me clean in this world / and sey mine orisons to
thente^t that I shall have no pain after my death wherefore I pray you spare me
for a while / he entered to ahous and baigned him and said his oriso^s / and
than called his wife and childeren and gave them many feir doctrines and badde
them pain them for to do good adresse their saules to him that all created
and than came one from the Iuges to him with poison to drink And said O
socrates think not that I am he that makes the to dye / for I know thou art
the best man that ever came in this land / but I am sent from the Iuges for to
sle the / and here is the co^fection yt thou must drink take it pacie^tly
sithen thou may not escape it / Socrates said I take it with good heart / and
know well thou art not gylty thereof / and so drink it And when his fre^des
saw that / they made great weping and lamentacion whereof he blamed them seynig
I have sent a way the women by cause they should not do as ye do / he went
alitil from them / and said O god have mercy upon me / and anon his synewes
shranke his fete wexed cold / and than he leide him down / one of his
disciples took a boddekyn and prikked him in his feet / and axed him If he
felt any thing. And he said nay / than he prikked him in his thyghes / and
axed him if he felt it / he said nay. Anon the cold struck up unto his sides
than socrates said when the cold comes to my heart I must nedis dye Than
said Inclites O dear maistre well of sapience and of science correct and
teache us yet / while thy speech lasts to whom he said I can non other wiese
show you now dyyng than I have done before in my life The said Inclites said.
sir comaunde me what thing ye will. he answered noothyng. and lift up his eyes
to the sky seeing I present my soul to the maker of all the world and so dyed

The said socrates had.xij.M. disciples and disciples of his disciples. And
in his life he devised that men should be guyded aftre.iij. ordres that is to
say in Clergy / in knyghthode and in co^mones / and ordeigned the clergy
above the knyghthode / the knyghthode above the people and that the clergy
should pray for the knyghthode and the people the knyghthode should defend the
clergy and the people / the people to labor for the clergy and the knighthode
The said socrates was of read color / and of competent stature hoar heded /
and well faced / demure of speech / a great studyer and loker upon the earth /
and when he spoke he wagged his litil finger / he lived four score ^ij years /
and was written in his seal / patience and good believe in god makes aman
victorious / And was written in his girdel / having respect and consideracion
to the end of every thing causes the salvation of the saul and of the body /
he establisshed laws which were sent into the Eest / west / South / and North
/ and all was governed by them And said / the first thing that thou should fix
thy will in is to keep dyuyne Justice and to apply thy will to the same / and
not to do sacrefices nor no iniust things nor to swear no false oaths / And
said / right as a man is heled of his sickness / by virtue of a medycine /
right so is an evil man heled of his malice by virtue of the law And said to
his disciples I am a tilman / and virtues ben the seeds / and study is the
water that moisteth them / Wherefore if the seeds be not clene^ nor the water
sufficient. what someuer be sown profits litil

And said / one ought to merueile at him that forgeteth the perpetual
goodenesse of the other world / for the goods of this world that is not
durable And sayd^ the well disposed saul loves to do wele^ and the evil
disposes saul loves to do harm And said the good saul graffeth goodness
and the fruit thereof is salvation. And the evil disposed / graffeth vices / and
the fruit thereof is da^pnacion And said the good sawle is known by yt she
received gladly troth and the evil saul by that she receives gladly ^esynges

And said that when apersonne dowteth in dowtefull thingis and is steadfast in
thoos that been open and evident to the eye / it is sign that he is of good
understanding And said that the ^aules of them that been good / been sorrowful
of the werkis of them that been evil And said the man that follows couetise
leseth him self endelesly / and at the last is all dishonored And whoo that
hates it geteth enough / and at the end is right well worshipped And said that
the good sawle saves him self. and other ben saved by him And said the sawle
knows all things / and than he that knows his sawle / knowyth every thing.
and he that knows not his sawle / knows nothing And said he that is keytif
to him self / he is more keytif to another and he that is liberal to him self
/ is co^^onely liberal to another And said litil teching suffiseth to the
good sawle / and to the evil soul much teching may no^ avile And said
that.vj. manner of men be / that never be out of anger / that is to wit / the
first is he that may not forgete his trouble the.ij an eniuous man that
dwells with folkis newly enrichyd. the.iij. he that dwells in a place^
where another has thriuen and he can find^ no prouffit there. the ^iiij. a
rich man fallen in poverty. the.v. he that enforces him self to com to the
state that is not bylonging to him to have And the.vj. he that has dwellid
with a wyeseman / and has no thing learned of him And said who so payneth him
self to show doctrine to aman of evil courage / resembles to him / that wol
maistrie a strong horse / which if he give him not a strong bitte with a corbe
/ he shall nener con govern him And said to much haunting felisship
enge^dreth not great love bitwene them / and absteynyng from them ^auseth
ennemytees / and than it is best to dele therein moderately And said he that
does good is better than the goode^ and he that does evil / is wors than the
evil And said science is had by diligence of men / but discrecion comes of
god. And said wysdom is the leche of the law / and money is the sickness.
and when the leche may not hele him self / how should he hele another And
said thou may not be perfectely good if thou hate thyn ennemy / what shall
thou be than if thou hate thy friend And said this world may be liken^d to
away full of thistlles in a manner hid / where aman is prikked / that enters
in it / and if he aspie them he wol beware of it And said he that loves the
world / has but labor / and he that hates it / has rest And said he is
right si^ple that is certain to depart from this world / and besieth him to
make in hit his bildi^gis And said this world is like a light bre^ning fire /
whereof alitil is good to kyndyll his light to show him the wey / and he that
takes to much thereof may lightely bren him self with all And said he that
sets all his mi^de in this world / leseth his saul / and he that thenketh
on his saul hates this world And said he that loves this world may not
fail to fall in one of these / ij / inco^ueme^tis or both / that is to say /
other to displease our lord god orellis to be envied at of mightier men then he
is / And said aman that seeks to have enemies seeks his destruction / and
he that has many enuyers and enemies is in the danger of evil fortune And
said this world is but a passage in to the other world / and therefore. he
that purueieth him of thingis necessary / for that passage / is the surer for
all perils

And said trouble not thy self greatly / with wordely acquisicio^s / but
resemble the birddes of the sky / which in the morning seek but their
refection for that day and semblaby the wild bestes that com^e out of the
monteynes forto seek their fode / and at night repeire home again And said the
error is known in the end to be evil / and that that is good / is the more
clerly seen after thereby / Plato took upon him to go in a voyage and desired to
know of Socrates how he should govern him self therein / and he said dowte
the of thoos / that thou know / and beware of thoos that thou knows not /
and go not by night / ete noon herbs that thou know not / and look that
thou keep the highweye / though it be the longer / ente^de not to chastise him
/ that is out of all reason / for thou shall make him thereby thin e^nemy And
said lie not with a woman without necessite constrayne the And said two
things be laudable / that is for to say / law and sapience / law keeps
rightwysnesse / and sapience causith good conditions. Socrates acompained him
self with a Rich man. and they met thieves in an high way / the Rich man
said It were dan^gerous to me if they know me And socrates said It were the
better for me / If y were known by them And said awyseman ought to use his
days in one of these two maneres that is to seye. in that that may cause him
to have Joy in this world and in the other. or in that / that may cause him
to have good name in this world And said this world is delectacion of an
hour / and sorrow of many days / and the other world is great rest and long
joy / And said whosomeuer teache the one word of sapie^ce does the more good
/ than if he gafe the of his gold And said swear not ly our lord / for no
manner of lucre al be it thy cause be true / for some wol think thou forswerest
thy self And said take heed how thou yeuest thy yeftes / for some si^ple
folks give to the vnnedy / and refuse hit to thoos that have need And said If
thou will wi^ne afrende / speak good of him for go^de speech enge^dreth love /
and evil speech engenders hate ^^^d And said a king ought to put from him all
evil disposed persons for the harm that they of his company do is reputed
his deed And said he that erreth and knows hit. and after repents him
thereof has deseruid pardon And said he that medleth to correct every man
causes the most part to hate him And said to a man that had reproved his
lineage / If I be the worse for my lineage as thou say thy lineage is the worse
for the And said he that seeks the delices of this world is like unto him
that seeks to drink zarab wenyng it were water and re^neth to drink it til he
be weary / and when he comes to hit. he finds no thing and than he is more
thristy than he was before / for zarab is a mist in a medew / which at sometime
by reflection of the son seems a water and is none in deed And said a man
has never perfyte rest and Joy in this world / for he can not al way
persevere in delectacion and possess his winningis and often has trouble and
angwysshe / aswele for loss of his fre^dis as otherwise / And said the love of
this world stops man's eeres / from hering sapie^ce / and blynfildeth the
eyes from seyi^g troth. and hit causith also aman to be envied and keeps him
from doing good dedis And said he that loves and uses troth has moo and
greter seruauntis than a king And said he is not free that byndeth him to
another And said afferme no thing / til thou know the troth nor do
noothing. but it be couenable nor begi^ne nothing / but if thou se h^we to
bring it to good conclusion / There was a rich man said to him / O s^crates
why art thou so pour / To whom he ansuerd If thou knew what is poutee /
thou would have more sorrow of thy pouerte than of mine And said It is a great
merueile to se a wyseman angry. And said the death is a thing that may not be
eschewed / and t^^^r ought none to dread hit / but such as have committed
great iniqinte and don litil justice / wh^rfore they should dread da^pnacion for
their demerites after their death And said good death is not to be despised / but
to be magnified and preysed for it makith tra^smutacion from the world of
vncle^n^sse and shame to the world of worship^ from the wo^ld not durable to
the world perpetuel / from the world of folly and vanites to the world of
sapie^ce reason and troth And fro the world of traueile and pain to the world
of consolacion and rest And said / It is merueile of him that dowteth to dye /
and does things contrary to his salvation And said death is lyffe to him that
knows to have joy after it And said he that lives well shall die well / And
said better it is worshipful death than shameful life. And said death is the
rest of covetous people for the le^ger they live the more multyplie their
couetises. and so death is more couenable / for them / than life / for the death
of evil people is the well and furete of the good Because they shall do no more
sin nor hurt to the people And said the life Iugeth inderectely amongis the
deed And said. one ought not to weep for him that is slain without cause. but
for him that has slain him / for he that sleeth unjustly / dampneth him self
And said he that dredeth any thing / ought to his power to beware thereof Also
he that dowteth to have peines for his sins aftir his death. ought so to dele
/ that he may escheue that parell And said when thou wolt do any thing look
for what occasion hit is And if thou see the end thereof good / haste the
conclusion^ and ellis resist thy will And said bettir is to aman to live
hard. than to borowe of him that reputeth his litil lones and yeftes to be
great and without cause wol think aman to be in his danger And said take in
no preisyng the lone or yeft of him that has disworshipped the for the
dishonor and shame thereof is more than the wynning He loved alwey to learn /
whereof some rebuked him^ to whom he said / the grettest shame / that can come
to an old man is to be ignorant / he fond a young man that had folisshly
spent and wasted his substance and was brought to such pouerte^ that he was
feyn to ete olyues / to whom he said if the olyues had be as good to the at
the beginning / as they be now. thou should have had yet largely of thy
goods And said there is no difference bitwix agrete teller of tydyngis. and a
liar And said the noblest thing that children may learn is science / for
thereby they eschew to do evil werkis And said the gretest wynnyng that aman
may have / is to get a true friend / he herd aman say that one was surer in
keeping his tunge / than in much speking / for in much langage one may lightly
err. To whom he said one ought not to understand that in them that speak
well. And said the proffit of silence / is less than the prouffit / of
speech. and the harm of speech is more / than the harm of silence^ And said
one may know a wyseman by harke^yng and holding his tu^ge. and aman may know
a fool by his much clateri^g. And said he that wol not hold his peace til he
be constreyned is not to be blamed and he that will hold his peace til he be
boden speak is to be preysed. And said It is an ignorant thing to dispute in
things yt may not be understand / And said the mean is best in all things.
And said much re^ning makes much werinesse. And said if the wit of a man
oumaistrie not his frailte / he shall sone be overcome and brought to naught And
said he is abeest that can not discern the good from the evil And said he is a
good friend that does the good / and a mighty friend / that defe^deth the from
harm. he wrote unto a king reco^forting him when his sone was deed in this
manner / god made this world an house of delectacion and reward and the troubles
in this world causen remuneracion in the other / And said no man ought to

as we keep our self from the multitude of metes for the health of our body / we
ought by a great reason to abstein us from vices / for the sauacion of our
saules And said he that adds to his gentilnesse noblesse with good manners
and conditions is worthy to be praised. And he that takes and suffiseth him
conly / with the gentilnesse that comes to him by his kynred / without
purchassing any other virtues. ought not to be called good / nor to be hold
noble And said / if thou feel thy self more true to the king / than other ben /
and that thy wagis ben like to theires or less / yet thou ought not to
complain thereof / for thin ar lasting / and so are not theires And said / If
any have envy at the / and by envy says evil of the / Set not thereby /
and thou shall have peace with him / for he seeks not but for to have noise
with the And said men ought to keep well their halidayes / that is to wit
principally from evil doying And said / the more that thou art exalted in high
astate the more thou ought to be meke and curteise to the people to the end /
that their love may abide with the / if any thing should befall the. other wise
than well And said o^nneth may aman keep the love of his fre^des / if he wol
correct him rudely of his faults And said a wyseman ought for to chese good

ARistotle by interp^tacion in greeks tongue / is fulfilled or complete of
goodenesse / And he was sone to Nichomacus / the which was right connyng in
fisike and a good fisicien / and was boren in the Town of Stagree / and he was
of the kindred both by his fadirs side / and by his modirs side of Esculapius of
the which here byfor has bemade mention for he was in his time the most
excellent And the best of all the greeks / and when the said aristotle
was.viij. years of age his fadir putted him in the cite of Athenes that than
was called the Cite of wysdom. and there he learned Gramare Retorike and other
books of poetry. And therein he studied / the space of.ix. years prouffyting
gretely therein / And in thoos days men set much store by the foresaid
sciences and was their opynion that itwas the laddre to go up into all other
sciences / And certain other wise men at the same time as Pytagoras and pytoras
and diverse other reputed and held the said sciences for no sciences and did but
moke and scorn them that learned them / Saying that such science as Gramare
Retorik and poetrye / were not couenable to come to any wysdom / And that
Gramare is not but f^r to teache the childeren / Poetrye but for to tell fables
and to make lesynges / Retorike for to speak fair and in terms. And when
Aristotle hard th^s words he had great merueyle thereof / and was gretely
agreued with such as held the same opynyon^ And strength him after his power
to sustain all manner of Gramaryens the poets and also the Retoriciens And
said pleinly that Sapience can not excuse her of the said Sciences for Reason
is an Instrument of wit. as It appears openly^ that knowing of any thing is
to use of Reason / and this prerogative / which god had yeuen to men is right
noble and whorthy. to thentente that amongis the men he should be holden for the
most Noble and most wise that more uses of reason. And that better and more
couenably receives in his heart thynges^ And tells hem in place. and time
couenable. And for as much as Sapience is most noble of all other things
she ought to be declared by the best rayson and couenable manner and by the
most pleasamit and short words that can be don without error or letting the
sentence for (...) the reason be spoken inparfeitely the name of wisdom if lost
thereby / and so is the speker in fawte / And so the herers resten in dowte of
the sentence / And aftir that aristoteles cowde the sciences abouen said he
learned of plato in aplace Called Epidenie Ethikes and the.iiij^ sciences
theolegikes / and at that time he was.xvij^ years of age / and when plato went
the second time into Cecile / he left Aristotiles in his place in the said
town of Epidenie / In the which he taught the science and learned it and after
the death of plato the king phelipe of macedoyne sent for aristotilles which
went to him in macedoyne and there dwelled with him during his lyff teching
contynnally the said science and aftir the death of king phelippe Reigned his
sone Alexandre the great And when Alexandre departed from macedoyne for to go
into the Country and region of daise thoo returned Aristotill to athenes and
there he dwelled ^x. years studying til that he becam asouuerain clerk / and
apreest accused him by envy to the Citezins telling hem that he worshipped not
their ydolles like as other people did at that time whereof aristotill was
advertised and hastily departed fro Athenes and went into ye town of setagire
where he was borne fering that they of Athenes would have don to him as they
did to socrates if he had dwelled longer with them And he ordeigned aplace in
setagire where he held and kept the scoles yeuing many good in structions to
the people And occupied the time in good deeds. And yaue great almesdedis to
pour people. and married many pour children that were fadir and modir lees and
he taught benignely all tho that would study what astat or nation that ever
they were of / and ediffied and bilded new again the said Cite of stagire and
therein ordeigned lawes^ and yaue instructions to kingis and princis which they
took and kept right reuerentely^ and aftir he deyde in the age of ^lxiij^
yeris^ they of Stagire took his bonys and right worshipfully put hem in a
shryne where they held their counscile for his great wit / and also for the
great and fervent love that they had to him^ and as often times that they
had ado any great matere for to have the declaracion therof^ the men which
were of counscile would go and stand as nigh the said shreyne where the bonys
were as they cowde for to have knowledge of ye troth of their matere. and thus
they did for to worship him the more. and their opinions and verry trust were
for only being nygh the said shryne their wits should be the bettir and
their understanding more pure and subtle. And the said Aristotill had in his
time many kings sons that were his disciples^ and he made in his days well an
^C. bookis of the which we have now.xxviij. in logike.viij. in nature the
book of Ethik the book of politik the book of Methafisike^ that is named
theologike and the bookis of the wits of goemetrie / and platon rebuked him
because that he wrotte his sciences in bookis / to whom he said in excusing him
that it is athing known and notified ynowe. that all thoo that loves science
ought to do nothing that should cause the loss of her^ And therefore It is good
to compose and make bookis by the which science shall be learned / and when our
memory shall fail it shall be recovered by mean of bookis for he that hates
science shall not proffite in hit though it be so that he se the bookis and
biholde hem yet shall he set not by it / but depart wors and less wise than
he was a fore. and I have made and ordeigned my bookis in such form that the
wise men shall lightly and aisely understand hem but the ignorant men shall
have but litil avail by hem And the said Aris^otiles held gladly in his hand
an Instrument of the science of the sterres And said to king Alixandre he that
has in this world good and laudable name and the g^ce of god ought to ask ne
desire non other thing And said thus to him / direct thy self first for if
thou be not just how may thou well direct thy peole. and if thou be in
error thou can never govern hem well / for a pouer man can not make another
rich / he that is disworshipped can not worship another / he that is right
feeble may not help another / and so may not goodely ne well any man direct
another. but if he dyrecte him self first. And therf^re if thou wol take of the
filthes from other / cleanse thy self first / or ellis thou shall be as the
leche that is seek and can not hele him self and traue^leth to hele other that
have the same sickness And said It is a great chastisement to the people to
have a right wys lord. And It is a great corrupcion unto them to have a
corrupt and mysruled king And sayd^ keep the fro couetise for thou ought to
think and remember well that It is not laudable thing to have rychesses in this
world. and shame in the other seying that this world is no more but only
abaytyng place for to go to the other world And said / If thou wol be rich
suffice the with such as thou have / for he that has not suffisaunce can
never be rich what goods that ever he has And said If it were so that by
evil doing It should fortune the to have some good / and by well doing to have
some harm / yet eschew the evil orellis thou shall be deceived at last and
euir do well and at last thou shall be remunered therefore And said / such
thing as thou praises upon thyself blame it not upon another. and do nothing to
other / but as thou would it were don to the / refrayn thyn own will / and
hate not other men / be not envious / and have him not in Indignacion that has
offensed the / for no man can sometime eschew error / be not covetous / for
couetise lettith the man's reason / and takes aweye the knowledge of troth /
do not vncouenable werkis / take compaynie with wise men and study in their
bookis / fle l^singes / for the liars lies not but for unknowing of reason and
of her saules / the lest harm that can fall to alyer / is that no man bileueth
him of nothing that he says / neuirthelesse man may bettir be ware of a theffe
than of alyer And said the hertis (...) good people accords togiders / like
as renni^g watre with the watre of the sea. and the hertis of evil people can
not lightly accord / all be it that they be togidres / as the unreasonable
bestes that play and lepe togidre and suddenly fall to fighting And said /
ordeigne that your offices and auctoritees ben yeuen to them that loves and
follows troth and rightwysnes and cause them to have rigorous peynes yt ben
harmedoers and loves falshode and desepcion And said / If ye have dowte in any
thing counseile you to wysemen and if they dispraise you thereof be ye neu wroth
therefore / and if aman has some vice and beside that has many virtues ye ought
not therefore to let to ask him co^seile And said many man shall both let
and trouble the that can not help the And said Justice is a mesure the which
god has ordeigned upon the earth by the which the feeble is defended from the
mighty / and the true from the untrue And said the wyseman knows what
ignorance is in as much as sometime he has been ignorant but the ignorant was
never wise and therefore he knows not what is wysdom And said to Alexa^dre /
there be many litil besinesses in thy royame and many great and general and if
thou give pouoir to any person upon the great / and thy self to occupy the
litil thou shall well wit and perceive that great damage shall thereby fall to
the in time coming / if it falls not sonner And said liberalite is to give to
nedi people or to him yt has deserved it / so that the gift be aftir the
possibilite of the yeuer for he that yeueth over reas^n ought to be called
waster and not liberal And said sapie^ce is the defense of the saul and
myrrour of reason wherefore he is right blessed that traueilleth to have her for
she is the fo^deme^t and ye root of all noble deeds and laudable thingis and
by her we may wi^ne the good end and keep us from pain everlasting And said O
alexandre if thou use thy pouoir and lordship other wise than thou ought to
do^ thou shall be envied / of envy shall com lesingis / of lesingis shall com
Injustice and ennemytee / of Injustice and ennemytee shall com bataile. and by
bataylle the law shall be perisshed. the people hurt. and thy possessions lost^
But if thou vse^ thy lordship as thou ought to do^ troth shall encresse in
thy Royaume. of troth shall come Iustice^ of Justice love / of love great
yeftis^ and surety by the whiche^ the lawe^ the people and thy good shall be
maynteyned and encrece And said he that makes his Royaume servant to the law
shall reign / and he that takes and put out the law from the royame shall
not reign And said. A king ought to be of good and strong courage / to
remember well the end of the werkis / and to be courtoys and fre^ and to
refrayn his wrath where it apparteigneth and show hit where it needs / to keep
him from couetise / to be true to govern him as nygh as he may aftir his good
predecessors to give to his men as they have deserved. to deffende and keep
the law and the feith^ and euir to do well aftir his might / and if the
strength of his body fail him then to keep the might of his courage / by the
which he shall be the more assured in all his nedis And said the king that
governs him and his roaume well by his wysdom Is worthy to be greetly praised
and lauded And said to Alexandre / seche to win the richesses that be not
tra^sitories. the life that is not moeuable the kingdom that can not be taken
aweye from the. and the eu^rlasting Joy. and be pitefull but not somoche that
thou stand in daungier thereby / do pugnicion and Justice to thaim that have
deserved it without delay trauaille the to fortiffie the law for in that is
the love and dread of god. and when thou shall be compelled to take ve^geaunse
of thyn e^nemy put it not over til another day for the fortune. and condicio^s
of this wrolde moeue and change oft^^tymes sodaynely And said thou ought not
to hate him that says the sothe nor to chide him that keeps the feithe but he
that shall do contrary to the feithe be thou his ennemy with all the power of
thy royaume And said It is bettir that thou correct thy self and amend the
aftir the exemple of thy predecessors / than thy successors should amend hem
aftir the exemple of the And said worship the good men and thereby thou shall
have the love of the people and set not al thy will in this world in the
which thou may not long abide And said worship sapie^ce and fortiffie it
by good maistris disciples and scolers / worship hem pay for their expencis
and keep hem of thy household / aftir that thou shall se they shall be prouffyted
and sped in the science And thou shall find that great prouffyt and worship
shall com to the therefore And said he is of bygge and strong courage of good
discrecion and laudable feith / that bears pacientely all his aduersitees for
a man can not be known in his prosperyte And said thou ought to think that
the wekest of all thyn enemies is stronger than thy self And said thou ought
to cherisshe thy knightis and thy yomanry / and to have hem in as great love in
time of peace as in time of werre / for if thou set litil by them in time of
peace / they shall forsake the when thou shall have more need of hem And said
the grettest prouffyt that thou can do in thy royame is to take aweye the
wykkid people / and to reward the good And said a man is of evil condition
that takes no head but to the vices and fawtes of other in dispreysing of them
And said worshipful death is bettir than shameful liff And said the sapie^ce of
a man of low degree is worship and the f^lie of him that is of high degree is
ashame and avarice is the thing that takes awey the name of gentilnesse And
said the good prince ought to goune the people as his good p^decessours have don
and to love and cherisshe the good and true people more than his tresour or
other wordely goods / and to delight him in that / that he has rightwysly /
and not wrongfully And said no man ought to be asshamed to do Justice / for if
the king be not iusticial he is not knig but he is violent and rapax And said
the wikkid men obey for dread / and the good for their goodenesse And said
men ought to do well to the good people and to chastise the wikkid by rigor And
said wrath ought not to be to sharp ne to sweet / and he wrotte an epistoll to
Alexandre / that the kings been worshipped for ^iij. things that is to wit
for instruction of good laws / for conquestes of lands and regions and for to
peoplishe and distroye deserts and wildernessis / and he wrotte also to
alixa^dre that he should not be willing to correct all me^nes fawtes to
rigorousely for it lith not entierly in man's power to keep him from doying
evil / and therefore it is good sometime to foryeue errors and if it be so that
of need pugnicion must be don / men ought to show that theydo it by co^pulsion
to amend and pugnisshe the errors and not in manner nor by weye of ve^geaunce
/ and he saw a man that had his hand smytten of for theft that he had don
And he said for asmoche as that man had taken from other such as was not there
own men have taken from him yt / that was his And said thou may not so well
cause thy people to love the as to cherisshe hem and show hem right wysenesse /
and if thou do the contrary though thou have the lordship of their bodies
thou have not the lordship of their hertis ne of their courages / and that
shall thou find when thou call upon their seruise at thy need wherefore it is
a great da^gier for aching to do injury and do make his people hate him And said
he is right happy yt can chastyse him self taki^g exemple by other / And said
fortify your saules with good deeds and depart you from couetises which
distroyeth the feeble corages There is nothing that makes aman l^sse to be set
by / than to preyse and boste him self of his good dedis And it was axed of
him what is the cause that wisemen wol not be wroth and any man wol teache hem.
And he ansu^rd for asmoche as wysemen known that science is a right
proffitable thing / And said he that wol not nor can not do well at lest
ought to keep him from evil doyi^g / And said to his disciples look that ye
have / iiij / eeres / ij / for to h^rke^e and learn sciencis and proffitable
thingis / and the other / ij / for your other wordely besinesses The most
profitable thing to the world is the death of the evil people. And said a man may
not be so well known / as in great auctorite / And said in all thi^gis the
lest qua^tite is the lighter to bear sauf only in sciences / for he that has
most thereof the lighter may bear it / And it was axed of him what was the
most couenable thing for a discrete man to have / And he ansuerd that / that
should abide with him if he were ascapped out of a drowned ship in the sea / And
said men ought to love to learn the best of the scie^cis as the bees love the
swetest of the flowers / and he had a noble and worshipful heritage of the
which he let other have the gouna^ce and would not go theder him self / And it
was axed him the cause / And he ansuerd that. he that oftenest goth to se his
heritagis has more displeasirs / And said the tongue of a fool is the key of
his secret / And said to one that was slowthfull and would not learn / sithen
thou wol not take the pain for to learn. thou shall have the pain to be lewd
and vnco^nyng. And said keep the from the feliship of him that knows not him
self Tho that been daily inclined and utterly disposed to vices may not
encresse in good ne proffyte in science. And said if thou wol habandone to thy
body al his will thou shall be the worse both in health and in all other thinges^
and at last thy saul shall be dampened therefore He that is entierly enclynd to
do fornicacion may not be praised ne come to good end / And said a merry man
wol not lightly be wroth / A li^beral man may not well be envious / ne a
covetous man content with his richesse. And said the man is preued and tried by
his werkis as the gold by the fire. One of his disciples made to him an evil
raport of one of his felawes. to whom he said I wol not believe thyn evil wordis
against thy felawe nor I will not believe his evil words against the / And said
like as the rayn may not proffite to the corn yt is sawen upon the dry stones
/ no more can studieng avail to a fool A man's tongue shows his wit or his
folly Experience ought to correct a man and to help him to live well / And
said sapie^ce makes richesse to be fayer and hydeth poutee / It was axed of
him what was fayer speking And he ansuerd to speak litil and laudably and to
give reasonable answeres^ and he wrote thus to alexandre / ye be a noble and
mighty king and more mighty than ye were and shall encrece if ye direct and
govern well and justly your people / and in so doing the people shall obey you
/ but if ye be an extorcioner and take al their good from them than ye shall be
lord of the pouer people and than shall ye be like him that has lever goune the
doin beestis than the men / ne there is nothing so couenable to aching as to
coueyte unduly the goods of his people And said he that has alitill of
troth desires to have more / And said reason makes aman to be more
souuerain than be^stis and he that has no reason is but abeeste in many
things the newest is the best / but love is contrary / for the elder it is
the more it is worth / and one Abrakyn lord of sciences axed him what thing
aman ought to learn first that seeks sapience / to whom he answered the
government of the saul / In asmoche as she is everlasting and more noble
without any comparison than any thing that we have / Than they axede him how
may the saul acquere sapience / and he answered as a seek man seeks his
fisicien and as ablynde man enquereth of the colors to them that se hem / and
it was ax^d of him / how a saul might se her self / and he answered the saul
that lakketh sapience can se nothing as the eyes with out light that nether se
hem self nor other And said all manner of things have propertes / and the
properte of discrecion is to chese well the good from the evil And said the
lordshippes won by study dangiers and peynes and so kept / ought well to
contynne and prospere- And thoos yt be lightly wo^ne and kept in Joy and
plesaunce / comme to alittill prouffyt at last / and we se co^monely the
towns wherein the inhabitauntes take great labor be well maynteyned and
encresse with great richesses / and the towns full of pleasaunce and delices
full to ruin and destruction And said hastiness of speech makes men to err
And said I merueille how he ye men lawde without cause accept it and is
pleased with all / and he of whom men say evil without cause is angry with all
And said look that thou be not as the bulter which castith the flower and
keeps the brenne And said men ought not to take the gouerna^ce of the people
to a child to him also that can not know the nedis of the pour people to him
that is covetous / to him that will work without deliberacion / ne to him that
is ve^geable And said there is no difference bitwix a child of age and a child
of maneres as of condition what age that euir he be of for the condicio^s of
men aren known and showed by dedis and not by age And said It is nedeful to
aman if he wol be good that he be able of him self to know troth and do it in
deed orellis that he learn hit of other / for he that of him self can not
understand hit nor will learn hit can not be good And said goodenesse is
divided in / iij / maneres / the first is in the body / the second in the
saul. and the therde in the operacions whereof the most noble is the
goodenesse of the saul for in vsi^g the virtue thereof / is fond and known
the form in good dedis And said aman finds sapience and good condicio^s in
long lernyng of very scie^ce^ And said there be many persons that known the
good werkis and do hem not which rese^bleth the seek folkis ye axe help and
conseill of the leche and do no thing theraftir / and therefore the bodies been
without health and the saules without blessidnes^ And said one may know the
inward disposicio^s of aman by his outward operacio^s. And said well doing is a
laudable thing / neuthelesse it is somewhat hard to do but lightly one may do
evil as an archier to fail of the butte is no wonder / but to hytte the prike
is agreet maistrie^ And said in diverse manner we may be evil but we may not be
good but in one wey / And said default of wit causes many harms and makes
many men to fall by ignorance Not knowing what thing to be don or left And said
Aged folkis louen togider / and so do not childeren for old folkis have their
delectacions like and young folkis in diverse weyes And said agrete aco^plissing
of me^nes felicite is to be well frended than aman whitout felisship can not
have hole felicite And said every man has need of frendis / whether he
stands in good caas or in badde / if he stands in evil condition / they
for to help him / and if he stand in good caas / he to make merry him and
cherysshe them that they may help him to resist inco^uenientes that might
fall And said noon has delectacion in justice / but the just man / none has
favor to sapie^ce but the wysema^ and noon loves frendeship but the true
friend And said the wikkid men sustain their perilles by their bodily strength
and the good men suffer their perilles pacientily by the virtue of their saules
which patience comes not by might of arm nor of hand nor nonother member /
but only of grace of the saul / and thereby to resist aeynst couetise and
other grieves of this world trusting therefore aftir to come to bliss / and he
wrote to king alixa^dre in this form / thou ought to obey well the
co^mandeme^tes of god / for he has give the thy desires / and all that thou
have axed of him And said sapie^ce is life and ignorance is death and therefore he
yt is sapie^t is a live / for he understands what he does and he yt is
ignoora^t is deed for he understands not what he does And said the a^tiquite
of the time makes the werkis old / and bydeth no thing but reno^me which
rests in the hertis of the successors it is nedeful than to conquer good
renommee and thereby shall endure noblesse And said lesi^g is the sickness of
the saul which can not be heled but by the mean of reason which lies never
And said Amoche wyseman is he that pronounseth not the things into the time
that he is present that wol understand hem. And the best speker is he that
speaks not til he is well purueyed what he shall say. and ye bestwerkeman is
he that begi^neth not his work into the time that he has well disputed and
auised it. in his heart Nether is none that ought to have somoche thought as
the wyseman. for it is necessary to him to be purueyed and certain of his
werkis And said men are more inclined to couetise than to reason. for couetise
has acompaigned them from their childehode. and reason comes not to them til
that they be of parfyte age And said. the children hate their maistres when
they teache hem for they know not what good may befall them therby^ but think
only the labor of the pain of their lernyng And the said Aristotel^s callid
Alexa^dre axing him questions upon the gouerna^ce of the lordis and of the
people. to whom alexandre yaue good answeres^ But never the less Aristotiles
beet him with a Rod. And It was axed of him why he had beet him without cause.
And he ansuerd this child is like and able to be a great lord and a mighty
king. And I have beat him all only for to hold him lowly. and in meekness
for he shall be to soon proud And said If thou can direct another. direct him
as thy self. And a young man axed him why he was so pouer / To whom he ansuerd.
My pouerte has nothing offensed me / ne does me no harm But thyn has done
the and shall do harms ynowhe

And sayd^ The Royaumes ben maynteyned by the laws ordeigned by the king and
princes And said the kings and princes ben sustained and uphold by knighthode
/ And the knyghtis been maniteyned by money / and money comes of the people /
and the people is governed by Justice without which no Royaume may prospere

ALexander the great was sone to phelip king of macedone / which phelip
reigned.vij^ year / And the said Alexander began to regne in the.xviij. yer of
his eage / And he said to his people in this wise / Fair lords I will in no
wise be contrary to your wylles ne to your deeds / But I show to you that I
hate frawdes and malices / and as I have louid you during my faders life / so
will I do in time coming And I both counceylle and pray you that ye dread god
obey him as souerayn of all / And chese him for king / and be most obeyssant
to him that shall best pouruye for the good astate of his people / and that shall
be most debonayr and mercyful to pour folks / that best shall keep Justice /
and the right of the feeble against the mighty / him also that shall best dispose
for the publyke well / and for no delectacion of worldly pleasa^ces shall not be
slowfull to keep and defend you and by whom ye shall be d^fended / and all
evil and harms / by the mean of his good deeds shall be destroyed / and him
that most hardyly shall put him forth for to destroy your ennemies / For such
ought to be chosen king and none other / and when his people had herd the
reasons abouesayd and known his great discrecion wit and understanding they
were greatly ameruaylled and / answered to him thus We have herd and understand
thy great reasons / And have resseyned and resseyue thy good counceyll / and
therefore we wole and byseche the that thou Reygne and have the lordship upon us
during thy life / we hope that there is none that has so well deseruid tobe our
king And thus they chees him to there king and to their lord and coroned him and
yaf him their blessings / and praid to god that he would bless and mayntene
him To whom he said I have herd the prayer that ye have made for me /
beseching to god that he wol stedefaste the love of me in your hertes and
corages And that by no manner of the delectacion he suffer me to do thing again
your proffites ne to my disworship. and sone after he sent lettres to all the
princes and good towns of his Royaume And when he had sent his lettres One
daire king of perce and of mede sent to Alexandre for tribute like as he had
of his fader And he sent him word that the hen that leyd that egg is deed
And after this Alexander made great conquestis^ and when he had conquered Jude
he went to acontre callid bragman / the which when they wiste his coming /
they sent many wise men to him / which salewed him and said / sir alexander
thou have no cause to werre upon us / ne to be evil willi^g / for we ben both
pour and meke / and we have nothing but only sapie^ce / the which if thou
wolt have / pray to god that he wol give her to the for by battle thou shall
not have her And when alexander herd hem say so / he made al his Ooste to
tarry and with few of his knights went within the said contre for ten quere
further of the truth And when he entered with in the same ground / he fond
many pour folks women and chylderen al naked gadring herbs in the feldes And
he axid of them many questio^s^ to which they ansuerd right wisely / and than
he bad hem axe of him sum thing that might do hem good and to all their
people / and he would yeuen it hem gladdy And then they said / Sir we axe the
none other thing but ye thou will give us everlasting life Then Alexander
ansuerd and said / hou might ama^ make other me^nes lives everlasting / wha^ he
may not length his owen life an our And that ye axe of me is in no man's
power that lives Than they said to hym^ Sith thou have good knowleche thereof.
wherefore trauayllest thou thy self to destroy all the world / and to gadre
all the worldly tresours and wost not when thou must leave hem Then Alexander
said to hem. I do not all these things that ye say of my self but god has
sent me through all the world for texalte and magnifye his law and to
destroy them that bileue not in him. And sometime Alexander went dysguysed
visyting his lords and enqueryng of her deeds And upon atyme he came in to a
town of his own. And saw two men of the same town before a Judge pleting. of
the which one said to the Judge / Sir Judge I have bought an house of this man /
And long after I have found within the same a tresour within therthe / which
is not mine / And I have offered to diliuere it to him And he has refused it /
wherefore Sir I biseche the that he be compelled to take it for as much as he
knows it is not mine for I have no right thereto Then the Judge coma^ded his
adverse party tanfuere to the same^ and then he said / Sir Judge that same
tresour was never mine but he has edyfyed in that place that was byf^re common
to all tho that would have edyfyed therein / And therefore I have no right to
take it / And then they both required the Judge that he would take it to him
self / to whom he answe / red and said / sithen it is so that ye say / that
ye have no right to whom the heretage has longed and yet longs where the
tresour was found / hou should I have any right thereto that am but a stranger
in that caas / and never a fore herd speak thereof. ye would excuse you thereof
and give me the charge of the tresour / that is evil do Then he axid of him
that had found the tresour whether he had any childeren / which ansuerd he
had a sone / and he axide that other in like wise / and he said he had a
daughter / Then the Judge said and Iuged that a marriage should be made bitwene
them and that they should have the tresour by that mean And when Alexandre
herd this Judgment / he had great meruayll thereof / and said thus to the Iuge^
I trow that there is not in all the world so rightwis ne so true a Judge as thou
art / And the Judge that knew him not said and axid of him whether any Judge
would have don other wise Ye certainly said Alexander in many lands / Then
the Judge having great meruayll thereof axed of him whether it rayned and the
son did shine in tho lands / as though he would have said that is was
meruayll that god should send any light or rain or other good things to them
that do not right and true Justice / And thereof Alexander had gretter
meruaylle than before and said that there were but few such people upon earth /
as they were in that land And as Alexander went out of that land he passed
through a cite / in which all the houses of that cite were of one heighte / and
before the door of every house was a great pytte or grave in which cite there
was no Judge / whereof he had great meruaylle^ And axed of the inhabytauntis
therein wherefore such thingis should serue^ The which ansuerd hiin and said
First for the outrageous height of houses. love and Justice can not be long in
a town among the peple^ And they said that the pittes or graves were their
own houses to which they should sone go to and there dwell until the day of
Iugem^nt. And as touching that they had no Judge. they said that they made good
Justice of them self wherefore they neded no Judge. Then Alexander departed
from them right well plesed And before his death he wrote a lettre unto his mother
desiring her to make no sorrow for him And sone after Alexa^dre died and was
put in a Coffre of gold and buried in Alisau^dre^ and he was born theder with
great reverence by kings princes and other great lords / that kept and
fulfilled his testament as he had ordeigned Then stert up one of the grettest
lords of them that kept him and said thus / They that never wept for other
kings / now ought to weep for this same And tho yt never had meruaill of
adusite / should now have meruaill of the death of this king And he desired the
other lords that they should say so^me good thing for to conforte the people
that was greatly dismayed and troubled for the death of king alexa^dre / or for
the death of the worthyest king that ever was Then one of them said king
alexa^dre was wo^t to keep gold and seluer / and now gold and seluer keep him /
And he said it by cause of the chest that his body lay in which was of gold
And another said alexander is deperted fro si^nes and filthes and now his saul
is with the good saules which ben purified And another said alexander was wont
to chastise all men / and now he is chastysed And another said / the kings
were wont to dread him and now the pourest man of all the world dredeth him
not And another said / yesterday all the earth suffised not to Alexander / and
now the length of his body suffiseth him And anothe r said Alexander might
here yesterday and no body durst speak aeynst his will / and now every man may
speak and he heerith not And another said the mere yt thestate of king
Alexander was great and more exellent the more is thoccasion of his death
grievous and pytefull And another said thoo that saw not yesterday Alexander
ferede him gretely / and now thoo that see him fereth him not Another said
Alexander was he whose enemies durst not come nere him / and now his friends
dispreyse and will not see him And when Alexander began to regne he was
but.xviij^ years of age / And he reigned ^xvij. year of the which he
employed.ix. years in bataylle and in conqueryng And ^viij. year he restyd him
visiting the grounds and lands that he had conqueryd And he had victory
upon.xxiiij. manner of langages / And in two years he sought all thorient and
o^cident / And the nombre of his knights that were commonly of his retenew and
at his wages were CCC.xiij^M. without yoma^rye and other men necessary to his
wars And he deyde in the eage of.xxxv^ yeres^ and he was of sangweyn color /
his face full of pockis / One of his eyes graye and that other black / small and
sharp teth visaged like a lion. And was of great strength and loved much
wars fro his chyldehode unto his lives end And he commanded that the people
should worship god and keep hem from sin And said the world is not sustained
but commonly by science / And the royames be not directed but by the same / and
all things ben governed by reason And said s^pie^ce is messagier of reason
And it byfell that Alexander passid through a town wherein / vij / kings had
reigned before / And he askid if any of their kinrede was alive / And they of
the town said ye / a sone of one of the said kings / And alexander desired to
see him / And the people said to alexander that he was ever in the chircheyerd
And alexander went to see him. and axid of him wherefore he abood so in the
chircheyerd / and why he would not take upon him such astate as his fader had
and his Auncestris / as other men do / Seeing that it was the will of all the
p^ple And the young child ansuerd and said / O right b^unteuous king I have
here a thing to do / the which when I have don it / I shall do thy commandment
/ To whom then alexander axid what thing it was that he had to do there And
he ansuerd I am sechyng the bones of my fader and of mine auncestris kings for
to put hem a part from the other but I find hem all so semblable that I can
not know one from the other Then alexander said to him / thou ought
tacquere worship in this world / And If thou had good and strong courage /
thou might have all thy faders goods and of thy predecessors and all there
honors To whom the young child ansuerd and said. I have good herte^ And
alexander axed him wherein And he said by cause that I have found lyff without
death / yougthe without eage / richesse without poute / Joy without troble /
and health without sekenes Certainly said alexander of all these thi^ge^ have I
none / Then said the child / if ye will have hem / axe hem of him that has
hem / and he may give hem and none other Then Alexander said that he had
never seen man of so great discrecion Alexander used every day to be in a
certain place / for to here the conplayntes of every body / And it was so that
upon a day only that there came none to complain unto him / And therefore he
would not that day should be put in the nombre of the days of his regne And
when he was ready to fight with king daire / it was told him that the same
daire had with him more than. occ ^M. good fyghting men^ whereto he ansuerd and
said a good cook ought never to be abashed to see in his kechyn many sheep
among other beestis And the patryarkes and prelates that were for that time came
and said to him. God has give to the lordship upon many royames / regions and
contrees to thentente that thou sholdest have many children begoten of thy body
/ for to have the succession of the same after thy death / and therefore it were
good that thou sholdest have many wives / To whom he ansuerd. that it should
torn to him to great ashame yt had overcome all the mightyest men of the
world / for to be dysconfited by women There came to him a pour man well and
wisely spekyng which was pourly arrayed / To whom Alexander said I have
maruaylle that thy clothyng is not after thy speech / For there is between them
great difference^ Then the pour man said. O mighty king I may of my self
learn to speak and to have reason with me / and ye may resonably clothe me /
then Alexander made him to be clothed with one of his best gowns Also there
passed a thief before alexa^dre that was going to be hanged / which said / O
worthy king save my life for I repent me sore of my misdeeds / Then Alexander
commanded that he should be hanged while he had good repentance Also upon a
time one axid of him x. pieces of gold / To whom Alexander said / thou art
not worthy to have so much / And he said to him again / Sir if I am not worthy
to have so much yet ar ye able to give it me And alexander axid of Aristotle
what thing a good and a manly king ought continuelly to do / And he ansuerd
that he ought to think every night to the good governance of his people / and
the day following to put it in effect And it was axid of him what thing was
most delectable in conquering of lands and of countrees. And he said the
most delectacion was to give largely and recompense them that have done good
seruise to him And he axid of Aristotle by what mean he should be counceylled
And he ansuerd and said / Ordeine upon the government of thy household him
that has many servants and can well rule and govern them / and make him thy
procurour and receyuour of thy money that has great lyuelode and spends
discretely and notably And a Patriarch axid of him what he would do with so
many men as he had / And he ansuerd I that am lord of them that been great and
mighty lords may well forbere to be lord of their seruau^tis And there came two
men before him different of oppinions / to whom he said / the sentence that
shall plese that one shall displese that other / and therefore co^sente ye to the
troth / and that shall plese you both And it was axid of him why he worshippid
more his master than his fader / And he ansuerd for as much as I have of my
master euerlastnig life / And I have of my fader life but for a certain time And
when dares daughters were taken it was told him that they were right fair.
and therefore he would not see them feeryng to have don any dishonest things.
sayng that great dishonor were unto him that had oucome so many notable and
manly men in the bataylles / if he should be oucomen by women being in his
prysons And it bifelle that one made a long sermon before him which noyed
much to alexander wherefore he said the predicacion is not to be lawded that
endures over the power of the herbeners. but that is good that endures after
the possibilite of them that hereth it^ And it was axid of him how men might
acquyre the love of other men / and he ansuerd in doing hem good. or else at
lest in doing hem none harm And said men so^me time throue better by their
enemies than by their friends And it was axid of him how he might be so myghty^
considering that he was so young of age. And he said for as much as I have
trauaylled ^^^cquere frendys / and yeuyn to mine enemyes^ and by this manner I
have power upon hem all And said it is a great loss to a man to lose his
frendis and more than to lose his sone or his tresour And said the friends that
be acquerid bygood dedes^ ben better than tho that been acquerid by force And
upon a time as alexander went to sport him privily. certain men being at a
wyndow keste wa^ter upon him. wenyng that he had been one of their felaws and
when they saw yt it was alexander they were greatly aferd / and alexander badde
hem be not aferd sayng yt they had weted none but him yt they thought to wete
And as aristotle taught many kings sons with Alexander / he axed ones of one
of hem / what shall thou give me when thou shall be a king The which said I
shall make the my great governor / and in like wise he axid of another / which
said I shall give to the half my royame^ And th^nne he axid of alexander /
which ansuerd him thus / Maistre enquere of me not this day upon that / that I
have to do to morrow / for when I shall see that I never saw / I shall think
that I never thought / but if I regne as thou say I shall / then I shall do
as thou shall see and think to be couenable / And then Aristotle said to
him / Certainly I wot well that thou shall be a great and a mighti king. for
thy face and thy nature shows it so Alexandre said to one that long had been
his lieutenau^t and had never rebuked him of no vice / I am no thing pleasid
with thy service / Why sire said his lieutenau^t / By cause said Alexander
that I am a man as another and err and have erred many a time / since thou came
in my service / and thou saw never no fawte in me / therefore thou art not
such / as I ought to have to be my lieutenau^t / for thou art not wise / and
if thou have seen and known my fawtes and not corrected me thereof Thou art not
true to me And he said / Reason lets not to acquere science / but sloth
dispraysith it And sum axed of a wyseman called Nychomake / what was the
cause that men obeyed so lightly to Alexa^dre / And he said by cause that he
was virtuous / that he had well kept Justice and he had been of good co^uersacion
and of right excellent government And there were two men which axed every of
them to have to his wife the daughter of a rich man / of which two. one was
rich and the other pouere And the fader yaf the daughter to the pour man /
wherefore Alexander axid of him why he did so. And he said by cause the rich
is ignorant and like to become a pour man. and the pour is wise and able to
become a rich man Alexander axid of a wise philosophre by what mean the
royames were well directid and holden in good astate. And he ansuerde by
obeyssau^ce of the people and the justice of the king And as Alexander fought
ones in bataill many women came in the same bataill against him / then he
withdrewe him hastily and said to his men if he should have victory of this
bataill where thise women ben / it were no worship to us / and if they had the
victory / then it were to us a perpetuel shame / wherefore we shall not fight
against them while the women ben there / And said it is a perilous thing a
man tabide so long in the sea that the storm and tempest come upon him / that
may well deperte during the fair weder / In like wise it is of them that dwell
in princes and kings houses And said it is a foul thing to aman to have
great words without effect. and it is a fair thing to him that put his
werkis before his words / And said the grettest and most laudable liberte
that is to aman^ is to keep him from couetise And when his fader commanded him
that he should gladly here the conmaundeme^tis of his maistre / he said / he
would not only here them / but he would fulfille them with glad heart to his
power And said It is worse ama^ to have defaute of discrecion / then of
richesses

THolome was a right wyseman and well understood / and in especial in / iiij
/ scie^cis that is to wit / Geometry music / arismetrik and astrology /
and he made many good bokis among the which one is callid Almageste the which
is of Astrology / and he was borne in Alexandrie the gretest cite that is in
the land of Egipte. and there he made his consideracions in the time of king
Adryan. and made his dictions upon the consideracions at Roodes / he was not
king all be it that many persons calls him king / And he lived.lxxviij.
years And / said he is wise that disposith his tongue to speak of god / and he
that knows him not is the most fool of all And said / he that is enclyned
to his will is nighe to the Ire of god / and the nerer that a man approucheth
the death / the more he ought to labor and traueyll to dowele And said
Sapience abides no longer in the heart of afoole. than afleyng thing that may
not tarry in no place And said good wit and good discrecion ben felawes And
said / A man of good sapience can not dye / ne a man of good understanding can
neuir be pouer And said Sapience is atre that wexeth grene in the heart and
fructifieth in the tongue And said Beware that thou dispute not with him that
has no knowledge / ne give not thy conseyl but to him that askith it / ne tell
not thy secret but to him that can keep it And said he that wol live well ought
not to keep in his heart all his aduersitee^ And said the maystre of agrete
house has many mela^colyes And said speak wisely aswele for thyself as for all
other And said if thou may not eschew sometime to be wroth at lest let
not thy wrath last long And said the hertis of good people ben the caste^l and
forteres^is of secrets And said a man that is not to be correctid by other me^
may surly correct them of their faults And said he that askid co^nseil of the
wyseman and does there aftir whether it turns him to good or to evil he ought
not to be blamed thereof And sayde^ It is bettir / a king to direct his people /
than to have great habondaunce of knyghtis And said Surete puts a weye
sorrow / and fere empescheth gladness And said The wordis of god avails not
to them that have put al their heart to the world And said It is to great
folly aman to think to much on the things that passith his understanding And
said men been of ^ij. natures some wolle never be content how be it that they
find enough / and somother seek and find nothing And said men cause tacquere
and get money. And money is the cause tacquere men And sayde^ He of the which
the Science excedith his wit may be likened to a feeble shepherd that has a
great heep of sheep in his keeping And said he that has put al his entente to
his flessly delites / is more bo^de than a keytif And said the higher that a
man is exaltid in his lordship / the more grievous it shall be to him to fall from
the same And said thought is the key of certaynete And said the reffuses of a
nygard ben bettir than the largesces of a prodygall waster And said. thou
can do nothing so acceptable to god as to do well to him that has offensed
against the And said if thou wol be wise be not in feliship with foolis. but be
ever in feliship with them that been wyser than thy self And said the saul can
not be deceived into the time that the body takes his end And said. Folly is
the grettest ennemy that any body may have And said. Good will is the fondement
of all good works / and good werkis is the messagier in the other world And
said he that kepith the good opinion and leueth the evil yeueth great rest to
his heart And said Sickness is the prison of the body and salvation of the
saul

ASsaron said that a knig in his kingdom may be do^maged and hurt / and
specially by five things / the first is by to great drienesse as to be iij.
year without Rayn. the second is by expending more than his lyuelode comes to
/ the therde is / to use to much wo^men wyn and huntyng / the fourth is to be
of evil maneres and of wicked conditions and also to be to cruel and vengeable
/ the fyfte is / to have many enemies And said the most notable maneris and
conditions and the most prouffytable is to be liberal and true of his word
And said he that is liberal may not live amys / the true speker may not be
shamed of his speking / the meke and lowly man can not be hated / the sobre man
can not be seek / and he that well and dyligently vnderstondith to his
bysenesse may never repent th^rof and brings him to good perfection And said
a king or a prince ought not to trust them that disprayse him in him that is
covetous / in him that is com from great poverty to great richesses / in him
from the which he has taken the goods and lordshippes / in him that has
suffered many domages and hurtes for the royal mageste and ordinance Ne in him
that has made any aliaunce or promise with his enemies / and he ought to be
well ware that he give no power to noon such as thoo abouesaide And said It
is an impossible thing that the man may keep him from falling in some fawte that
is exaltid with a king in great magnificence without desserte And said when a
wise prince knows that any of his men had offenseth against him. he ought
hastily to enquere the troth of the deed. and the quantite of the trespass. and
if it be done wilfully or by Ignorance / and also If he was wount to do so. and
if he be like to fall therein again. And upon every of the same pointis to
Remedy hastily And said. The kings seruauntis ought to show in s^ruyng him
their good virtues their feith the noblesse of their kynrede. to thentente that
the king may bettir know hem and do to every of them as he shall have deserved
And said / If A king loves and cherissheth the untrue and wikkid men as them
that been good and true. he ought not to be called king for he is not like to
reygne long And said. If the kyngis conseyllours his physicien and his
confessor deleth with other things. than langith to their offices The king
shall contynuelly be endommaged. seek of body^ and of the soul / And like to
come to a foul end

And said. He that says not troth to his lec^e And he that counceylleth with
his friend And tells him not the truth of his counceylle. he dystroyeth him
self And Assaron sayd^ A king should not committee to another the besynes. that
is necessary to him self for to do And Assaron sayd^ The most secret
counseylle of the king Is his conscience and his good deeds is his best tresour
/ And of all men. the trewest is the best. And the best Rychesses ben they
that be truly and duly gotten And he says / a king should commit his
besynesses to him that he has proved in faith / in wit and in good
governance / and if he may find no such / take him that has ever be
co^uersant with wise men

And he says a wise king ^f good understanding amendeth and auaylleth much
his counseillours And he says when a king of good discrecion has to do two
right hasty things / he should begin at the noblest ande at the most
prouffyttable / And If they ben both two of one estate / begi^ne at that which
may best be recouerd in time coming And he says if a king be mercyful / his
besynes shall goo well. his wysedom shall avail him in time coming / if he be
true his people shall reio^se with him / and if he be Just. his regne shall
endure And he says kings should get good reno^mee and other mean dignitees
by good mesure / for outrageousnes is not enduryng And he says yt belongs to
a conquerous king to set and keep good Justice in his Royames and other
lordshippes gotten / And hou be it that it is a greuos thing to conquer them /
yet is it a more greuours and more chargea^le thing to keep them well And he
says he that is most complete of wytt / is he that knows him self. And that
departed him not from thobeyssaunce of god for what manner occasion that comes
to him / and that contynuelly thanketh him for the goods that he has sent him
And assaron says that an evil law and the love of a shrewe lasts no longer
than the shadow of acloud And assaron says that a wyseman enforces him to
fle and wythdraweth from harm And the fool does great pain to find hit And
assaron says when a wyseman that is counceylour or offycer to a king sees
that the king well do or say any thing domageable and harmefull to him or
to his Royaume or to his people and subgettis he should address and remember him
of good examples of chronicles and histories of his noble and wise predecessor
concerning unto that purpoos in so much / that the king conceive and have
knowleche that he says it for his well and worship etc^

LEgmon was born in Ethyope and learned his science in the land of Asteyn in
the time of king dauyd the prophet / And was bought by a Jew for an esclaue
or bondsman for / xxx / marck. And his maistre pleyed gladly at dise^ and there
ran by fore his maistres gate a River And on a time as his maistr and an other
man playde at dyse. they leyde and set an owche to plege / that who of them
lost a game^ should do the will of the winnar^ or he should drink all the water
that ran and passed before his yate. So it happend that his maistre lost And
that other commanded him. that he should do hoolly his comaundement^ And the
loser ansuerd that he was ready to be at his Iugement^ Then he said to him.
thou shall give me all the good that thou have of any valewe. or thou shall
drink all the watre of this Ryuier / And he that had lost demanded only
respyte of one day for tauise him. and that other granted it to him / And
thus he abode in his house right pensyf and full of thought how he might escape
fro this perille. And as he was in this thought legmon his bondma^ and servant
came home and brouht upon his neck a burden of wood and salewed his maistre.
The which gaf him no answer. for the thought he was in^ How be it he was
accustomed for taraysone him for the good words that he fond in him. and
then legmon said to him Maistre who has angrid or greuid the / And he
answered nothing again And legmon said / maistre tell me the cause of this
sorrow and woo / For I shall lygthly remedy it if I may^ and then his maistre
reherced to him all the fayte as is before reh^rced / And then legmon said to
him that he should in no wise abasshe him / For he would give him good counceyll
Thou shall demand him said he^ if thou shall drink that the riuyer co^teyneth
now this present time or ellis all that. that shall run and come continuelly
/ and I wot well he shall say that thou shall drink all that it conteyneth now
/ and when he has so said thou shall say to him / that he stop and make the
riuyer to stand without rennyng any more / and that thou art ready to drink
hit that it holds now / and thus thou shall win thy cause When the master
herd the counseyll of his bondsman he was much recomf^rted^ And in like wise
on the morn^ he said to him that had won the owche / and in this wise he
escaped from the paryll / and fro then forthon he asranchised legmon and made
him fre that before was bond and thrall / And he did and gaf him much good
and was reputed for right a wyseman And one of his felaws of time past met
him on a time / And demanded of him art thou not he that were wont to keep
sheep with me / And he ansuerd yes / how said that other who has set the in
this estate / I shall tell the said legmon sayng of truth / to be true / and
not tentende upon vnprouffitable things And it was said that a voys apperyd to
him / which said to him / wolt thou be a great lord upon therthe and he
ansuerd if god will / I will obey him but if he will give me the choice and my
playsir / I will peace One asked him wherefore he would not be a king / he
ansuerd / if I judge rightfully / I may not escheue the hate of many men / And
if I dissimile / I shall withdraw me fro the way of paradyse / I had lever have
in this world suffisaunce with pouerte and win the bliss of that other world
than for to lose to be high raised in this world And david was in a place
where much people spack among whom legmon was stylle / and he demanded him
wherefore spekest not thou / as other do. he ansuerd by cause there is no word
good but of god ner no good silence but to think on god And this Jew that was
maystre of legmon gaf him much good / the which he distributed in alms /
and lent it to pour nedy people without usure / And therefore god multeplied
al his goods greatly And it is said he left all his richesses and made him
self a recluse in a temple solitairely unto his death / and there prechid many
fair thi^gis and wysedoms to his sone And said / Sone take abstinence and
restrain thy will / For if thou preyse the world and the diverse adventures
that daily comen in doing offensis in thing deffended of god / thou desire
but death therefore enforce the teschewe the evil and to follow the good / for
the good mortifieth and destroys the evil And said sone speak ever of god
and god shall ever put good words in thy month Sone set always thyn owen
werkys tofore thyn eyes / And other me^nys behind the a part Sone when thou
see any synnar / repreue him not of his fawtes / but think on thyn own
which of thou shall ye^^^ acompt Sone employe not thy courage in the love of
this world^ which is a thing that passes and deceyueth all them that affie
in hit / And hold the content with litil / and coueyte not the goods of other
Sone set attemperau^ce in thy living. and be replenisshid with Sapience and
converse with wysemen and so may thou get wysdom

Sone be simple. well doying. thinkyng moche^ and of few words. but if they
be true. and be no great lawgher. And be not dispreyser ne mocquer of other /
be stylle and not full of langage / for I have ofter repented me of much

that thou be defrawded for to believe. that thou have in the thing. which thou
have not. though that men bear the it on hand by flaterie Sone who loves god

doctors and techers with their techinges ben lykened unto sprynging wells
rennyng^ of which the people ben continuelly seruid. and yet they abide always
full And know thou sone that if a fool speak he shall be mo^qued for his
vncurtais speech / If he be still and speak not / he shall think evil / if he
do any thing / it is evil and loses his time / if he set him to study / he
shall lose his dispense and shall not prouffyte / if of aue^ture he be rich he
shall be proud and presumptuous / if he be pour / he shall fall in despayr. If
he have any good garmente / he will be proud thereof / If he demand any thing /
he shall aye it vncurtaisly / and if any man axe of him to borowe / he shall
deny it. If he give ought he shall reproach him. if a man give to him he shall
conne him no thank. when he is merry or Joyous / it is out of mesure. And when
he is angry he is in likewise / if men tell him any thing in secret / he shall

shall deffame and mocque him he shall comande them to do well^ And he will do the
werst he can / And he shall comande them to say trouth^ and he shall lie / his

call the waster. if thou give to him noght he shall hold the for a kaityf and
nigard if thou be debonayr / he shall say thou art a best and who so draws

on his departing. he does well and comandeth other to do the same / he
defends evil and keeps him self fro doing it. And that lies in his heart /
the tongue pronou^ceth^ and his deeds ben according to his words Sone
understand wysdom and excersise the same without thi^king on other things
for when thou have gotten it / thou shall be ever in Joy / And know that it is
not gotten but by debonairte^ and by good keeping of thy tunge For the tunge is
the door of the almerye of sapience / wherein every man may well enter / if it be

understands and nothing prouffyteth to him / sone acco^panye the with them
that god loves Sone yield thankingis to our lord god of the goods that he
has made the to resseyue in humilite / and depart them to thoos that be nedy
Sone if thou have don any good yt the seems good / give no laud ne preising
to thy self thereof / for thou wotest not if god be pleasid with all or not / In
every work is commonly something ever contrary / and thaduersarye of the work
is proud thought / sone coueyte not the delites of this world but only them
yt may make the nyghe to god / Sone trust thou verily in god and love them yt

acceptable to god tha^ good understanding and that is in ten conditions that
is to weten in not preysing him self / in well doing / in being content of
things necessary to the lyff / to give of his goods for goddis sake / to

some ben badde / Wherefore a man should humble and meke him to both / to the
good in praying god to make him semblable and like to hem / to the evil for
as much as it is not known. whether his goodnos be within him hyd^ And he will

Sone enhabyte thy self with the wysemen continuelly / for god enlumind their
hertes by words of sapience in such wise as the goods under earth ben
moysted by rain and with dewes And sum men say that legmon is buried in a
town called karaualle bitwene the mesquitte and the march. And there ben
buried.lxx. prophets that deyde after legmon the which the children of ysrael
kept so long in hostage that they deyde for hunger And when Legmon was nygh his
death he wept sore. and his sone axid him why he wept for fere of death or for
sorrow that he had to leave the world He ansuerd I weep for none of tho two
things but I weep because I have away for to goo. from which I saw never man
come again / and I bear but litill vytaill with me. and am charged with many
great charges^ And I wot never whether I shall be aleged and discharged ar none
when I shall come to the end of my way And he said to his sone / Sone thou
ought to dread god / and not only to be worshippid of men Sone when thou
come in aplace where shall be spoken of god / abide there / for if thou be a
fool / thou may be amended. and become wise / if thou be wise thou shall
encrece thy wysdom / and if god send them any good thou shall have thy part /
but and if thou haunte places where god is not spoken of / all the contrary
shall happen to the / sone be aferd of the vengeance of our lord as much as
thou may / and dread him and consider his right great puissance and might And
said in like wise as in giving largely a man makes of his enemy his friend /
right so by pride a man makes of his friend his enemy And said the wor^de
shewith the wysedom of the man and therefore ought aman to be well auised what he
says And said atrewe man rests in his truth / and the reward of a liar is
/ that he be not bileuid of that he reherseth And said reherce ne tell nothing
to him that will not bileue the / ne demand not that thing that thou wost well
shall not by granted to the ne promise no thing but thou may and wilt hold
and keep And said thou ought a boue all thnig fle the company of a liar /
and if thou may not eschew his company / at lest beware that thou bileue
nothing that he says And said sone set the not in the hiest place for it is
better that thou be taken up fro the lowest place for to sit in the highest /
than to be taken from the highest and be set al benethe And said Sone yet ones
I comande the that thou dread god above all things. for that is thing
rightful and prouffytable to the. And do so that all thy thoughts be always
in him and thy words semblably^ for the spekyng and thinking in god
surmou^teth all other words and thoughts as he him self surmou^teth all
other creatures And therefore men ought tobeye him. notwithstondyng any other
thing that they ben constreyned to Sone make thy ^risons and prayers duly to
him^ for prayer is as a ship that is in the s^e. for if she be good she shall be
sauf and all that been therein. And if she be euyll^ she shall perisshe and all
they that be therein And said A man may lightly find his living and his
necessitees in this world / which is of litil during as to us creatures. but a
man should pourueye him of things necessaries. for to bear with him when he
shall depart hens And said How may a man make another to change his will^ that
can not refreine his own will And said Good will is one of the goods wh^rof
god is seruid. And gladly to here things lowable. is to him agreeable. And a
curtoyse ansuer ought moch^ to be preysed If the behooves to send any message
or l^gacion. send a wyseman^ and if thou may none find goo thy self And
said believe not him that lies to the of another man^ for he shall lie in like
wise to another man of the And said it is more light to change montaignes fro
one place to another / than for to make him understand that has none
entendement And said do not that of which thou sholdest have shame to see
another do it

Two pacientis ben in this world / of which one is he that sees and endures
patiently that he hateth^ and that other is to refrain his will There ben three
estates of men that ben known but in three maners^ that is to wit the pacient
is not known but in his aduersite and in his Ire The valyant man is not known
but in war And the friend is not known but in necessite Of all other manners
and conditions the worst is a man to be suspecionous of his friend. and to
discover things secret / to have trust and affiau^ce in every man^ to speak
oumoche of things vnproffitable^ and to be in danger of evil people for
couetise of goods te^porell And said the thought is the myrrour of the man
wherein he may behold his beauty and his filthe And he sai^e beware and keep
the for to be suspeco^us / for suspecion takes a way the love fro the people
Wit without doctrine is a tree without fruit And said for to be joyous and to
salewe eueri man gladli / to be liberal in gyuyng and receyuyng and to forgive
gladly his evil will maken aman to belouid of each body

ANese the phylosophre says. When men wexe old Their virtues ben despised And
the rich men ben more ferful than pour men And he said the noble death is
better than a vile domynacion And said the most and grettest ewre or hap of
aman is to have a good felawe^ now then accompanye the with good people and
thou shall be one of them One of the grettest vylonyes and inyquitees of the
world is for to do vilonie unto an impotent person And said If thou have don
any trespass or sin repent the anon without abiding unto the ^oren And he
said thou ought to give him thank / that does the good of what condition
that he be of / so that he do it liberally and in good entente And said he may
not know ne apparceyue many thingis / that can not apperceyue ne know him
self / And said if thou will have enduring love with another put thy self in
pain te^forme him in good maneris and said if a king be just and rightful he
shall seygnorye and be lord ou the corages of his people if he be otherwise
though he be named for king yet will they have their corages unto another

SAcdarge says that the works of this world ben adressed by two thingis one
is by science of which the soul is adressyd. and that other is bysenes of
which the soul and the body ben adressid And said men leave for to do much
harm and evil when they doubt and fere our lord / And said noblesse of
lignage is much couenable to receive science Thentencion of the man should be
for to refrain his courage from fylth and foul things / for the good life
makes the good reno^mee and causes a good end / he is right exellent which
is honorable in all his disportes / and of whom the wit surmonteth the Ire
He said late it suffice to the to be so wise / that thou can do well and
keep the fro doing evil

There is nothing so evil unto a man / as to be evil endoctrined / and in
especyal / when he is issued of noble and good lignage And said for to conne
science / it is a much honourrable and profitable thing / For by hit goods
of this world and of that other ben gotten / A wise man will nothing have of his
prince but that which he has gotten by sayng truth and by his good works
And said he is a good lord that takes upon him pain to kep^ his sugettis in
such wise / as he keeps his owen body. and that he be not so rigorous and
oppressing. that them behooves to leave his lordship And that also he be not to
them so debonayr. that they dispyse his mau^dementis And he said the most
curteys gyuer is he. that gives without axing And said In what someuer place
thou be with thyn ennemy. be it in disporte or otherwise. make al way good
wacche on thy self though so be thou be strenger than he and mightier yet
labor al way to make peace And said in like wise as it is great pain to the
body of aman to sustain thing that is inpossible to him^ right so is it a
grievous thing to a wyseman for to teache a fool And said. A suspecious man may
never have good life And said he is right Ignorant and unkind that can not
g^ue thankyng for the goodness that is don to him. but yet he is more unkind
that denies it to other And said. He that demau^deth but reason is able to
vaynquysshe and overcome his enemy

THesille said. Thou ought to love bettir the Rude words that been
prouffytable and true. than the sweet wordis thet been of deceyte and
flateringe Some men put venym in sweet drinkis and the medicines that sonest
heleth people^ aren bittre / and of evil savor

And said It is a foul thing to be so curious for the feding of the body.
that it hurts both it and the saule^ And said / as ashipman takes not the sea without he seth that he has a couenable wind. no more should a man dispose
him to any manner werkis without that it were conue^^^ble for the saul And said
thou ought to do that^ that is most proufytable for the body. and rather
that / that is most couenable for thy saul. and not to do the contrary And
said he that can well conseille other / ought to conseille well him self and
have remembrance to the salvation of his saul / for it is a great vice / to
aman to worship and help another and disworship and hurt him self And said as
it bycometh evil aman / that has afoule and unclean body to be clothed with
cloth of gold or with cloth of sylke. right so it is afoule thing to have
great beawte of body and of vysage and be full of evil werkys And said we
ought by reason to keep cleenly our bodyes^ we are mor specially bound to keep
honestly and well that. that yeueth us knowledge of our lord god. that is the
wysedom of the saul and not to hurt or ouercom it with meets or drynkes. And
it was axid of him how aman might keep him from Ire And he ansuerd / in
remembryng that it is inpossible he should alweye be obeyed / but that he must
sometime obey And that he shall not always command but he shall be conmaunded^
And also that god sees all thing. and if he has this in consideracion^ he
should not long be wroth / and he saw agrete fat man to whom he said thou
pains the sore to break the wallis of thy prison And said when thou shall
correct another show hit not^ like him that would venge him of his ennemy but
do as the phisician that courtoisely speaks to his pacient^ And when thou
shall correct thiself show the as the hurt man does to his leche

SAint Gregory seide Recomaunde to god the beginning and the end of al thy
werkis And said study / and trauaylle to know all things. and reteyne and
hold with the thoes that been most proffytable And said. pouerte is evil. but
evil richesse much worse And said. be thou pacient and have reason in thy
wrath. and light thy self with Sapience instead of ca^dell^ and presume not to
be better than thou art^ but think thou art dedely. Repute the for a stranger
and thou shall worship the strangers And said when they ship shall be laden
with great transquillite than thou ought fe / re to be drowned And said men
ought to receive merrily all that god sends hem And said the hattered of
good men is better than the love of evil people And said frequente and haunte
the companyes of wysemen and not of the rich And said dispraise not a litel
of goo^e thinges^ for they may greetely encresse and amend And said Endure
patiently without taking vengeance

GAlyen was one of the.viij. leches Right excellent in medycine^ which were
all.viij. superlatyff above all other lechis. of the which the first was
Esculapyus / The second Gorius. The therde Myrius / The fourth Promenides.
The.v. platon. The.vj. Esculapius the second The.vij. Ypocras The.viij. Galien

lord.ij.C. years And he composed and made well a iiij^C^ volumes of bookis
among which the rben ^viij. that been studied in such things as men desire to
learn of the art of medicine^ his fader was right diligent to put him to the
scole and spendid much good upon him / and sent him in to the country of Asie
in the cite of Pargame. Athenes Rome and Alexandrie / for to find the best
maistres / And there he learned physik g^ometrie / gramayre / and other sciences
And he learned physik of a woman called cleopatre which taught him many good
herbis / And prouffytable to all manner of sekenesses^ And he dwelled long in
Egipte: for to know all these herbis / And long after he deyed nygh the Cite
of Escam / fast by the grene see. in the marches of Egypt. And in his youth
he desired greetly to know the science demonstratiue^ And he was so enclyned
to learn hit. that when he departed from the scole with other childeren his
mind was ever upon that^ that his master had taught him. whereof his fellows
mokkyd him / And axed him why he would not play / and sport him with hem. To
whom he said. I take as great pleasaunce to record my lesson. as ye do in your
pleyes. whereof his said felawes had great meruaylle And said that his fader
was happy to have such a child. and to put him to the scole^ that so well
loved wysdom / his fader was a great labourer^ his gramit fader was a souerayn
maystre carpenter^ and his gramitsirs fader was an harper and meter of lands
which is the science of geometry Galyen was at Rome in the reign of king
Octauien which reigned after Adrien and their he made a book of anascomie and
many other traityes^ Some sey that great part of his bookis were brent and among
hem some of aristotilles bookis written with his hand and of danagoras and of
Andromache. and a book that he had made of tryacles for venyms. and taught
the king of greece to break the hilles^ and fell the vallees and to make pleyne
weyes in there countres and edified Citees and closed hem with big wallis. and
also to make ryueres run through the towns / And in other places. where need
was. And to do all other things. that were to the commone proffyt. And in
thoos days they had more delectacion and plesau^ce to the good rule and
governance of their lordeship than to the ease and pleasaunce of their own
bodyes^ And their hertis were much set to have good vniuersitees and scoles
of great clerks. And specially in physyke^ And also they ordeigned in every
Cuntre and region certain folkis to gader herbs and to breng them to the
maistres of physyke for to preue them by experience. And the same herbs thus
approved were sent to the kings closid and sealled with their sealles. to
thentent that they should not be changed and than the kings ordeigned hem for
seek folkis And the said Galyen said wysdom can not proufyt to a fool Ne wit
to him that uses it not And said Heaviness comes of the things passed^ and
thought of things to come. And Galyen was four score year and vij. when he
said that many great lords be Ignoraunte When they be more enclyned to have
fair horses and rich gownes^ and other Iewles. than to win good fame by
good conditions And said The phisiciens were wont to have lordship and to
govern seek folkis and to cause them to do such things as weer most
expedient and prouffytable for their health. and no seek man durst disobeye his
phisicien / but should be conpelled to obey him wherefore they were the sooner
recovered and hole. And now the leches been subgettis to the seek folkys. And
be compelled to handylle hem easily. and softly^ And to give hem sweet drinckis
though it avails hem but litill / and therefore is there the more sekenesses /
and longer vnhelth And said / sometime thoo that were most sobre in their
metis and lest drank wine were best byloued and most praysid / and now the
most glottons / and th^o that oftenest ben dronkon ar the most set by / and the
rather set at great lords bourdes / which yeueth evil exempell to other
And said thou may well Instruct all men / sauf only thoos that be without
shame And said / aman that knows well him self / has power ynowe to correct
him self And said Aman may love him self so moche-that he is deceived thereby
for we se many that wene and seem to be good / and ar contrary And said / he
is just that may both do right or wrong and yet keep Justice / And he is
wise and dyscrete that knows that / that suffisith to be known / and that
does vertuousely to every creature And said like as a seek man desires / not
to depart from his phisicien / till he has recouerid his health which he
cowde not do by him self / In like wise aman ought to desire the company of a
confessor for the health of his saul / And he saw aman that was greatly made
of and cherisshed with kings for the strenght of his body of whom he said /
pera^^nture It shall cause him to repent hit at last

IT was asked of one called protege / wherefore it was that one of his
neighbors made dye his here in blak / he ansuerd. by cause no man should ask
to learn sapience of him / and plures said / the more good that a fool has
the more he is ^owle / And it was axid of one aristan / when it was good to
lie with a woman / he ansuerd / at altymes when aman will hurt enpayre and
feeble his body / And it was asked of dymicrates whereby he knew and perceived
best his wit / He ansuerd In that / that I think / I understand and know
but littyll And said the wyseman that replieth is bettir than the fool that
accords to every porpose / And there was awyse man called azee / that was a
prisonner to whom his master ax^d / of what kynr^de he was / He ansuerd
enquere not of my lynage / but axe of my prudence and conning / and was axed
of another called Sygonce. also prisonner of one that would have bought him /
whereto he was good / And he ansuerd to be delivered / and another man axid of
him If it were good that he should bye him / To whom he ansuerd I am no thing
worth but ye or some other bye me / and another said he dispraisith him self.
that dispraiseth all other / and yeueth him self lawde / And there was one that
prayed god to keep him from the danger of his frendis And it was asked him /
why he prayed not rather / that god should keep him from his enemies than fro
his fre^des And he ansuerd / for asmoche. as I may well keep me from mine
enemies in whom I have no trust / but I may not keep me from my friend whom
that I trust / It was axed of awyseman which be the most noble worldly
things / To whom he ansuerd / to love sapience / and to hate fooly / not to be
aschamed to learn / And it was axed of Archasam / which be the sciences that
children should learn He ansuerd thoos that cause them to hate ignorance in
there aage / And it was axed of another^ why he would have no silver / and he
ansuerd for asmoche as it come to men by fortune^ and is kept by nygardship
and couetise and is often so lish^ly spent and to evil use And another said
the love of a fool shall be more noysant to the than his hatered. And there was
aman that said to another. I shall put my peyn and dyligence to distroye the. He
ansuerd and said I shall enforce me to dystroye thy malyce^ and appease thyn Ire
And there came before a king.iij. wysemen^ The one was a greke^ The other a Jew.
And the therde a sarasyn. of whom the said king desirid. that ych of them would
utter some good and notable sentence. Than the Greek said I may well correct
and amend my thoughtis / but not my words. Than the Jew sayd^ I have
meruayll of them. that say things prejudicial. where silence were more
prouff^table. And the sarasyn sayd^ I am master over my words. or it be
pronunced / but when it is spoken I am servant thereto. And It was axed one of
them Who might be called a king / And he ansuerd^ He that is not subgett to his
own ^^^ll And Assaron said to an evil payer that desired to borowe money of
him. that he would leave him none. for I know well that he cowde not displease
him somoch in refusing the love. as in axyng him his payement again And said.
The wysemen speak with good deliberacion^ and the foooles speak without
aduisement And Teofrates said he is of good condition that reports and
says good of other folkis / and keeps secret their defaultes And it was axed
of disconie what thingis were most necessary for aman to keep him out of other
folkis danger And he ansuerd If he be rich to live moderately. and if he be
pouer to labor dylygentely And Nycomake said there is not so good adoctour /
as dis^recion / ne so good aprecher as the time / and he that correctith him
by other is right diligent and well occupied / And it is bettir (...) take
exemple by other than other to take yt by him And Thymetus said / meddle nor
undertake not with the governance of a fool. for he can not peyse nor
conceive / what good thou do to him / no more than a horse or other beestis
take heed whedre they charge him with gold or gravel / and yt was axed of
Aathelyn / why men ben punisshed for their misdeeds. and not for their
thoughts. He said their thoughts aren reserved only to god And Amenyus said
/ there be.iij. thyngis that a prince ought to eschew. The first is to much
drynking. The second is to much delectacion in musyk^ And the therde dotyng
of women / for these ^iij^ thyngis put awey all his other good thoughts And
said thought for thingis lost and evil done. that can not be amended foryeting
thereof is the medycine And said troth is good to be said. and specially when
it prouffiteth every body / And sayde^ If thou can not atteyn to the wysedom of
ancient men at the lest study and see there bookis and sum profyt thou
maeyst have thereby And quidarius said I have marvel of thoes that blame so
much the foul thingis upon other and think hem fair upon hem self /
Dimycrates said patience is a castle imprenable and worship is the fruit of
troth and repentance is the fruit of haast / And it was axid of dithomages /
why the rich men be more proud than wysemen / and h^ said for the wysemen
known and dreede our lord and understand what offense pride is unto him. but
the rich man takes none head therto^ And some axed of him which was bettir to
have sapience or richesse^ And he said. there is no good richesse / but it be
aswele proffytable in the other world as in this^ but sapie^ce is good for
either worlde^ It was told Aristotle's that a man had said good of him^ And he
said I shall recompense it / They axed him In what manner. And he said I will

Tales mylostius said / I have great marvel of them that for wordely goods

Pyctagoras said / Science has non enemies / but ygnorant men And said /
clateringe of folies is displeysir to wysemen / Like as the stenche of a kareyn
is to them that smell it / for the fool knows no more the fawte of his
speech than the kareyn does of his stenche / And it was axed of another how
men might keep him from much drynking / And he ansuerd in beholding well the
great Inconuenientis that be fall the dronken men And Eugene said / Many

/ the great prouffyt that I have found in sapience Is that I have composed and

thoughts / he ought to remember the things perpetuel And said some think it
good / that every body were of like condition but thinks the contrary / for
then every man would command and non obey And demepates said when thou

their dr^nken ship hate all fair and good virtues / and louen all vic^s and
filthis but when his dronkenship is passed he is ashamed of his dedis And said
A king of good wit and discrecion ought to be well content and pleasid /
when men offer him their seriuce And ought in his peace and prosperice to
worship and cherisshe his knyghtis and men of werre and to pay them well their
wages. all be it he wene to have none ennemyes^ for he can not be sure / how

the laudable Rychesses ben thoes^ that duren perpetuelly And Brakalyke said
The covetous man. has no rest. And the nygard may never be Rich And Phelype
king of Macedone said to thoes that counseylled him to bren the Cite of
Athenes. when he had won it. We should than seem men dyscounfyt. where we

what lost thou shall have / if thou lake a true friend / if thy house falls

said when aman is in great Ire and wrath / he may be likened to an house taken
with fire in which / for the qua^tite of the smoke and of the noise of the
fiere / there may no man se ne here therein / and may also be likened to a ship
in an outrageous tempest in the sea / which will not be well condyted nor
stered for the feruentnesse of the same tempest / and so when a man's blood
and courage is stored with wrath and Ire / there may no persuasions nor holsom
counseil avail nor stere him to his proufit / and is so cursid that alitil
spark of hit makith lightly a great fiere / yet wrath is many atyme pacefied
by silence / as the fiere quenchith when the brondis be taken awey / Also a
droncken man can not perceive his dronkenship til he be sobre / and after when
he seth another droncken / he knows thereby in what caas he was in / Also the
angered man retourneth by his patience and sees another angry / may well
perceive his own defawtes And said. We se commonly women sonner angry than men
/ the seek men rather than the hole. the old man lightlyer than the yonge^
wherefore it is to be thought that wrath comes of feblenesse of courage. And a
maistre rebuked his clerck seeing / hold thy peace bondemans sone And he
ansuerde. I am not the less worth for my kynne But thou art the wors for thy
conditions And said A wyseman ought to say that / that is convenient and
sometime to here that / that is not to be said And said there is nothing that
greueth somoche thy friend / as to show him that thou have him suspect And
said Company and dele so with the people / that they wische after thy
presense. when thou art absent / and that they lament and bewail thy death /
Aman wept when his soon was b^ren / And it was axed of him why he wept and
ought rather to be ioyeful / And he ansuerd I weep for my sone that goth now
toward his death / And it was axed of him what manner people be leest behated /
And he ansuerd thoo that may another help nor hurt and that does another good nor
harm / for the evil people hate the good / and the good hate the evil And
said Custume is harder to break than nature And said there ben / ij / manner of

And said. Short remembrance and hastenesse of speech makes many a time man
fail and err in his Judgment And one Rebuked a wiseman / To the which the
wyseman said. Thou rebukes me not of all my vices. And It was axid of him^
why he would have no sone / he ansuerd I had lever be without. for when I
behold the grette love that aman has to his child and the grette peynes and
troubles he has to bring him up. and at last must lose him^ that sorrow were
more to me / than the Joy It was advised one that was going in a far vyage /
that he should not hold his Iurney / lest he dyed the rin^ And he ansuerd That
death is all one to me / be it in other Countrees or at home And It was axed of
another what thing is not to be don / though it be just and true. And he
ansuerd / aman ought not to praise him self of any of his good dedis And
said It is sometime good to spare the sothe for to give hope to his enemies /
and to save his frendis from death for troth needs not always to be said /
And it was axid of him what thing was most delectable / And he ansuerd that one
is not sure to keep long in one degree and is most difficile to be found And
said Aman that desires to come to any grette well / ought not to leave it

awitty prince may help him in his wars aswele with bad people as with good

one was blamed because he had yeuen his silver to an evil person. being in

cause he was in necessite And said excercite of diverse labors is health and

ansuerd. sithen the time that I began to disprayse and mystryst my self he

arowe is salvation / his knyghthode is the counseylle of wysemen. his
ornamentis ben strength. his tresoure is discipline. his love is the company
of good people / his love and al his desir is to fle sin and to serve and
love god And said A grette tresour is to have frendys and is a noble affection
/ wherefore it is convenient to cherisshe and keep hem well / and to win one
by another as often as birds dra^wen many into her company And a king axid of a
wys^man whom he reputed to be a good Judge / And he ansuerd He that is not
deceived by flateries / that is not corrupt by yeftes^ and is not deceived for
fawte of discrecion And another said Sclandrers ben wors than thieves / for
thieves stele but the goods and sclandrers take and dystroye love And another
said worship yeuen without cause at last tourneth to shame And another said
It were better to be in company and conuersaunt with a serpent. than with an
evil woman And said one ought to doubt the subtilltees and crafts of his
ennemy if he be wise / and if he be a fool than dread his folies And another
said / the most liberal in this world is he that reputed for a great thing the
good dedis that be don to him / and that he reputed for litil that he has don
to other / and that holds him content with that he has be he pouer or rich

world and freteth and wereth it as the filth of a gouge does the iron / And
another said / like as no thing may be written in a peyre of tables all ready
written in without the first writing be put out / All in like wise the virtues
and noblesses may not be had in no body withouten the vices and
wrecchednesses ben firstput awey And another said like as aman may not all at
ones^ by hold with one eye the sky / and with other the earth / In like wise
aman may not arredye and dispose his wit to virtues / and to vices to gyder
And another said the right stedefaste love is when the frendis ben of like
conditions / and if they be diverse or contrarious uneath that love may long
endure And said people ought to dowte their king and him obey with fere and in
loue^ And some axed him when the wit of man was parfeyte / And he said when
that he speaks truth And another said the enuiou^ hates the liberal / and
the nygarde is wr^th with that another spends / And another said all getting
may not be justified ne health may not be glotonie / ne fre^deship with
decepcion^ ne noblesse with badde discipline ne love with pride ne justice with
necessite ne rest of heart with envy ne wit and discrecion with vengeance
nor process without conseil And another said trust not afoole another for love

bittre and noyng to the and his words sweet and curtoys / And another said the
wysemen endure here all their lives lasting / and aft^r their death their good
works shall lasten in me^nes minds / And another said consideracion of the
end of the workis helps much to the good conclusion / And another said
thou ought to love though thou be not loved And another said afoole w^neth
ever that god has no thing well don nor employed / but that he has yeuen him
and seems that he cowde have made and ordeigned this world bettir than god
has don / how be it he can not goune his own person only And another said
be willing to give the nedy people / and in so doing thou shall do service and
pleaser to our lord god And another said bettir is aman to hold his peace
than to contrary and argue with a fool / and is as good to have the ennemyte
of bad people as their frendeship / and the hard and the sharp life in well
doyng^ is bettir than the swettest in doing evil dedis / and it is bettir to be
withou^e fame than to have hit bad / and pouerte is bettir than the riches of
keyteyues / and the pour man without vices is bettir than the rich man that
is worshipped for his sins And another said It were bettir not to know an
iniust king than to be his conseyllour. or next in his g^ce And another said If
thou give for to have fame only thereby / that is not liberalite for thou do
it but for thyn own avail And another said He is of no laudable life that is
not this day as good or bettir / as he was the day passed And another said thou
shall not mow have that / that thou desire without that thou bear pacie^tly
the greues that thou would not have And another said a mien shall be in thy
hands as long as he shall trust the / And it was axid of a wyseman / why he
desired not to have a sone / he ansuerde. because that I have had enough ado
for to chastyse my body and to adresse my saul without having any other

him in this world. And he ansuerd / The wyseman at his death / by cause that he
has not wrought after sapyence and he that has done good to an unkind man
And it was axed of him / what thing encresed the law / He ansuered troth. And
what sustyneth troth / Reason and wit and whereby is wit governed / by
keeping of the tongue / and how is the tongue kept / with patience / what causes
patience dred of god. and what causes dred of god -Often to speak and remember
death / and to considere and know his frailnes And another said superfluyte
makes the body seek wyn troublith the wit / wrath is contrary to wysdom /
but te^perance conforteth the heart / and put aweye all heuinesse and causith
health And said how be it that a wyiseman be of low kynred yet is he noble /
and though he be astranger he should be worshipped / and though he be pouer yet
the people have need of him And another said he that endures / and takes no
pain in his youth restith him not in his aage And another said the error of a
fool yeueth litil rest to his thoughtis And another said the tongue of
adiscrete man is in his heart and the heart of a fool is in his tongue / And
another said not withstanding thy nature use enermore good and laudable
conditions / And another said aman ought co^tinuelly to enquere what men say of
him and where in they lawde him and where in they blame him / if they lawde him
he to give that cawse continuelly without pride thereof and if they blame him /
he to beware from falling any more to that caas and not to hate hem for their
auertissement And said he is wise that is humble and meke in his might and
pouoir: And when he is in great astate to dysprayse the world / and is
attemperate in great auctorite. And one desired of a wyseman to tell him the
difference bytwyx this world and the other world. And he ansuerd / this world

And another said I have acompayned me with the rich men and have seen their
rich arraye clohtinge and other thingis better than mine were. where upon I had
such envy and melancolye that I might have no rest in my self / Than I
acompayned me with pouer men / like as I was. and than I was satisfied and in

And another said. As the goodness of wysemen goth evermore in amending / In
like wise goth the malices of the fools every day in empayring And another
said If thou correct a wyseman. he shall thank the therefore / and if thou teache

governor of a wyseman is patience and the governor of a fool is pride
Andanother said aman that is slowthful in his werkis is co^monely envious of
the well of other men And another said It is good to enquere twies of things
unknown / for the first question is of will / and the second is of
discrecion And another said troth i^ gods messager wherefore she must be
worshipped for the love of her master And another said / he that multiplieth
^^^s temporal goods dyminueth his espu^alles / And another said thoos that
believe and dread god stedfastlye have not delectacion but only in him and in
his werkis And another said the most laudable werkis that one may do is to
obey the maundeme^tes and pleaser of our lord god / and the work of the body
Ioigned to the work of the heart is more laudable than the work of the heart
only And another said the evil creatures been wors than serpents lions or
caraynes / And in like wise as upon the earth / there is nothing bettir than the
good creatures / Right so there is no thing wors. than thoos that be wykked And
another said he that takes upon him higher astate / than to him bilongith /
puts great peyn to be evil spoken of And a another said he that will have
rest in his lyffe / ought to keep him from ^iiij^ occasions / the first is
that he ought not to be wroth though some creature live / which he would have
deed / second is if some ^ye which he would have alive / the therde is. if he
has not that / that he desires. and the fourth is if he see that fortune
raise and bring up somother of lower degree than he is And another said to
entermedle and dele litill with wo^^^ely werkis is a thing that may best keep
aman from all inco^ueinentis And another said the more a wyseman is alone the
greter is his Joy be it day or night And another said the evil disposed king
is like a caraygne yt makes the earth stenke about it / and the good king is
like the fayer re^nyng ryuire that is prouffytable to the creature And another
said The wysemen ar not content to prouffyte only them self / but semblably do
aua^tage to other / and the fools hurt not only them self / but rather take
great labor to hurt and trouble other folks And another said / afoole for a
litil thing exposes him lightly to fortune And said thou may not be so well

another said / he that yeueth conscile and praysith it him self would feyn be

sayenges aforsayd for as much as they specifye of other matters / And also
desired me that don to put the said book in enprinte. And thus obeying his
request and commandment I have put me in deuoyr to ouersee this his said book
and beholden as nyghe as I could how It accords with thorigynal being in
Frensh. And I find nothing dyscordaunt therein. Sauf only in the dyctes and
sayengys of Socrates. Wherein I find that my said lord has left out certain
and dyuerce conclusions towchyng women. Whereof I meruaylle that my said lord
has not wreton them ne what has meuyd him so to do Ne what cause he had at
that tyme^ But I suppose that some fair lady has desired him to leave it out of
his book Or else he was amerous on sum noble lady. for whose love he would
not set yt in his book. or else for the very affection. love and good will
that he has unto all ladies and Gentylwomen. he thought that Socrates spared
the sothe. And wrote of women more than truth. which I can not think that
so true aman and so noble a Phylosophre as Socrates was should write other wise
than trouthe^ For If he had made fawte in writing of women. He ought not ne
should not be believed in his other dyctes and sayings. But I apperceyue that my
said lord knows verily that such defautes ben not had ne founden in the
women born and dwelling in these parties ne Regyons of the world^ Socrates was
a Greek boren in a far Contre from hens. Which contre is all of othre
condycions than this is. And men and women of other nature than they ben here
in this contre For I wot well. of what someuer condition women ben in Greece.
the women of this contre ben right good / wise / playsant / humble / discrete /
sobre / chaste / obedient to their husbondis / true / secret / steadfast / ever
besy / and never idle / Attempe rat in speking / and virtuous in all their
werkis. or act lest should be so / For which causes so euydent my said lord
as I suppose thought it was not of necessite to set in his book the saiengis
of his Auctor socrates touching women But for as much as I had coma^deme^t of
my said lord to correct and amend where as I should find fawte / and other
find I none sauf that he has left out these dicte^ ^ saynges of the women of
Greece / Therefore in accomplisshi^g his commandment for as much as I am not in
certain wheder it was in my lordis copye or not^ or ellis perauentu^^^ that the
wind had blow over the leef / at the time of ^^^a^slacion of his book / I
purpose to write tho same sayng^^^ of that Greek Socrates / which wrote of tho
women of greece and nothing of them of this Royame / whom I s^^^pose he never
knew / For if he had I dar plainly say that he would have reserved them
inespeciall in his said dictes Always not presumyng to put and set them in my
said lords book / but inthende aparte in the rehersayll of the werkis humbly
requiryng al them that shall read this lytyl rehersayll that if they find any
fault tarette it to Socrates and not to me which writes as here after
follows

SOcrates said That women ben thapparaylles to cacche men / but they take none
but them that will be pour / or else them that know hem not And he said that
there is none so great empeshement unto aman as Ignorance / and women And he
saw a woman that bare fire / of whom he said that the hotter bare the colder
And he saw a woman seek. of whom he said that the evil restyth and dwellyth
with the evil And he saw a woman brought to the Justice. and many other women
followed her weping / of whom he said. the evil ben sorry and angry because the
evil shall perisshe And he saw a Iong maid that learned to write / of whom he
sayde^ that me multiplied evil upon evil And he said that the Ignorance of a
man is known in three things That is to wete / When he has no thought to use
reason When he can not refrain his couetises / And when he is governed by the
conceyll of women in that he knows that they know not And he said unto his
dyscyples Will ye that I enseygne and teache you / how ye shall mo we escape
from all evil / And they ansuerd / ye / And then he said to them / For
what someuer thing that it be. keep you and be well waar that ye obey not to
women Who ansuerd to him again. And what say thou by our good moders and of
our susters / He said to hem / Suffice you / with that I have said to you. For
all ben semblable in malice And he said / who someuer will acquere and get
science / late him never put him in the governance of a woman And he saw a
woman that made her fresshe and gaye. to whom he said / Thou resemblest the
fire / For the more wode is leyd to the fire the more wo^e it brenne / And the
gretter is the hete And on a time one axyd him / what him seemed of women^ He
ansuerd That the women resemble unto a Tree called Edelfla Which is the fairest
tree to behold and see that may be But within it is full of venym And they said
to him and demanded wherefore he blamed so women / and that he him self had not
comen into this world ne none other men also without hem. He ansuerd^ The
woman is like unto a Tree named Chassoygnet. on which tree there ben many things
sharp and pryckyng. which hurt and prycke them that approach unto hit. And
yet nevertheless that same tree brings forth good dates and swete^ And they
demanded him / why he fled from the women. And he ansuerd. For as much as I
see them flee and eschew the good^ and comenly do evil And a woman said to
hym^ wylt thou have any other woman than me And he ansuerde to her Art not
thou ashamed toffre thy self to him. that demands ner desires the not

LO these ben the dictes and sayengis of the phylosophre Socrates which he
wrote in his book / And certainly he wrote no worse than before is rehearsed And
for asmoche as it is acordau^t. that his dyctes and sayengis should be had as
well as others therefore I have set it in the end of this book / And also sum
persons perauenture that have red this book in frensshe would have arette a
grette defaulte in me that I had not do my deuoir in visiting and ouerseeyng of
my lords book acording to his desir / And sum other also happily might have
supposed that Socrates had wreton much more ylle of women than here before is
specified / wherefore in satisfyeng of all parties and also for excuse of the
said socrates I have set these said dyctes and sayengis a part in the end
of this book / to thente^t that if my said lord or any other person what
someuer he or she be that shall read or here it / that If they be not well plesyd
with all that they with a pen race it out or else rent the leef out of the
book / Humbly requyryng and besechyng my said lord to take no displaysir on me
so presumyng but to pardone where as he shall find fault / and that it plese
him to take the labor of thenpryntyng in gre and thank / which gladly have
don my dyligence in thaccomplysshyng of his desire and commandment / In which
I am bounden so to do for the good reward that I have resseyuyd of his said
lordship / Whom I beseech Almighty god tencrece and to continue in his virtuous
disposicion in this world / And after this life to live euerlastyngly in heaven
Amen
