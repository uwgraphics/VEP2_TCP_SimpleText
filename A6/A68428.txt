Le assemble de dyeus


Here begins the Temple of glass
FOr thought constreynt and grievous heaviness
For pensyfhed and high distres
To bed I went now this other night
when that lucyna with her pale light
was Joined last with phoebus in aquarye
Amyd decembre / when of Ianuarye
There be kalendes of the new year
And derke dyane horned and nothing clear
Had her beams under a mysty cloud
wish in my bed for cold I began me shroude
All desolate for constraynt of my woo
The long night walowyng to and fro
Till at last er I began take keep
Me did oppress a sodeyn dedly sleep
with in the which me thought I was
Rauysshed in spirit in to a Temple of glass
I nyste how far in wyldernes
That founded was as by lyclynes
Not upon stele / but on a craggy roche
Like yse I frore / and as I did approach
Again the son that shone so clear
As any crystal and ever nere and nere
As I began nyghe this grysly dreadful place
I wex astonyed / the light so in my face
Began to smite / so persyng ever in one
On every part where that I began gone
That I ne might no thing as I would
About me consydere and behold
The wonder estres for bryghtnes of the son
Till at last certain skies done
with wind chaced han her course I went
Tofore the stremes of tytan and I blent
So that I might within and without
wherso I would beholden me about
For to report the facyon and manner
Of all this place that was circuler
In compass wise / round by entayle wrought
And when I had long gone and sought
I found a wyket and entered in as fast
In to the temple and mine eyes cast
On every side now low and now eft alofte
And right anon as I began walken soft
if I the so^he a right report shall
I saw depaynted upon a wall
From este to weste many a fair image
Of sundry lovers like as they were of age
Isette in order after they were true
with lyfly colors wonder fresh of hue
And as me thought I saw some sit and some stand
And some knelyng with bylles in their hand
And some with complaynt woeful and pyetous
with doleful chere to putten to venus
So as she sat fletyng in the sea
Upon her woo for to have pytee
And first of all I saugh there of cartage
Dido the queen so goodly of vysage
That began complain her adventure and caas
How she deceived was of Eneas
For all his hestes and his oaths sworn
And said alas that ever she was borne
when she saw that ded she must be
And next I saw the complaynt of Medee
How that she falsed was of Jason
And nygh by venus saw I sytte Atheon
And all the manner how the boor him slough
For whom she wept and had pyne enough
There saw I also how that Penolope
For she so long her lord ne might see
was of color both pale and grene
And al there next was the fresh queen
I mean Alcest the noble true wife
And for admete how she lost her life
And for her troth if I shall not lie
How she was turned in to a daysye
There was Grssyldes Innocence
And all her mekenes and pacyence
There was eke I soude and many other moo
And all the torment and the cruel woo
That she had for trystram all her live
And how that Tisbe her heart did ryue
with thylke swerd of sir Pyramus
And all the manner how that Theseus
The mynotaure slow amyd the house
That was for wrynked by craft of dedalus
when he was in prison shit in Crete
And how that philles felt of loves hete
The great fire of demephon allas
And for his falshed and for his trespass
Upon the walls depeynt men might see
How she henge upon a fylberd tree
And many a story moo than I rekene can
were in the temple / and how that paris wan
The fair Eleyne a lusty fresh queen
And how achylles was for Polycene
I slain vnwardly within troy town
All this law I walkyng up and down
There saw I wreton eke the hole tale
How philomene in to a nyghtyngale
I turned was / and proigne unto a swalowe
And how the sabyns in their manner halowe
The feste of lucresse yet in Rome town
There saw I also the sorrow of palamon
That he in prison felt and all the smert
And how that he through unto his heart
was hurt vnwaarly by castyng of an eye
On fair fresh the lusty young Emelye
And all the stryf between him and his brother
And how that one faught with that other
within the grove / till they by theseus
Accorded were as Chaucer tells us
And furthermore as I began behold
I saw how phoebus with an arowe of gold
I wounded was through out his side
Only by envy of the god Cupide
And how that diane unto a laurer tree
I turned was when that she did flee
And how that Jove began to change his cope
Only for love of the fair Europe
And in to a bulle / when he did her sue
List of his godhed his form to transmewe
And how that he by transmutacyon
The shap began take of Amphitryon
For Alcumena so passing was of beante
So was he hurt for all his deyte
with louys dart / and might it not escape
There saw I also how mars was take
Of vulcanus and with venus found
And with the cheynes / Inuysible bound
There was also all the Poesye
Of him Mercurye and all the Philogye
And how that she for her sapience
I wedded was to the god of eloquence
And how the Muses lowly did obey
High in to heuyn this lady to conueye
And with her song how she was magnefyed
with Iubyter there to be stellefyed
And vppermore depaynt men might see
How with her ryng the goodly canace
Of every foul / the leydons and song
Could vndstond as she walked them among
And how her brother so often helped was
In his myschyef / by the stead of bras
And furthermore in the temple were
Full many a thousand lovers here and there
In sundry wise ready to complain
Unto the goddess / of her woo and pain
How they were hyndred some for envy
And how the serpent of falls Iolousye
Full many a lover has put a back
And causeles on them have leyd a lack
And some there were that playned on absence
That were exiled and put out of presence
Through wicked tongues and falls suspeccyon
without mercy or any remissyon
And other also her seruyse spent in vayn
And of her lady were not loved again
And also other that for pouerte
Dursten in no wise her great aduersyte
Discouere ne open / leest they were refused
And some for wantyng also were accused
And also other that loved secretly
And of her lady durst axe no mercy
Leest that she would of him have despyte
And some also that putten right great wit
On double lovers that love things new
Through whose falsenes hyndred be the true
And some there were as it is often found
That for her lady many a blody wound
Endured has in many a regyon
whiles that an other has had possessyon
All of his lady and bears a way the fruit
Of his labor and of all his suyt
And other complained of Richesse
How he with tresour does his business
To win against all kind and right
where as true lovers have no force ne might
And some there were as maidens young of age
That playnen so with pipyng and with rage
That were coupled again all nature
with crooked old that may not long endure
For to perform the lust of loves play
For hit ne sit not unto fresshe may
For to be coupled to old Ianuarye
They be so diverse that they must varye
For old is grutchyng and malencolyous
Ay full of ire and suspecyous
And yought entendeth to Joy and lustynes
To mirth and play and to all gladness
Alas that ever hit should fall
So sweet sugre ycoupled be to galle
Thise young folk cryeden often sithe
And prayed venus her power to kythe
Upon this myschyef and shape remedy
And right anon I herd other cry
with sobbyng teres and pyetous sown
To fore the goddess by lamentacyon
That were constrained in their youth
And in childhode as is often couthe
I entryd were in to relygyon
Or they had years of discrecyon
That all her life can not but complayn
In wide copes perfeccyon for to feign
Full covertly for to coueren their smert
And show the contrary of their heart
Thus saw I weep many a fair maid
That on their friends all the wit they laid
And other next I saw there in great rage
That they were married in their tender age
without fredome of free eleccyon
where love has selde domynacyon
For love at large and at lyberte
would freely chese and not with such trete
And other saw I full often weep and wrynge
That they in men fond such varyenge
To love a season while that beaulte flourith
And after by disdayn so ungoodly lourith
On her that whilom he called his lady dear
That was to him so pleysaunt and entyer
But lust with fayrnes is so ouergoon
That in her heart truth abides noon
And som^e also I saw in teres reyne
And pyetously on god and kind pleyne
That ever they would on any creature
So much beauty passing by mesure
Set on a woman to give occasion
A man / to love to his confusion
And namely there / where he shall have no grace
For with a look forth by as he does pace
Full often falls through castyng of an eye
A man is wounded that he must nedis deye
That never perauenture after he shall her see
why will god do so great a cruelte
To any man / or to his creature
To make him so much woo endure
For her / percas / whom he shall in no wise
Rejoice never / but so forth in Iuyse
Led his life till that he be in his grave
For he ne durst of her no mercy crave
And also perauenture though he durst and would
He can not wit where he her find should
I saw there also / and thereof had I routhe
That som^e were hyndred by couetyse and slouthe
And some also for their hastynes
And other also for their rechelesnes
But at the last as I walked and beheld
Beside pallas with her crystal shield
Tofore the statute of venus set on heyght
There kneled a lady in my sight
Tofore the goddess / which as the son
Passes the sterrys / and also the storms done
And lucyfer to void the nyghtes sorrow
In clerenes passes erly the morrow
And so as May has the souereynte
Of every month the fayrnes and beauty
And as the Rose in swetnes and odor
Surmounteh tloures / and bame of all lycour
Has the pryse / and as the rubye bright
Of all stones in beauty and in sight
As it is know has the Regalye
Right so this lady with her goodly eye
And with the stremes of her look so bright
Surmounteth all thourgh beauty in my sight
That for to tell her great semelynes
Her womanhed her port and her fayrnes
Hit was a marvel / how ever that nature
Cowde in her works make a creature
So angelyk so goodly one to see
So femynyn or passing of beauty
whose sonnysshe here bryghter than goldwyre
Lyche phoebus beams shynyng in his spyre
The goodlyhed also of her fresshe face
So replenyshed of beauty and of grace
So well ennewed by nature and depeynt
As Rose and lylyes to gyder were meynt
So egally by good proporcyon
That as me thought by mine inspeccyon
I began meruaylle how god or work of kind
Myghten of beauty such a tresour find
Te yeuen her so passing excellence
For in good faith through her hye presence
The temple was enlumyned enuyron
And for to speak of her condicyon
She was the best that might be on live
For there was none yt with her might strive
To speak of bounte or of gentylnesse
Of womanhede or of lowlynesse
Of curtesye or of goodlyhede
Of speech of chere or of semelyhede
Of poort benygne or of dalyaunce
The best taught and thereto of pleysaunce
She was the well also of honest
An examplayr and myrrour also was she
Of secretnes / of truth / of faythfulnes
And to all other lady and maystres
To show virtue who so list to lere
And so this lady right humble of chere
^rnelyng I saw / clad in grene and white
To fore venus goddess of all delight
Enbrowded all with stones and perre
So rychely that Joy it was to see
with sundry rolls on her garnement
For texpowne the troth of her intent
To show fully that for her humblesse
And for her virtue and her stablenesse
That she was rote of all womanly pleysau^ce
Therefore her word / without varyau^ce
Enbrowded as men might see
De mieulx en mieulx with stones of perre
This is to said that she was so benygne
From better to better her heart does resygne
And all her will to venus the goddess
when that her list her harms to redress
For as me thought sommhat by her chere
For to complain she had great desire
For in her hand she held a little bylle
For to declare the su^me of all her will
And to the goddess her quarrel for to show
Theffect of which was in words sewe
The copye of the supplycacyon.
O lady Venus Mother of Cupide
That all this world have in governance
And hertes hye that hawten by pride
Enclynest mekely to thyn obeyssau^ce
Causer of Joy Relees of penance
And with thy stremes can every thing discern
Through heavenly fire of love that is eterne
O blesfull sterre persaunt and full of light
Of beams gladsom / deuoyder of derkenes
Chyef recomfort after the black night
To void woeful hertes out of their heaviness
Take now good head lady and goddess
So that my bylle may your grace atteyne*
Redress to find of that I me complain
For I am bound to thing that I nolde
Freely to chese there lack I lyberte
And so I want of that mine heart would
The body is knyt / though my thought be free
So that I must of necessyte
My hertes list outward contrary
Though we be oon the deed must varye
My worship sauf I faylle eleccyon
Again all right both of god and kind
Thereto be knyt under subieccyon
Fro whens fer both ar out of mind
My thought gooth fourth my body is behind
For I am here / and yond my remembrance
Between two so hang I in balance
Deuoyde of Joy / of woo I have plente
what I desire / that may I not possede
For that I nolde is ready ay to me
And that I love / for to sue I dread
To my desire contrary is my mede
And thus I stand departed in tweyne
Of will and deed ylaced in a cheyne
For though I brenne with feruence and hete
within mine heart I mote complain of cold
And by excess though I swelte and sweet
Me to complain god wot I am not bold
Unto no wight / nor one word unfold
Of all my pain / alas the hard stounde
The hotter yt I brenne / the colder is my wound
For he that has mine heart faithfully
And hool my love in all honest
without change all be hit secretly
I have no space with him for to be
O lady venus consider now and see
Unto theffecte and complaynt of my byll
Sith life and death I put all in thy will
And tho me thought the gods did enclyne
Mekely her head and softly began express
That in short time her torment should fine
And how of him for whom all her distress
Continued had and all her heaviness
She should have Joy and of her purgatory
Be helped soon and so live forth in glory
And said daughter for thy sad truth
Thy faithful menyng and Innocence
That planted be with outen any slouthe
In your person deuoyde of all offense
So han atteyned to our audyence
That with our grace ye shall be well releuyd
I you behete of all that has you greuyd
And for that ye be ever of one intent
without change or mutabilyte
And in your pains ben so pacyent
To take lowly your aduersyte
And that so long through the cruelte
Of old saturn my fader vnfortuned
your woo shall now no longer be contuned
And thinks this within a little while
Hit shall aswage and over passen soon
For men by laysir passen many a mile
And often after a drepyng moan
The weder clereth / and when the storm is done
The son shyneth in his spyre bright
And Joy waketh when woo is put to flight
Remember eke how never yet no wight
Ne cam^ to worship without some debate
And folk rejoice also more of light
That they with derkenes were waped and mate
No man's chance is allewaye fortunate
Ne no wight prayseth of sugre the swetnes
But they toforeh aue tasted bytternes
Grysyld was asayed at full
That turned after to encrese of Joy
Penolope began eke for sorrows dulle*
For that her lord abode so long at troy
Also the torment there could no man accoye
Of dorygene flour of all Bretaygne
Thus ever Joy is fyn and end of pain
And trusts this for conclusyon
The end of sorrow is Joy void of dread
For holy saints through her passion
Have heuyn won by their souerayn mede
And plente gladly followed after need
And so my daughter after your greuaunce
I you behote ye shall have full plesaunce
For ever of love the manner and the gyse
Is for to hurt his servant and to wound
And when he has taught them his empryse
He can in Joy make them to habounde
And since that ye have in my laas be bound
without grutchyng or rebellyon
ye must of right have consolacyon
This is to said dowteth never a deell
That ye shall have full possessyon
Of him that ye now cherysshe so well
In honest manner with out offencyon
By cause I know your entencyon
Is truly set in party and in all
To love him best and most in special
For he that ye have chosen you to serve
Shall be to you such as ye desire
without change fully ^yll he sterue
So with my brond I have set him a fire
And with my grace I shall him enspyre
That he in heart shall be right at your will
whether ye list to save him or to spyll.
For unto you I shall his heart so low
without spotte of any doblenesse
That he ne shall escape from the bow
Though that him self by unsteadfastness
I mean of cupyde that shall him so distress
Unto your hand with tharowe of gold
That he ne shall escape though he would
And sith ye list of pity and of grace
In virtue only his youth to cherysshe
I shall by aspecte of my benygne face
Make him teshewe every sin and vice
So that he shall have no manner spyce
In his courage to love things new
He shall to you so plain be found and true
And when this goodly fair fresshe of hue
Humble and benygne of troth crop^ and rote
Conceyned had how venus began to rewe
On her prayer plainly to do bote
To change her bitter attones in to lote
She fill on knees of high devotion
And in this wise began her oryson
Highest of hye queen and Emperes
Goddess of love / of good yet the best
That through your beauty without vice
whylom conquered thappell at fest
That Iubyter through his hye request
To all the gods above celestyall
Made in his palace most Imperyall
To you my lady vpholder of my life
Mekely I thank so as I may suffyse
That ye list now with heart ententyf
So gracyously for me to deuyse
That while I live with humble sacrefyse
Upon your awters your fest year by year
I shall encence cast in to the fire
For of your grace I am full reconsyled
From every trouble unto Joy and ease
That sorrows all be from me exyled
Sith ye my lady list now tappease
My pains old and fully my disease
Unto gladness so suddenly to torn
Having no cause from hensforth to morn
For sythen ye so mekely list to daunte
To my seruyse him that loves me best
And of your bounte so gracyously to grant
That he ne shall varye though him list
whereof my heart is fully brought to rest
For now and ever o lady my benygne
That heart and will I holy to you resygne
Thankyng you with all my full heart
That of your grace and vysitacyon
So humbly list him to convert
Fully to be at my subieccyon
without change or transmutacyon
Unto his last / now laud and reverence
Be to your name and excellence
This all and su^me and chyef of my request
And hooll substance of my full intent
you thankyng ever of your grant and hest
Both now and ever that ye me grace sent
To conquer him that never shall repent
Me for to serve and humbly for to please
As fynall tresour of my hertes ease
And then anon venus cast a down
In to her lap brasiches white and grene
Of hawthorn that went enuyron
About her heed that Joy was to seen
And bad her keep hem honestly and clean
which should not fade ne never wexe old
If she her biddyng keep as she has told
And as these bows be both fair and sweet
Follow theffecte that they do specyfye
This is to said both in cold and hete
Be ye of one heart and of one fantasye
As arn these leaves which may not dye
By no duresse of storms that been kene
No More in winter than in somer grene
Right so by ensample of well or woo
For Joy torment or for aduersyte
whether so fortune favor / or be foo
For pouert riches or prosperyte
That ye your heart keep in one degree
To love him best for no thing that ye feign
whom I have bound so low under your chain
And with ye word the goddess shoke her head
And was in pees and spoke as tho no more
And therewith all full femynyn of dread
Me thought this lady syghen began full sore
And said again / lady that may restore
Hertes in Joy from their aduersyte
To do your will de mieulx en mieulx ma gree
Thus ever slepyng dremyng as I lay
within the temple me thought I say
Great prees of folk with murmr wonderful
To croude and shoue / the temple was so full
Eueryche full besy / in his own cause
That I ne may shortly in a clause
Discryuen all the rytes and the guyse
And eke I want connyng to deuyse
How some there were with blood encence and milk
And some with flowers sote and soft as sylke
And some with sparowes and douues white
That for to offren began hem delight
Unto the goddess with syghe and prayer
Hem to relese of that they most desire
That for the prees shortly to conclude
I went my way for the multitude
Me for to refresshe out of the prees aloue
And by my self me thought as I began goone
within the estres and began a while tarry
I saw a man that walked all solytarye
That as me seems for heaviness and dole
Him to complain / that he walked so sole
without espyeng of any other wight
And if I shall discryue him aryght
If that he had not be in heaviness
Me thought he was / to speak of semelynes
Of shap of form / and also of stature
The most passing / that ever yet nature
Made in her works / and like to be a man
And therewith all as I reherce can
Of face and chere the most gracyous
To be byloued happy and ewrous
But as it seemed outward by his chere
That he complained for lack of his desire
For by him self as he walked up and down
I herd him make a lamentacyon
And said alas / what thing may this be
That now am bound that whilom was fre
And went at large at mine eleccyon
Now am I caught under subieccyon
For to become a very homager
To god of love / where or I came here
Felt in mine heart / naught of loves pain
But now of new / within her fyry chain
I am enbraced so that I may not strive
To serve and love while I am on live
The goodly fresse in the temple yonder
I saw right now / that I had wonder
How ever god / for to rekene all
Might make a thing so celestyall
So angelyke on earth to appear
For with the stremes of her eyes clear
I am wounded even to the heart
That fro the death I may not astert
And most I marvel that so suddenly
I was so yolde to be at her mercy
whether that she list me to live or deye
without more / I must her lust obey
And take mekely my sodeyn adventure
For sith my life / my death / and eke my cure
Is in her hand it will not auaylle
To grutche again / for of this bataylle
The palm is hers / and plainly the victory
If I rebelled honor none ne glory
I might not in any wise acheue
Sith I am yolden / how should I then preue
To run away / I wot hit will not be
Though I be loos / at large I may not flee
O god of love how sharp is now thyn arowe
How may thou now so cruelly and so narowe
without cause hurt me and wound
And take none head my sorrows to found
But like a bird that flees at her desire
Till suddenly within the pantore
She is caught though late she was at large
A new tempest forcasteth now my barge
Now up now down / with wind it is so blow
So am I possed and almost overthrow
Fordryue in derknes of many sundry wawe
Alas when shall this tempest ouerdrawe
To clear the skies of mine aduersyte
The lode sterre what that I ne may see
Hit is so hyd with clouds that be black
Alas when will this torment ouerslacke
I can not wit / for who is hurt of new
And bledeth inward till he w^xe pale of hue
And has his wound unwarily fresshe and grene
And hit is not known unto the harms kene
Of mighty cupyde that can so hertes daunte
That no man may in his war him vaunte
To get a price but oonly by mekenes
For there ne vayleth strive ne sturdynes
So may I say that with a look am yolde
And have no power to strive though I would
Thus stand I ever betwix life and death
To love and serve while I have breath
In such a place where I dare not plain
Like him that is in torment and in pain
And knows not to whom to discure
For there that I have holy set my cure
I dare not well for dread ne for danger
And for unknowen tellen how the fire
Of loves bronde is kyndled in my breast
Thus am I murdered and slain at lest
So pryuely within my thought
O lady venus whom I have sought
So wysshe me now what me is best to do
That am distraught with my self so
That I ne wot what way for to torn
Sauf by my self soleyn for to morn
Hangyng in balance betwixe hope and dread
without comfort remedy or read
For hope bids pursue and assaye
And agaynward dread answerth nay
And now with hope I am set a lofte
But dread and danger hard and nothing soft
Has overthrow my trust and put a down
Now at my large / now fetred in prysoun
Now in torment / now in souerayn glory
Now in paradyse and now in purgatory
As man dispayred in a double werre
Borne up with hope / and then anon danger
Me draws a back / and says it shall not be
For where as I of mine aduersyte
Am bold some while mercy to require
Then comes despair and begins me to lere
A new lesson to hope full the contrary
They ben so diverse they will do me varye
And thus I stand dismayed in a trance
For when that hope were lykly me tauannce
For dread I tremble and dare one word not speak
And if hit so be / that I not out break
To tell the harms that greuen me so sore
But in my self encrece them more and more
And to be slain fully me delight
when of my death she is no thing to wit
For but if she the constreynt plainly know
How should she ever / on my pains rue
Thus often time with hope I am meuyd
To tell her all / how I am greuyd
And to be hardy on me for to take
To axe mercy / but dread does me then awake
And then wanhope answeryth me again
That better were that she have disdain
To deye attones unknown of any wight
And therewith all bids hope anon right
Me / to be bold and pray her of grace
And sith all virtues be portreyd in her face
Hit were not syttyng / that pity were behind
And right anon within my self I find
A new plee brought on me with dread
That me so maseth that I see no speed
By cause he said that stonyeth all my blood
I am so simple and she is so good
Thus hope and dread in me will not seace
To plete and strive my harms to encrece
But at hardest yet or I be deed
Of my distress sith I can no read
But stand down still as any stone
To fore the goddess I will me haste anon
And complain without more sermon
Though death be fyn and full conclusyon
Of my request / yet I will assaye
And right anon me thought I say
This woeful man as I have memory
Full lowly enter in to an oratorye
And kneled adoun in full humble wise
To fore the goddess and began anon deuyse
His pyteous quarrel with a doleful chere
Saying right thus as ye shall here
The complaynte of the man.
Redress of sorrow O Citherea
That with the stremes of thy plesau^t hete
Gladest the Mount of all Cirrea
where thou have chosen thy paleys and sete
whose bright beams ben wesshen and wete
In the River of Elycon the well
Have now pity of that I shall you tell
And nof disdain ye of your benygnyte
My mortal woo O lady mine Goddess
Of grace and bounte and merciful pity
Benygnely to help and to redress
And though so be I can not well express
The grievous harms that I feel in my heart
Have never yet the less mercy of my smerte
This is to said O clear heuens light
That next the son sercled have your spear
Sith ye me hurt with your dreadful might
By influence of your beams clear
And that I by your seruyse now so dear
As ye me brought in to this maladye
Be ye gracyous and shape ye remedy
For in you holy lies help of all this care
And know best my sorrow and all my pain
For dread of death / how I ne dare alas
To axen mercy ones / ne me complain
Now with your fire heart so constrayne
without more / or I deye at last
That she may wit what is my request
How I no thing in all this world desire
But for to serve fully to mine end
That goodly fresshe so womanly of chere
without change while I have life and mind
And that ye would such grace send
Of my seruyse that she not disdeyne
Sythen her to serve I may not me restreyne
And sith that hope me has give hardynes
To love her best and never to repent
whiles that I live with all my besynes
To dread and serve / though danger never assente
And here upon ye know mine entente
How I have vowed fully in my mind
To be her man / though I no mercy find
For in my heart enprynted is foo sore
Her shap her form and all her semelynes
Her port her chere / her godenes more and more
Her womanhed and the her gentylnes
Her troth / her faith and her kyndnes
with all virtues each set in her degree
There is no lack / saving oonly of pity
Her sad demenyng of will not varyable
Of look benygne / and rote of all plesaunce
And exemplayre to all that will be stable
Discrete prudente of wysdom suffysaunce
Myrrour of wit ground of governance
A world of beauty compassed in her face
whose persant look does through my heart race
And over this wonder secret and true
A well of fredome and right bounteuous
And ever encrecyng in virtue new and new
Of speech goodly / and wonder gracyous
Deuoyde of pride / to pour not dispytous
And if that I shortly shall not feyne
Save upon mercy I no thing complain
what wonder then / though I be with dread
Inly supprysed for to axen grace
Of her that is queen of womanhede
For well I wot in so high a place
Hit will not be / therefore I over pace
And take lowly what woo I endure
Till she of pity me take to her cure
But one auowe plainly here I make
That whether so be / she do me life or deye
I will not grutche / but humbly hit take
And thank god and wylfully obey
For by my troth my heart shall never reneye
For life ne death mercy ne danger
Of will and thought to be at her desire
To ben as true as ever was Antonyus
To Cleopatre while him lasted breath
Or on to Thesbe young Pyramus
That was faithful found / till them depted death
Right so shall I till Antropos me sleeth
For well or woo her faithful man be found
Unto my last / like as my heart is bound.
To love as well as did Achylles
Unto his last the fair Polixene
Or as the great famous Hercules
For dianyre that felt the shot kene
Right so shall I say right as I mean
while that I live / her both dread and serve
For lack of mercy though she do me sterue
Now lady venus to whom no thing unknow
Is in the world hyde / ne naught may be
For there nys thing neither hye ne low
May be counceled from your pryuete
Fro whom my menyng is not now secree
But wit fully that mine intent is true
And like my truth now on my pain rue
For more of grace than of presumpcyon
I axe mercy / and no thing of dute
Of lowly humbles / without offencyon
That ye enclyne of your benygnyte
your audyence unto my humylyte
To grant me that to you I clepe and call
Some day relees yet of my pains all
And sithe ye have the guerdon and the mede
Of all lovers pleynly in your hand
Now of grace and pity take ye head
Of my distres / that am under your bond
So lowly bound / as ye well understand
In that place where I took first my wound
Of pity suffer ye my health may be found
That like as she me hurt with a sight
Right so with health let me her sustene
And as the stremes of her eyes bright
whylom my heart with wounds sharp * kene
Through persed have and yet be fresshe and grene
So as she me hurt / let her me socour
Or else certain I may not long endure
For lack of speech I can say you no more
I have matter but I can not plain
My wit is dull to tell all my sore
A mouth I have / and yet for all my pain
For want of words I may not now attain
To tell half / that does my heart grieve
Mercy abydyng / till she me list releue
But this theffect of my matter fynall
with death or mercy relees for to find
For heart body thought life lust and all
with all my reason and all my full mind
And five wits of one assent I bind
To her seruyse with out any stryf
And make her pryncesse of my death or life
And now I pray of reuth and eke pity
O goodly planet / o lady venus bright
That ye your sone of his deyte
Lupide I mean that with his dreadful might
And with his brond that is so clear of light
Her heart so to fire and to mark
As ye me whylom brent with a spark
That like wise and with the same fire,
She may be hit / as I now brenne and melte
So that her heart be fla^med with desire
That she may know by ferue^ce how I swelte
For of pity plainly if she felt
The self hete that does mine heart enbrace
I hope of reuth she will do me grace
And there with all Venus as me thought
Toward this man full benygnely
Began cast her eye / like as that she rought
Of his disease / and said full goodly
Sith it is so / that thou so humbly
without grutchyng our hestes list obey
Toward thyn help I will anon pourueye
And also my sone Lupide that is so blind
He shall be helpyng fully to perform
your hooll desire / that no thing be behind
Ne shall be left / so we shall reform
This pyteous co^playnt / yt makes y^ to morn
That she for whom you sorowest most in heart
Shall through her mercy relece all thy smert
when she sees time / through our purueau^ce
Be not to hasty / but suffer all thing well
For in abydyng / through lowly obeyssau^ce
Lies full redres / of all that ye now feel
And she shall be as true as any stele
To you alone / by our might and grace
If ye list mekely abide a little space
But understand ye that all her cherisyng
Shall be grounded upon honest
That no wight shall by any rehercyng
Deem amys of her in no degree
For neither mercy / reuth / nor pity
She shall not have ne take of the none head
Ferther than longs unto her womanhede
Be not astonyed of no wylfulnes
Ne not despeyred of this dissolucyon
Let reason bridle lust by buxumnes
without grutchyng or rebellyon
For Joy shall follow all this passion
For who can suffer torment and endure
Ne may not faylle / but follow shall his cure
For to fore all she shall the love best
So shall I her without offencyon
By Influence enspyre in her breast
In honest wise with full entencyon
For tenclyne by clean affection
Her heart fully on the to have reuthe
By cause I know that thou menest treuthe
Goo now to her where as he stant a side
with humble chere / and put the in her grace
And all before let hope be thy guide
And though that dread would with the pace
Hit sytteth well / but look that thou arace
Out of thyn heart wanhope and dispeyr
To her presence er thou have repeyr
And mercy first shall thy way make
And honest menyng before do thy message
To make pity in her heart awake
And secretnes to further thy vyage
with humble port to her that is so sage
Shall means be / and I my self also
Shall the fortune / or thy tale be do
Goo forth anon / and be right good of chere
For specheles no thing may you speed
Be good of trust and be no thing in were
Sith I my self shall helpen in this need
For at lest of her goodlyhede
She shall to the her audyence enclyne
And lowly to her till thou thy tale fine
For well thou wost if I shall not feyne
without speech thou may no mercy have
For who that will of his pryue pain
Fully be cured his life to help and save
He must mekely out of his heart grave
Discure his wound and show hit his leche
Or else deye for defaute of speech
For he that is in mischyef reklees
To seche help I hold him a wretch
And she ne may thyn heart bring in pees
But if thy compleynt to her heart stretche
would thou be cured and wylt no salve fetch
Hit will not be / for no wight may atteyne
To come to bliss / if he list live in pain
Therefore attones goo forth in humble wise
To fore thy lady and lowly knele a down
And in all truth thy words so deuyse
That she on the have compassyon
For she that is of so hye renoun
In all virtues as queen and souerayn
Of womanhede shall rue on thy pain
And when the gods this lesson had told
About me so I began behold
Right so astonyed stood in a trance
To see the manner and countenance
And all the chere of this woeful man
That was of hue dedely pale and wan
with dread supprysed in his own thought
Making chere as though he rought naught
Of life ne death ne what so him betyde
So much fere he had on every side
To put him forth for to tell his pain
Unto his lady / other to complain
what woo he felt torment or disese
what dedely sorrow his heart did sese
For reuthe of which his wooes I endyte
My pen I feel quake as I write
Of him I had so great compassyon
For to reherce his weymentacyon
That uneath though with my self I strive
I want connyng his pains to discryue
^las to whom shall I for help call
Not to the muses for cause they ben all
Help of right in Joy and not in woo
And in matters that they delight also
wherefore they nyll as now dyrecte my style
Nor me enspyre alas the hard while
I can no further but to Thesiphon
And to her suster to call help upon
That be goddesses of torment and pain
Now let your teres in to mine ynke reyne
with woofull words my paper for to blotte
This woofull matter to peynt not / but spotte
To tell the manner of this dredefull man
Upon his complaynt when he first began
To tell his lady when he began declare
His hyd sorrows / and his enyll fare
That at his heart constreyned so sore
Theffect of which was this without more
Pryncesse of youth and flour of gentylnes
Ensample of virtue ground of curtesye
Of beauty rote queen and eke maystres
To all wym^en how they shall hem gye
And sothfast myrrour texemplyfye
The right way of port and of womanhede
what I shall say / of mercy take ye head
Besechyng first unto your hye nobles
with quakyng heart of my Inward dread
Of grace and pity and not of rightwysnes
Of very reuthe to helpen this need
This is to say O well of goodlyhede
That I ne recke though ye do me deye
So ye list first to here what I seye
The dredefull stroke the great force and might
Of god Cupide that no man may rebel
So Inwardly through out mine heart right
I perced has that I ne may councele
Mine hyd wound ne I ne may apele
Unto no gretter / this mighty god so fast
you to serve has me bound unto my last
That heart and all without stryf ar yolde
For life or death to your seruyse alone
Right as the goddess mighty Venus would
Tofore her mekely when I made my moan
She me constreyned without change anon
To your seruyse and never for to feign
wherso ever ye list to do me ease or pain
So that I can no thing but mercy cry
Of you my lady / and change for no new
That ye list goodly tofore or that I deye
Of very reuthe upon my pains rue
For by my truth / and ye my pains knew
what is the cause of mine aduersyte
On mine dysese ye would have pity
For unto you true and eke secree
I will be found to serve as I best can
And therewith all as lowly in each degree
To you be alone as ever yet was man
Unto his lady from the time I began
And shall so forth withouten any sloth
whiles that I live / by god and by my troth
For lever I had to deye suddenly
Than you offend in any manner wise
And suffer pains inward pryuely
Than my seruyse as now ye should dispyse
For I right naught will axe in no wise
But for your servant ye would me accept
And when I trespace / goodly me correct
And for to grant of mercy the prayer
Oonly of grace and womanly pyce
From day to day that I might lere
You for to plese / and therewith all that ye
When I do mys / list for to teache me
In your seruyse how that I may amend
From hensforth and never you offend
For unto me hit does enough suffyse
That for your man ye would me resceyue
Fully to be as ye list deuyse
And as ferforth as my wits can conceive
And therewith all like as ye preue
That I be true / to guerdone me of grace
Or else to punysshe after my trespace
And if so be that I may not atteyne
Unto your mercy / yet grant at lest
In your seruyse for all my woo and pain
That I may deyen after my beheste
This is all and some the fyn of my request
Either with mercy your servant to save
Or mercyles that I may be begraue
And when this benygne of her intent true
Conceived has the complaynt of this man
Right as the fresshe rody Rose new
Of her color to wexen she began
Her blood astonyed so from her heart it ran
In to her face of very femynyte
Through honest dread abashed was she
And humbly she began her eyes cast
Toward him of her benygnyte
So that no word by her lyppes paste
For have nor dread mercy ne pity
For so demened she was in honest
That vnduysed no chyng fro her stert
So much of reason was compassed in heart
Till at last of which she did abrayd
When she his truth and menyng did feel
And unto him full goodly spoke and said
Of your behest and your menyng well
And your seruyse so faithful every dele
Which unto me so lowly now ye offer
With all my heart / I thank you of your profer
That for so much your intent is set
Oonly in virtue I brydled under dread
Ye must of right nedis fare the bet
Of your request / and the better speed
But as for me I may of womanhede
No ferther grant to you in mine entente
Than as my lady Venus will assente
For she well knows I am not at my large
To done right naught but by her ordinance
So am I drowned under her dredefull charge
Her list tobbeye without varyaunce
But for my part so hit be plesaunce
Unto the goddess for troth in your empryse
I you accept fully to my seruyse
For she my heart has in subieccyon
Which holy is yours and never shall repent
In thought nor deed in mine eleccyon
Wytnes on Venus that knows mine intent
Fully tobeye her dome and Judgment
So as her list dispose and ordeyne
Right as she knows ye trought of us tweyne
For unto the time that Venus list provide
To shape away for our hertes ease
Both ye and I mekely must abide
To take at gree / and not of our disease
To grutche again till that she list tappease
Our hyd woo so July that constreyneth
From day to day and our hertes peyneth
For in abydyng of woo and all affraye
Who so can suffer is founden remedy
And for the best full often is made delay
Er men beheled of their maladye
Wherefore as Venus list this matter to gye
Let us agree / and take all for the best
Till her list / set both our hertes in rest
For she is that byndeth and can constreyn
Hertes in one / this fortunate planete
And can releace lovers of her pain
To turn fully her bitter in to sweet
Now blysfull gods down fro thy sterry sete
Us to fortune cast your stremes shene
Like as ye know / that we troth mean
And therewith all as I mine eyes cast
For to perceive the manner of these tweyne
Tofore the goddess mekely as they paste
Me thought I saw with a golden cheyne
Venus / anon enbrace and constreyne
Her both hertes in one / for to persevere
Whiles that they live / and never to disseuere
Seyeng right thus with a benygne chere
Sith it is so / ye be under my might
My will is thus / that ye my daughter dear
Full accept this man as it is right
Unto your grace anon here in my sight
That ever has been so lowly you to serve
Hit is good skyll your thank that he deserve
your honor sauf and also your womanhede
Him to cherysshe / hit sytteth you right well
Sych he is bound under hope and dread
Amyd my cheyne that forged is of stele
ye must of mercy shape that he feel
In you some grace of his long seruyse
And that in have like as I shall deuyse
This is to say that ye take heed
How he to you often faithful it and true
Of all your servants / and no thing for his mede
Of you ne asks / but ye on him rue
For he vowed has to change for no new
For life ne death / for Joy ne for pain
Ay to be yours / so as ye list ordain
wherefore ye must or else it were wrong
Unto your grace fully him receive
In my presence / by cause he has so long
Holy ben yours / as ye may conceive
That from your mercy / if ye him weyue
I will my self record cruelte
In your person / and great lack of pity
Let him for his troth find then again
For long seruyse / guerdon him with grace
And late your pity weye down his pain
For time is now danger to arace
Out of your heart / and mercy in to space
And love for love would well beseme
To give again and this I plainly deem
And as for him I will be his borowe
Of lowlyhede and besy attendaunce
How he shall be both eve and morrow
Full dilygent to done his obseruaunce
And ever awaytyng / you to do pleysaunce
wherefore my sone / lysten and take heed
Fully tobeye / as I shall the read
And first of all my will is that thou be
Faithful in heart and constant as a wall
True humble / meke / and therewith all secre
without change in party or in all
And for no torment that the fallen shall
Tempest the not / but ever in stedfastnes
Rote thyn heart / and void doublenes
And ferthermore have in reverence
These wm^yen all for thy lady sake
And suffer never that men hem do offense
For love of one / but evermore undertake
Hem to defend whether they sleep or wake
And ay be ready to holden them party
Against all tho that to hem have envy
Be curtees ay and lowly of thy speech
To rich and pour ay fresshe and well beseyn
And ever besy ways for to seche
All true lovers to release of her pain
Sith you art one / and of no wight have disdayn
For love has power hertes for to daunte
And never for cherysyng / the tomoche auaunt
Be lusty eke void of all trystesse
And take no thought but ever be Iocound
And not to pensyf for none heaviness
And with thy gladness / let sadness ay be found
wha^ woo approaches / let myrthe most habou^d
As manhod axeth / and though you feel smert
Let not to many know of thyn heart
And all virtues besely thou sue
Vices eschew for the love of one
And for no tales thyn heart not renew
word is but wynd that shall soon ouergoon
what ever thou here be dombe as any stoon
And to answer to soon / not the delight
For here she stands yt all this shall the quyte
And whether thou be absent or in presence
None others beawte let in thy heart mine
Sith I have give her of beauty excellence
Above all other in virtue for to shine
And think how in fire me^ arn wont to fine
This pured gold to put hit in assaye
So to the prove / thou art put in delay
But time shall come thou shall for thy suffrau^ce
Be well apayd and take for thy mede
Thy lives Joy and all thy suffysau^ce
So that good hope always thy brydell led
Let no dispeyr hyndre the with dread
But ay thy trust upon her mercy ground
Sith none but she may thy sorrow sound
Each hour and time / weke / day / and year
Be like faithful and vary not for lyte
Abide a while and then of thy desire
The time neygheth that shall the most delight
And let no sorrow in thy heart byte
For no differryng / sith thou for thy mede
Shall rejoice in pees the flour of womanhede
Think how she is this worldis son and light
The sterre of beauty the flower eke of fayrnes
Both crop^ and rote and eke the rubye bright
Hertes to glade / ytroubled with derknes
And how I have made her. thyn hertes empress
Be glad therefore to be under her bond
Now come nere daughter and take him by the *hand
Unto this fyn that after all these shours
Of his torment he may be glad and light
when by your grace ye take him to be yours
For evermore anon here in my sight
And eke I will also as hit is right
without more his langour for to lysse
In my presence anon that ye him kiss
That there may be of all your old smertes
A full relees under Joy assured
And that one lock be of your both hertes
Shet with my ^eye of gold so well pured
Oonly in sign that ye have recured
your hooll desire here in this holy place
within my temple now in the year of grace
Eternally be bound of assurance
The knot is knyt / that may not be unbound
That all the gods of this allyau^ce
Saturn / Jove / and Mars as it is found
And eke Cupide that first did you wound
Shall bear record / and evermore be wreke
On which of you / his troth first break
So that by aspectes of their fyry lokes
without mercy shall fall the vengeance
For te be raced clean out of my books
On which of you be found of varyau^ce
Therefore attones sets your plesau^ce
Fully to be while ye have life and mind
Of one accord unto your lives end
That if the spirit of newfanglenes
In any wise your hertes would assaylle
To meue or styre to bring in doublenes
Upon your troth to give a bataylle
Let not your courage ne your force faylle
Nor none assaults you flytten or remeue
For unassayed no man may troth preue
For white is whytter if it be set by black
And sweet is swetter after bytternes
And falshed ever is driven and put abacke
where truth is roted without doublenes
without prove there may be no sekernes
Of love or hate and therefore of you two
Shall love be more / for hit was bought with woo
And every thing is had more in deute
And more of price when it is dear bought
And eke love stondeth more in seurte
when it is tofore with pain woo and thought
Conquered was first when hit was sought
And every conquest has his excellence
In his poursute as it fyndeth resystence
And so to you more sote and agreeable
Shall love be found I do you plainly assure
without grutchyng that ye were suffrable
So low so meke pacyently to endure
That all attones I shall do now my cure
For now and ever your hertes so to bind
That naught but death shall the knot unbind
Now in this matter what should I longer dwell
Come ye attones and do as I have said
And first my daughter that are of bou^te well
In heart and thought be glad and well apayd
To do him grace that shall and has obeyed
your lusts ever / and I will for his sake
Of troth to you be bound and undertake
And so forth within presence as they stand
Tofore the gods this fair and well
Her humble servant took goodly by the hond
As he tofore her*mekely did knele
And kyssed him after fulfyllyng every dele
from point to point in full thryfty wise
As ye to forn had Venus herd deuyse
Thus is this man to Joy and all plesau^ce
From heaviness and from his pains old
Full reconcyled / and has full snffysau^ce
Of her that ever meant well / and would
That in good faith and I tell should
The Inward myrthes did her hertes brace
For all my life to tell / it were to little space
For he has won her that he loves best
And she to grace has take him of pity
And thus her hertes ben both set in rest
without change or mutabilyte
And Venus has of her benygnyte
Confermed all what shall I longer tarry
These tweyne in one and never to vary
That for the Joy in the temple about
Of this acorde by great solempnyte
was laud and honor within and without
Give to Venus / and to the deyte
Of god Cupide / so that Caliope
And all her sustren in her Armonye
Sweet with their so^ges ye goddds to magnifye
And all attones with notes loud and sharp
They did her honor and her reverence
And Orpheus among them with his harp
Began strings touch with his dilygence
And Amphion that has such excellence
Of musyke ay did his business
To plese and queme Venus the goddess
Oonly for cause of the affynyte
Betwix these two not lusty to disseuere
And every lover of low and hye degree
Began Venus pray frothens forth and ever
That hooll of them the love may persevere
withouten end in such wise as they gonne
And more encrece that hit of hard was won
And the gods heryng this request
As she that knew the clean entencyon
Of both them tweyne made a byhest
Perpetuelly by confyrmacyon
whiles they live of one affection
They shall endure there is no more to said
That neither shall have matter to complain
So ferforth evermore in our eternal see
The gods have in our presence
Fully devised through their deyte
And holy concluded by her Influence
That by their might and Just prudence
The love of hem by grace and eke fortune
without change shall evermore contune
Of which grant the Temple enuyron
Through hye comfort of them yt were present
Anon was goon with a melodyous sown^
In name of tho that troth in love meant
A balade new in full good intent
Tofore the gods with notes loud and clear
Syngyng right this anon as ye shall here
Fairest of sterres that with your persau^t light
And with the cherysyng of your stremes clear
Causen in love hertes to be light
Oonly by shynyng of your glad spear
Now lawde and price O Venus lady dear

To you we thank lovers that been here
That ye this man and never for to twynne
Fortuned have his lady for to win
And with the noise and heavenly melodye
with that they made in her armonye
Through out the temple for this man's sake
Out of my sleep anon I did awake
And for astonyed knew as tho no read
For sodeyn change oppressed with dread
My thought was cast in a trance
So clean away was tho my remembrance
Of all my dreme / whereof great thought and woo
I had in heart and nyst what was to do
For heaviness for that I had lost the sight
Of her that I all the long night
Had dremed of in mine aduysyon
whereof I made great lamentacyon
By cause I had never in mine life beforn
Saw none so fair sith that I was born
For love of whom so as I can endyte
I purpose here to make and write
A little treatise and process make
In price of wym^en oonly for her sake
Hem to comende as it is skyll and right
For her goodness with all my might
Prayeng to her that is so bounteuous
So full of virtue and so gracyous
Of womanhede and merciful pity

Till I have leyzer unto her hye renoun
For to expowne my foresaid vysyoun
And tell in plain the signefyaunce
As it comes to my remembrance
So that here after my lady may hit look
Now goo thy way thou little rude book
To her presence as I the comau^de
And first of all thou me recomau^de
Unto her and to her excellence
