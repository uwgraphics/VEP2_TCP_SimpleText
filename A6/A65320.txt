WATTEN Towns-end; Or, A Nosegay of Pleasure, Which grew in the Garden of VENUS.
Tune is, Watten Towns end; Or, Lame Leg next the Wall,




AS I come up by Arpendeen
and straight to Watten Town,
And there I met a pretty wench,
that looked like Lay me down;
At Watten Towns end, at Watten Towns end
At every Door, there stands a Whore,
at Watten Towns end.
The Frigat's Name was Thunderbolt,
her Sails were all of Silk;
Her Cacklen was of Silver twist,
her Color like the Milk.
At Watten Towns end, etc.
Her Planks were all of Ivory,
her Bottom beaten-Gold:
Her Deck was Alablaster pure,
she looked brisk and bold.
At Watten Towns end, at Watten towns end
At every Door, there stands a Whore,
at Watten Towns end.


HEr Head was gilded over and over,
her Wanton Flag did fly:
And I was mad to be on Board,
so much a Fool was I
At Watten towns end, at Watten towns end
At every Door, there stands a Whore,
at Watten towns end.
She seemed a stately Pleasure-Boat,
with tempting good attire:
But little knew that (under Deck)
her Gun-Room was in Fire.
At Watten towns end.
I lodged with her, I laid her down,
I slept with her all night:
I supped upon a Coney-Fatt,
whose Gravey was delight
At Watten towns end, etc.
She gave to me a Syrrup sweet,
was in her Placket-Box;
But e're three Minutes went about,
it proved the French Pox.
At Watten towns end, etc.
This Fire-Ship she did blow me up,
as my Effigies shows,
And all may read upon my Face
The loss of Teeth and Nose,
At Watten towns end, etc.
Now as I walk along the streets,
they gaze upon my face,
And every one that looks at me,
salutes me with disgrace
At Watten towns end, etc.
By me beware then Gentlemen,
From King in Country Clown,
And when you see a pretty Wench,
Remember Lay me down.
At Watten towns end, at Watten towns end,
At every door, there stands a Whore,
at Watten towns end.
FINIS.
