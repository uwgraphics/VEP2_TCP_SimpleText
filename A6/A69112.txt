(...).
PAideutico -- Grammatice, or the right way to instruct Youth in Grammar: that
is, the Hebrew, Greek, Latin, or any other, is by Analysis and Genesis.
Analysis is a resolving or undoing of the matter of Grammar, wisely fitted to
the understanding and capacity of the learners. Here we are specially to take
heed, that nothing be passed over, either not sufficiently made plain by the
Teacher, or not well understood by the Learner: then which evil, nothing is
more pernicious in a School. And Analysis, is either of the precepts of the
art it self, or the examples.

The Analysis of the precepts is, of the definitions, divisions, proprieties,
and transitions, from which only all the knowledge of the Art is perfected.
But there is a particular and peculiar exposition of every precept, whence the
right understanding thereof is gotten. And it is Etymologicall or Syntacticall.
Etymologicall is the explaining of the whole matter of Etymology, in Letters,
Syllables, and single-words. Where together with the Adsignifications of words,
their significations also, both proper and borrowed, offer themselves necessary
to be explained. Hither likewise belong the Idiomes and proprieties of
tongues, the observation whereof cannot without great loss of learning be
passed over. Syntacticall is a manifest explaining of the matter belonging to
Syntax, in sentences, and the parts thereof. Here the express signification of
words, the elegancies of phrases, the propriety of speech, the apt placing of
words, the natural habit of the language, and the whole disposing and framing
of all things is to be observed. Thus much of the Analysis of Precepts.

The Analysis of examples follows, which are indeed most aptly framed after the
exact rule of the precepts. But the Analysis of the example, is a skillful
applying of the example to the precept. Whence it comes to pass, that the
very precepts do more clearly appear in the understandings of the learners,
and are more surely kept in their memory. And this is briefer, or longer. The
briefer is that which explaines those examples, which immediately are applied
to make clear and demonstrate the precepts of Art.

The resolving of these is so far to be made, as makes for the
understanding of that precept, whereof it is an example. But the longer is that
which explaines the longer examples and treatises of Orators, Historians,
Poets, and others whatsoever. The use and daily practice of this, makes ready
and perfect Grammarians, and that in a short time: especially if the Master,
wisely and after good deliberation resolving upon: first a certainty of
Authors, exercises, and progress for every several form: secondly, one set
task, or exercise for every several hour, which in no wise shall exceed the
compass thereof: thirdly, that one hours Lecture requires the practice of
six hours at the least, for the applying of the same unto all manner of use,
for writing and speaking: fourthly, a constancy for using and observing the
same from week to week, from month to month, and so forth: If the Master, I
say, has out of the artificial measure and number, and the elegantly-composed
order of such classical Authors, whereof there is in the whole life of man,
good and continual use, construed: that is, verbally translated, and with good
judgment fitted, every word and phrase thereof to the Learners capacity, out
of Latin into English alone, and out of Hebrew or Greek into English or
Latin alone: for there is one reason of all. First, by setting each thing in
his Grammatical and natural order: that is, all such words as do govern and
are declared by others, in the former places, and such as be governed, or do
declare, necessarily depending on the former, in the places next following: and
withal sufficiently instructing and informing his Scholars in the reasons of
this his placing of them according to Grammar. Secondly, by giving them their
proper and natural significations, so far forth as sense, and the propriety
of the English phrase will in any wise permit: If otherwise, by reason of some
trope, unusual phrase, or harder sentence, let him set v. in the margent,
Whatsoever is so expressed in the Text, is not to be construed with the rest of
the Text.
or in a different letter in the Text, to show, that adverbum, it is otherwise:
i. for id est, to explain the sense, and so forth. Which being used by the
Scholars accordingly, has the effects and benefits following.

Benefits of verbal Translations to the Scholars.
FIrst, they may by their often reading their new Lecture, thus verbally by
their Master translated into English alone, easily conceive, truly understand,
and well remember the general drift and scope of their Author for their
present Lecture: and can, after they have been a little practiced therein, and
accustomed to it, make convenient report thereof, before they come to construe
it. Which thing if they endeavor to do with proper words, fit sentences, good
grace and constantly, is a matter of great worth and strange consequence.
Further, the understanding and knowing of the matter being the beginning and
fountain of writing elegantly, speaking readily, and to the point, the rest:
whether words or phrases with their significations or uses of them, will far
more easily follow, and be much the sooner learned. And this is the ready
entrance to the Analysis by verbal translations.

Secondly, boys alone, or a form by it self, the argument and matter being
first well known, can by using verbal translations, take new Lectures,
construing first out of the English into Latin, and back again out of the
Latin into English. Which indeed, being truly considered, is nothing else
but a continual making of Latin, as out of the Masters Dictates, or an
answering in Latin, to one that in leading them by the hand, goes from point
to point, before them in English. In which taking of lectures by themselves,
as, first they are rightly directed, and certainly guided, to give every word
his true force, every phrase his right sense, and every thing his own place:
So secondly, for the preventing of coffeehouse to their Master by
forgetfulness, and the better imprinting of all things in their minds, they
may, without ever failing, be more constantly instructed, then by the lively
voice of the Master alone, which may be hindered by forgetfulness, some
employment, interruption, weariness, absence, sickness, age, and so forth:
And which notwithstanding: he may, if the obscure and hidden sense of the
Author require, use at his pleasure, whereas on the other side, verbal
translations, subject to none of these, are continually ready, and at hand,
preventing all loss of time and labor.

Thirdly, if the Scholars do so well understand, and truly know the
paradeigmata of Nounes and Verbes, and the most usual examples of Syntax, that
they be able to parallel, that is, to show what case of Noune person of Verb,
or example of Syntax, every word in their Lecture is like (for till that time
no man of judgment in this kind, will think the Scholars fit to go any
further,) and also finding the words in their Grammatical and natural order
as they were construed, may now easily, for to gain time, alone, and by
themselves parse and examine their Lecture without further help, or asking, or
being asked any question, and that without error, rendering a reason why every
word is so as it is, and not otherwise: that is to say, why a word is the
singular number, and not the plural, and the contrary: why the Nominative
case, and not the Genitive: why the Present tense, and not the Future, or any
else: and so for any other like circumstance of Etymology or Syntax. All this
the Scholars may do, as out of their Lecture, as it lies in their Author, or
else as it is daily (for that end) written in their paper book in the
Grammatical and natural order in Latin alone: so also much better, and far
more profitably out of the verbal translations in English-alone.

Fourthly, verbal translations are a very notable means, as in men, for the
recovering of knowledge decayed, and the increase and growth thereof in such as
are but entered into the tongue: so also in children for the keeping in mind of
things before learned: for by help hereof, they may by a daily and continual
repeating every one his section or part, out of English into Latin, and back
again out of Latin into English, in a short time go over, and so easily keep
long treatises, that were once well known, perfectly understood, and the
repetition thereof not long intermitted. The same also may be said for the
keeping of Dictates that have been carefully corrected by their Master,
whether in the form of Colloquies, Epistles, Theames, and so forth. And in
case they do again and again forget, (as children often do) they may hereby
easily refresh their memory at their pleasure. Doubtless hereby they shall
attain to so perfect, and absolute a knowledge in all things learned, and
circumstances thereof, that for the same, and the like of that nature and
kind, they will be so prompt and ready, that they shall never afterward need,
for the words and phrases Lexicon or Dictionary* or for the matter, instructor,
or teacher: because all things thus learned, iterated, exercised, yea imprinted
and engraven in them, will stick so fast in their memory, that they will be
able, as out of a rich storehouse (fully fraught with wares of great worth and
price) perpetually to bring forth their own stuff, old and new, choice and
good, and that more surely for all uses of writing and speaking suddenly or
otherwise, then by the ordinary means of learning the most Authors without
book. Which practice notwithstanding for the increase and maintaining of
memory, that without daily exercise decays, is very necessary. And then only
without tediousness, may Lectures and Treatises be committed to memory, when
they have been by often reading, construing, parsing, making manifold use and
great practice thereof, thoroughly known, and perfectly understood. Therefore
all such precious and unrecouerable time as has been ill, or to no great
purpose usually spent, Centies agendo centies actum, an hundred times going
over that that had been already an hundred times done, may by the wise Master
be wholly gained, and kept as an unknown treasure, to be better and more
wisely employed in all the practices of memory for the retaining of all things
before learned.

Fifthly, verbal translations help very much to attain a variety and copy of
words and phrases, and in time to a laudable propriety, and purity of writing
and speaking the English tongue, the very maine end, why more then nine ten
parts of children be set to School. Which seeing it is our natural tongue,
and in any course of life afterward altogether in use, ought much more then it
is, to be Grammatically known, and after the course here set down for the
Latin, parsed and examined, and in all School exercises (after Tullies
example, who as well in matters of Oratory, as Philosophy, Cum Graecis Latina
coniunxit) daily practiced: yea the Idiomes, proprieties, and elegancies,
peculiar to this tongue, are as much, and as constantly by the Master to be
showed, taught, inculcated, exercised and learned, as the Latinismes,
Grecismes, Hebraismes, and so forth. Thus much of the benefits to the Scholars.

Benefits of Verbal Translations to the Master.
FIrst, he having once advisedly written the verbal Translations in English
alone, is for ever afterward freed from iterating the same, neither shall he
need, or any for him, any more to interpret and construe those Authors so
verbally translated.

Secondly, what occasions soever do befall him of absence, or other lets and
interruptions, his Scholars enured to the manner of verbal Translations, have
a sure and never-failing guide for their daily and sufficient proceeding.

Thirdly, he shall not need to be troubled with telling, and many times telling
what is forgotten, or doubted of, or so much vexed with his scholars dullness
and untowardnesse, as before, seeing they by these verbal Translations can of
themselves learn their Lectures, and forgetting any thing therein, may
herewith also refresh their memoryes, and by taking pains, make themselves
prompt and ready in all circumstances thereof.

Fourthly, the Master being hereby freed from that* that is the least part of
his Office, the toil of exact reading of Lectures to his Scholars, assured
also that in his very absence, they do hereby make sufficient progress, may
in his daily taking account and examining every Lecture, by hearing, exhorting,
correcting, and every way exercising them, and by all his words, deeds,
examples, wisely ordering, and discreetly guiding them, which be the chiefest
points of his function: (for men are made exquisitely skillful in Tongues, and
Arts by example, imitation, diligence and custom, much better then by
precepts) he, I say, may bestow the greater pains: first, upon all such words
and phrases as be specially to be observed and noted, for extraordinary use,
excellency, or unusual difficulty, as being some strange Anomaly in Latin, or
some phrase much differing from the vulgar tongue, Secondly, with a purpose to
leave nothing therein (that concerns the^ any way to know) unsearched out,
familiarly, plainly, and from point to point (as the proverb says) going
before them, in propounding questions of the matter of their Lecture, that even
therein also, for the increase and growth of their judgment, they may be
familiarly acquainted, and surely grounded, using the very words and phrases
thereof in English and Latin together, and the Scholar answer likewise; then
in Latin alone. Which exercise if he once a day constantly practice, in
teaching them as well the words, phrases, sentences, and so forth, as the
matter of any new Lecture, or short sentence unlearned, or unheard of before,
without the help of any book, or so much as once telling them any thing,
except when he can by no circumstance bolt it out, or find it in them, for
making both the tongue and the matter their own, is a notable instrument, for
remembrance leaves a most deep impression, and for any consequence of
Schoole-learning has very admirable effects.

Fifthly, his great labor of moving, iterating, and many times iterating
questions in parsing, may be, by this means also after some reasonable
practice, if not utterly removed, yet much eased: for even young Scholars, may
by, and among themselves, with some reasonable over-looking and directing,
perform it to very good purpose. Thus much of the fourth and last Grammatical
Analysis.

Genesis is the making of a Grammar exercise handsomely and wormanlike
fashioned to the rule of the precepts. And it is either an imitation of some
approved author, or the invention of the maker. An imitation is a Genesis, made
after the examples of the best Authors, as of Cicero, Caesar, Livy, Virgill,
Ovid, Horace, Terence, and so forth. Here four observations are most
necessary: First, that the Master dictate and go before his Scholars in every
Genesis, until they be competently able to make them alone and by themselves,
alwais over every unknown word or phrase in English, writing the proper word
or phrase in Latin. The second, that every Genesis be made in the very steps
of the Grammatical Analysis. The third, that as in every new Genesis there be
a continual practicing of some words formerly learned, so also that they make
greatest practice, and most uses of the obscurest things, and spend their
chiefest pains upon those elegant phrases and sentences, (...)
which differ most from (...). The fourth, that the (...) by tongue and (...)
any (...), sentence, the matter (...), Epistle, and so forth. The first
imitation is of the word governing, and the word governed alone, with any least
alteration of number case, gender, tense, or person. The second imitation is of
them which we commonly call Phrases and f^rmulae loquenai: and also of a whole
sentence of two, or more clauses, by changing therein one, two, or more words.
The third imit^tion, when the two former have been* by continual and long
practice the very (...), and never deceiving guide to all good learning, made
easy and familiar: is (...) about the help of their author (...), wherein
their Lectures be written, in the Grammatical and natural order in Latin
alone, or else out of their verbal translations in English, again to frame ^n
measure and number the Latin, as every word had been before artificially
composed, and cunningly placed in their Author* yea and to make every word and
phrase in their Dictates suitable, and every way answerable to the same elegant
composed style. Which Genesis if it be from verbal translations of Poets, (and
that they understand the quantities of syllables, with the reason of feet and
verses) makes the entrance into versifying most ready and pleasant: and with
manifold use of Parodiae and imitation of verses, it also makes the vein and
phrases of Poets easy and familiar. In these several sorts of Genesis, even
the young Scholar may be bold and confident, that his Latin is right, good
and pure, the order of words, elegant, neat, and sweet: Lastly, his verse true,
plain and easy, having his author to avouch and warrant the same, as the
examining and trying of all will show plainly, and prove directly. The fourth
and last imitation when they be as familiarly acquainted with, and as well able
to practice this third, as the two former, is to go forward with some well and
cunningly composed Genesis, whether in a Colloquy, Epistle, or other usual
Schoole-exercise, wherein is required more discretion and choice, then in the
former. This is chiefly made by changing the purpose of the Author, and his
course of speech: so that it may seem to be their own invention, rather then
the imitation of another. It is either addition, which thereunto applies some
thing divised by themselves, or borrowed elsewhere: or else detraction, whereby
those things are cut away which most bewray their imitation, or serve not so
fitly to their present purpose. Which thing is here especially to be remembered,
lest they should seem to have learned the art of stealing, rather then the
skill of writing and speaking. I will not here meddle with (seeing it requires
more both maturity of wit, and soundness of judgment, then is usually to be
found in Grammar Scholars) that last Genesis, which very notably painting out
the Summum bonum of the Art it self, as being indeed the very mark whereat
we aim, and the true perfection of all professions in learning, is the
devisers mere invention. Then which nothing in the common course of man's life
is more commendable, nothing to Church and Commonwealth more profitable.
Genesis has been thus far.

By these and the like means the Master that is careful to do good by all
means possible in his place, and willing to uphold his authority, by joining
wise and grave severity with kind and loving fear, will bend all his endevors,
to make the school by all good policy an house of play and pleasure. And
because Fax mentis honestae gloria, praise is a great inflamer of an honest
disposition, and the best whetstone to set an edge upon a dull wit, he will
strive: first, by all the means of cheerfulness, in countenance, words,
gestures, and deeds to put life and spirit into the very wit of his Scholars,
for their better conceiving: into their memory, for retaining: into their will,
for laboring: into their disposition, for the attaining of piety, virtue,
knowledge, and all goodness.

Secondly, by sowing amongst them matter of all honest contention, and laudable
emulation, and provoking them every way, day by day, to excel one another by
talking together, as in Corderius: by disputing one against another, as in
Stock-wood: by writing one to another, as imitating one and the same Epistle of
Tully: by representing the persons of others, in pronouncing and acting some
Scene in Terence: by giving the sum or argument of a Treatise, Epistle,
Oration, Poem, Story, and so forth: by reporting some fable of Aesope: by
writing the Roman and Secretary hands: by striving who can find most errors
in each others exercises, and the like. O then how eagerly will they strive,
who shall perform the matter propounded and prescribed, with greatest
commendations, profit most, and prove best learned. The pregnant and quicker
sort will strive to supply the first ranks; and the dull and heavy
disposition, at least desiring, if no way to be equal with, to second, or come
near the best, yet certainly to point and aim at the worthiest. Of so great
worth is a wise and discreet Master, that of all them that come under his
tuition, and charge, the natural fool only is finally found incapable of his
discipline. All the Master his endeavors shall be the more effectual, if
parents and friends at home (wisely preventing all odious telling tales out of
the School) would by propounding to their children if they profit in
learning, and deserve well, rewards: but if if all, punishment: constantly and
with good descretion, exact at their hands a reason, and an account of their
daily and whole employment in the School. For discipline at School alone
moves somewhat: but at home and School too, promoteth learning greatly. This
would, in stead of causing boys by any bitter discouragement of words, or
otherwise, to distaste and abhor the School, before they know, or can be
acquainted with the sweetness of knowledge: make them to be greatly enflamed
with the desire and love of learning, which as it is of it self sweet and
pleasant: so it is naturally inbred in all men, though by perverse proceeding,
disorderly courses, and uneasy means of teaching it be made unpleasant,
tedious, and so, for the most part, be neglected, yea rejected and contemned,
as a thing utterly fruitless and un-necessary.

All things then being well considered, children may by these courses, upon
surer ground, with better courage, more ease, greter pleasure, much more
constantly, and in far shorter time, then usually heretofore, attain unto more
sound schoole-learning, keep it more faithfully in memory, and make more true
use of it, to the great content of their parents, and friends, their own
benefits in the whole course of their life, the advanceme^t of learning and
all good Arts, the singular good of Church and Commonwealth, and their Masters
great joy, and much encouragement, when he may in the singleness of his heart,
a good conscience, and unspeakeable comfort cheerfully go on in this his
calling, though painful, and little esteemed, yet most necessary, and
profitable, knowing assuredly, that with the Lord whom he serves, his reward
is laid up in heaven.

I entreat you

For

although

I be both certified

concerning the rumors

of ye common wealth,

writes

unto me

touching his good will

a letter

I will acquaint you therewith

a little before.

Although

he had met me

in the Hen-wood,

and I had asked him

what you were a doing

said,

that you were

in bed,

because

you were stick of the gout,

I took the matter forsooth heavily,

as

it was my part:

but yet

I determined

to come

unto you,

that

I might both see

you,

and

visit you,

suppe with you too:

I have received

your very short letter,

wherein

I could not

know

that

which

I desired

to understand.

I perceived,

that

ye I doubted not of.

For

I understood not

how well

you bore

the common calamities:

but I easily perceived

how well you loved me,

yet I had had proof of this

v. But I had known this,

if I had known

that:

I would have framed

my letter

thereunto.

But

although

I writ

before

those things which

I thought meet

to be signified unto you

v. to be written,

Yet

I thought

you were to be put in mind

in a word or twain,

v. briefly,

at this time,

that you should not think,

that you were

in any private danger.

We all

are

in great,

but yet

in the common.

Wherefore

you ought not

either

to desire

a private and singular estate,

v. a proper and special fortune,

or

to refuse

the common.

And therefore

let us carry ye mind

one toward

another

v. let us be of that mind between our selves

as we have always done.

I may

hope for

on your part,

on mine own.

with me

that that I thought not of,

the little Oration

for Dejotarus,

which

you desired:

therefore

have I sent

it

I would have you so read it

as

a slender and barren matter.

the writing.

But

I was desirous

to send

a little gift

that chapter,

I said unto him

Cicero S. D. Curioni. 39 2 4
You are not ignorant

that there be

many kinds

of Epistles,

but

this one

is most manifest,

for whose sake

the thing it self

was invented,

that

we should certify

them that be absent

if there were any thing,

which

concerned

either

us

or

them

yt they should know

you do not surely expect

a letter

of this kind

from me:

for you have

both

writers

and

messengers

of your own household matters.

but

there is no news at all

in my matters.

There be

two sorts

of letters

remaining,

which

do very much delight

me:

one

familiar

and

mercy:

the second

sober

and

grave.

I wot not well,

whether of the two

may least beseem

me

to use.

What, should I sport

with you

in a letter?

In very deed,

I think

that he is not

a citizen

which

can

be merry

v. laugh

in these times.

Or

shall I write of

some graver matter?

What is there

which

may

be gravely written on

by Cicero

to Curio,

except it be

of ye commonwealth?

But

this

is

my state

in this kind,

that

I would not willingly

v. I neither would

write

the things which

I do not think.

obseruandum, non scribi and nunc.

Wherefore

seeing

I have

no matter

to write of,

left

unto me,

I will use

that shutting up

which

I am wont:

and I will encourage

you

to the study

of the chiefest commendation,

for an expectation beyond that may be imagined

is appointed

and

prepared

as a grievous adversary

for you,

which

you shall very easily vanquish

by one means,

if

you make this your resolution,

that you must labor earnestly

in those Arts,

v. in those,

whereby

v. by which Arts

those praises

are obtained,

the glory whereof

v. the glo. of which praises

you have exceedingly loved.

I would write

many things

to this purpose,

if I did not verily think

v. unless I did trust

that you were

sufficiently forward

of your own self:

and

I have not done

this

whatsoever

I have lightly touched,

for to prick you forward,

v. for the cause of enflaming you,

but

to testify my good will.

Fare you well.

Cicero. S.D. Bruto. 40 13 14
I am very familiarly acquainted with

Licius Ticius Strabo,

a Gentleman of Rome,

passing honest

and

virtuous.

All the benefits

v, All the right, laws

of most entire acquaintance,

do pass between us.

Publius Cornelius

in your Province

owes

money

to this man.

That matter

is set over

into France

by Volcatius,

who

ministers justice

v. speaks law, decides matters in controversy, ministers justice according to
law,

at Rome.

I crave*

this

of you

in more earnest sort,

then

if

the matter

were

mine own:

as it is a more laudable thing

to take pains

about their friends money,

the^ about their own,

that

you would have a care

his business be dispatched,

your self would undertake it.

go thorough stitch withal

and do what lies in you,

as far as shall seem

just

and

right

unto you:

that

Straboes freeman,

who

is sent

upon this occasion,

may end

the business

upon most equal terms

and obtain the money.

That

shall be

both

most well pleasing

unto me:

and

your self

shall well know

Lucius Ticius

most worthy of

your friendship,

whereof

in most earnest manner

again and again

I do entreat

you,

that

you would have a care,

as

all things

are wont

to be unto you

which

you know

yt I am desirous of.

Fare you well.

Cicero S. D. Fabio. 41 5 18
Although

I

who

desire

to comfort

you,

am

my self

to be comforted,

because

I have taken

nothing

more grievously

this long time,

then

this loss of yours:

yet

not only

do I exhort

you

earnestly,

but also

entreat

and

beseech

for the love between us

to gather heart,

and show your self

a man,

and

bethink your self

in what state

all men are,

and

in what times

we are borne.

Your virtue

has given

more

unto you,

then

fortune

has taken away:

because

you have obtained

that which

many private men have not:

v. m. new or late, m.h. n. or the first of their stocks made honorable,

you have lost

that which

very many most noble men have.

At a word

such a state

of the laws,

judgments,

and times

seems

to be at hand,

v. hang over

that

it may seem

he has sped best,

who

is departed

from this commonwealth

with the easiest damage.

But as for you,

which

have

both

goods

and

children,

and

my self

and others

most straightly lincked

with you

in familiarity

and

good will:

and which

are like to have hereafter

great and easy means

v. g. faculty, opportunity,

to live

with us

and

with all your friends:

v. all yours,

and

seeing

there is

one judgment

of so many,

which

may be found fault withal:

as

which

may be thought

pardoned

by one sentence,

and that

doubtful

of some one man's mightiness.

You ought

to make exceeding light account of

v. to be a* most lightly

this grief

for all these reasons.

My heart,

v. My mind

shall ever be

toward you,

and your children,

such as

v. which

you wish

it should,

and

which

it ought

to be.

Fare you well.

Cicero S. D. Trebatio. 42 6 11
Heretofore

I had only some liking of

Dolabella:

I was

no whit engaged

unto him,

neither in truth fell it out

that I needed him:

yet he was indebted unto me

because

I had not failed him

in his distresses.

At this time,

am I bound

through so great a good turn of his,

because

very abundantly

he has given me

contentment

both

before this

by experience,

v* in a thing

and

at this time

in your safety,

that

I am indebted

more

to no man.

In which business

v. In which thing

so heartily

do I rejoice

on your behalf,

that

I had rather

you should rejoice likewise

on my part,

then

to give me thanks.

At any hand I desire not

the one,

you may

very well

do

the other.

As for that which remains,

because

your virtue

and

honor

has opened you

a way to return

to your friends,

it is a point of wisdom in you,

and noblenes of mind,

to forget

that that you have lost;

to think upon

that yt you have recovered.

You shall live

with your friends,

you shall live

with us;

you have gotten

more honor,

then

you have lost

substance:

which very thing yet

should delight you more,

v. sh. be more pleasant

if

there were any regard of the weal public.

v. t. w. a common w.

Vestorius

wrote

unto me

that you show your self very thankful

unto me.

This your good remembrance of me

likes me wonderful well,

and easily do I endure

you

to use

it,

as

with others,

so in truth

with our friend Siro,

For I desire

all my actions

may be very well approved,

to every most wise man.

I am desirous

to see

you

as soon as may be.

Fare you well.

Cicero S. D. Trebatio. 43 7 14
Crysippus Vettius,

the freeman

of Cyrus the worke-maister,

caused

me to think,

that you were not unmindfull

of me,

for he did your commendations

v. for he declared health, in your words,

unto me.

you are

now

very dainty,

who

disdain

to send me a letter,

especially

by a man

almost

of the same house.

Now if

you have forgot

to write,

not many

v. an Advocate, an Attorney

shall fail in their suites.

In case

you have forgot

us,

I will do what I can

to come,

v. that I may c.

I do altogether slip,

v. plainly flow out,

out of your memory,

v. o. of y. mind,

Or if

the fear

of Summers heat

i. of the war which is like to be this Summer.

does make you faint,

devise

one thing or other,

v. something,

as

you did

about Britain.

Very gladly sure

heard I

that

of ye same Crysippus

that you were

familiar with

Caesar,

yet in truth,

I would rather choose

that

which

were

more convenient,

to understand

very often

of your own matters

by you own letters.

which doubtless

might thus be brought about,

if

you would rather choose

thoroughly to learn

the laws

i. to love your friend well, rather then to be a cunning brabler,

of friendship

then

of discord.

But

I have merrily spoken

n. pln. pro sing.

these things,

both

after your fashion,

and

somewhat too

after mine,

I love you heartily,

and I both desire,

and am also persuaded

that you do love me.

Fare you well.

Cicero S. D. Cassio. 44 12 8
I think

you have intelligence of

the wicked pranke

and passing great levity

and

inconstancy

of your kinsman Lepidus,

from the things registered

which

I am well assured

was sent

unto you.

Therefore

the war being ended

as

we did think,

we

do make war afresh:

and rely

v. and have

our whole trust

on Decius Brutus,

and

Plancus:

if

you will have the very truth of it

on your self,

and

on my Brutus,

not only

for a present refuge,

if,

which

I am very loath,

v. I would not

any misfortune

shall fall out,

but also

for the confirmation

of a perpetual liberty.

We heard

here

of Dolabella,

as we wished:

but

we had not

known reporters

v* sure Authors.

Know

that you are

a great man,

both

in the present conceit of men,

and

in the expected hope,

v. in the expectation,

of the time to come.

This being set before

you,

see

that

you strive

to the vpshot.

v. to the highest.

There is nothing

so difficult,

which

the citizens of Rome

v. the people of R,

thinks not

may

be atchiued

and

gotten

by you

Fare you well.

Cicero S. D. M. Lepido. 45 10 27
In that

I have a singular care,

in regard of my exceeding love

toward you,

that

you be

in most honorable state:

I took it in ill part

that you showed not your self thankful

to the Senate,

seeing

you were

graced

by that state

with the greatest honors.

I rejoice

that you are

desirous

of procuring peace

amongst the subjects,

v. a.t. Citizens,

If

you distinguish

that peace

from bondage,

you shall provide well

both

for the weale-publick

and

you own honor.

But in case that

this peace

shall again set

that man past al goodness

v. t. lost m.

in possession,

of his most mischievous dominering,

v. of h. m. impotent dom. without right and reason,

know you

that all men that be well in their wits are

of this opinion,

that

they would prefer

death

before bondage,

Therefore

you shall deal

more wisely

in my judgment,

if

you thrust not

your self

into this peacemaking

i. into t. pretended peace, or to be one which should persuade the^ to peace
or to conclude a peace,

which

is approved

neither

of the Senators

nor

the Commons,

nor

any good man.

But

you shall hear

these things

of others,

or else

be certified

by writing.

You

in your own wisdom,

shall discern

what

is

best

to be done.

Fare you well.

For all this

v. y.w. pleasure him

by all means

which

you may

do

without trouble to your self,

and account him

v. and have

as one of your own friends

v. in the number of yours

and carefully provide

that

he may know

that this letter of mine

has stood him in great stead,

v. has been of great use to him

I shall like that maruelously well.

v. that shall be to me

acceptable in greater manner

Fare you well

Cicero. S.P. Planco imp. Cos. des. 54 10 13
So soon as

occasion served

v. power was given.

to further your honor

I omitted

nothing

in gracing of you,

which

lay

either

in putting dignities upon you

v. in the reward of virtue

or

in speaking honorably of you

v. in the honor of words

you may

perceive

v. know

so much

v. that

by the Senats decree:

for so

it is recorded,

as

sentence

was delivered

by me,

out of my writing,

which

a very great Senate

followed

with passing great care,

and a general consent.

I,

howbeit

I had perceived

by your letter

which

you sent

unto me,

that you took delight

rather

in the judgment

of good men,

then in the badges

of glory:

yet

thought

that we were to consider,

although

you required

nothing

how much

ye common wealth was

indebted unto you

v. was due to you from the co. wealth

You shall confer

id est. you shall make the vpshot of: you shall make a full end

the last

with the first.

For let him dispatch

the war,

who

put Mark Antony to the worst.

v. oppressed

Therefore

Homer

termed

not Ajax,

nor Achilles,

but Ulysses,

the Citty-waster:

Fare you well.

Cicero S.D. Cassio 55 12 6
You may

know

of C. Titius Strabo

v. some say Tidius

an honest man

and

judging

rightly

of the common wealth:

for

what

shall I say

one that loves you exceedingly

v. most desirous of you

who

leaving house and goods

came

principally

unto you.

What

were

the state

of matters

at that time

when

I sent

this Letter?

Therefore

I do not so much as recommend

him

unto you:

his own coming

shall recommend

him

sufficiently

unto you.

I would that you so think

and persuade

your self

that all the refuge

for good men

stands

v. to be put, placed

in your self

and Brutus,

if

(which

I would be loath)

any ^ucethwartnesse

v. adversity

shall (...).

Our (...),

(...)

(...)

these things

were

brought

unto ye very last push

v. into utter danger.

For Brutus

hardly

at this time

held out

before Moden

v. b. Mutina

who

if

he be preserved

we are victors,

if otherwise

(which ill luck

God turn another way)

all the running

of the whole City

v. of all

is

unto you.

Therefore

see

you have

so good a courage

and so good provision

as

is needful

for the recovering of the whole commo^wealth.

Fare you well.

Cicero S.P.Q. Cornificio collegae. 56 12 17
Your remembrance

of us

which

you signified

in your letter,

is exceedingly well pleasing

unto me:

which

I desire earnestly

that

you would continue:

v. t. you w. preserve

not that I doubt

of your constancy,

but

because

the manner

of desiring

is so:

Some very seditious matters

are told

us

out of Syria,

which

because

they be

nearer

you,

then

us,

do the rather move

me

for your sake

then

for mine own.

There is

exceeding great quietness

at Rome,

but so,

that one would rather have

v. th.y.w. rather have

some good

v. wholesome

and commendable employment,

v. a. honest business,

which

I hope

will be

because

I perceive

v. I see

Caesar has care thereof.

v. t. to be a care to C.

Know you

that I

so long as

you be away,

have gotten

(as it were)

some occasion

and

liberty

to write

more boldly,

and indeed

perchance

the rest,

which

even your self

would yield unto.

But

last of all

I have written

of the best kind

of pleading.

Wherein

many times

I have feared

that you

do a little dissent

from our opinion:

namely so,

as

one learned man

from another not unlearned.

I could most heartily wish

that you would give approbation

to this brook,

out of your judgment,

if not

for affection sake,

v. for the cause of favor.

I will bid

your friends

to write it out

v. t. they write it over

if they would,

and send it

unto you.

For I am of this mind,

v. f. I think

although

you shall hardly like of

the work

yet

in this great leisure

v. in th. solitariness

whatsoever

comes

from me,

will be

well-pleasing

unto you.

Whereas

you do recommend

your reputation

and honor

unto me:

you deal indeed

after the fashion

of all:

but

I would have you thus to think,

that I,

both

do attribute

very much

to the love

which

I know

to be

reasonably equal

v. mutual

between us:

as also

yt I have that conceit

of your passing great wit

and

of your excellent studies,

and

of the hope

of most honorable promotion

that

I can prefer

none

before you,

compare with you

a few.

Fare you well.

Cicero S.P.Q. Thermio Propraet. 57 13 54
Whereas

many things

be

acceptable

unto me,

which

you

moved

by my commendations

have done:

so especally

that

that you have most bountifully entertained

Mark Marcilius

the son

of my friend

and

interpreter

v. one that uses to go before me, a messenger.

For he came

to Laodicea,

and

showed himself exceedingly thankful

both

unto you

being with me

and

to me

for your sake.

Wherefore

as for that that remains

I crave

at your hands

seeing

you bestow

your kindness

upon grateful persons,

that

so much ye more willingly

you would pleasure

them

and do your endeavor

so far forth as

your credit

will permit,

that

the mother-in law

of the young man

be not found guilty.

Whereas

I recommended

Mark Marcilius

heretofore

earnestly,

so

at this instant

much more earnestly,

because

in his long pursevant-ship

v. in the long performance of his office, attendance

I had experience of

v. I knew

the singular

and

well nie incredible

trustiness,

temperance

and modesty

of Marcilius the father.

Fare you well.
