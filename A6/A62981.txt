A TORY in a Whig's Coat: A New English BALLAD,
To an Old Scotch Tune, Up with Ayley, etc.
[1]
WHat! still ye Whigs uneasy!
Will nothing cool your Brain,
Unless Great Charles, to please-ye,
Will let ye drive his Wain?
Then up with P -- and O --,
And up with Knaves a pair;
But down with him that Votes
Against a Lawful Heir.
[2]
Your Grievance is removed,
Old Stafford's made a Saint,
Though you but little proved,
The Karle away is sent.
Then up with all your spite,
And show us what you mean;
I fear me, by this Light,
Ye long to vent your Spleen.
[3]
That Peerless House of Commons,
So zealous for the Lord,
Meant (piously) with some on's
To flesh the Godly's Sword:
Then up with au the Leaven,
With each Dissenting Loon,
Then up with Bully Stephen;
But College is gone done.
[4]
What would those Loons have had?
What makes 'em still to mutter?
I think thy're au gone mad,
They keep so muckle clutter:
Then up with P -- and S --,
Another Blessed Pair;
And up with every Brute;
But chiefly Goatham's Mayor.
[5]
Our Salamanca-Priest
Has left his Flock in have;
And shrewdly is he mist;
Which makes us all aghast:
Then up with Lads of worth,
With Baldwin, Vile and Care;
For these must now hold forth,
And Dick shall nose a Prayer.
[6]
But is awr Parson gone;
And whither gone I trow?
What, back again to Spain?
Geud Faith e'n let him go:
Then up with blundering S.
The Tories Plague, I trow;
It Is he our Cause must bless
With Characters, and so. --
[7]
But scurvy Heraclitus,
And Roger too, is rude,
And Not, who plagues poor Titus,
Which makes us chew the Cud:
Then up with Associations,
Remonstrances and Libels;
It Is these must save Three Nations,
And will preserve our Bibles.
[8]
The Polish Fox does seem
To sleep his time away;
But his pernicious Dream
Is (only) to Betray:
Then up with How. the Mole,
And many more that be;
But up with Little Pole
Upon the highest Tree.
[9]
Hieraclitus is a Debtor,
To some within the City,
Who sent him sike a Letter,
He Will pay them in a Ditty:
Then up with au Dissenters,
Up with 'em in a Cart:
And up with him that ventures
His Majesty to thwart.
[10]
But now Great YORK is come,
(Whom Heaven still be with)
You Will find (both all and some)
'Twas ill to show your Teeth:
Then up with every Roundhead,
And every Factious Brother,
You're Luck is now confounded,
Ye au must up together.
LONDON, Printed for Allen Banks, Anno Domini. 1682.
