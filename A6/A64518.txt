TO THE READER.
THE Collection of the following Tables, I first made for my own Use, but being
importuned by some Friends of mine to oblige them with a Copy, and the
transcribing of them being very troublesome, I at last resolved to Print them,
in order to content my Friends, and to oblige the public.

The Tables are exact to a day, and though many will wonder how a particular Man
could come to the knowledge of it, yet those that are versed in Genealogy will
easily know from whence they are taken.
