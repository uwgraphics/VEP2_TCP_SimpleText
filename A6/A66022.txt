The Laws Subversion OR, Sir John Maynards Case truly stated. BEING A perfect
Relation of the man(...)s imprisonment upon pleasure, for the space of (...)
months by the House of Commons, and of the Impeachment of high Treason
exhibited against him before the Lords, together with all the passages between
him and the Lords, in Messages to them, and Speeches at their Bar, as they
were taken from his own mouth.

Wherein also is contained a clear discovery of the dangerous and destructive
infringement of our native Liberties, and of the arbitrary Government now
introduced by an aspiring Faction over-awing the Parliament.

Also that groundless false report concerning Sir John Maynards submitting to
the Lords Jurisdiction refuted, to the shame of the Reporters.

Sir John Maynards Case truly stated.
MUch admired Aristotle (Tutor to the greatest Emperor Alexander the great)
was of opinion, that the Laws, (...). Pol^^. l. 3. c. 10. p. 10^. 2^^.
not Kings, Princes, or Magistrates, be they one or more or never so good*
ought to be sole ^ords or Rulurs of the Commonwealth, and that Princes and
Governors ought to govern by the Laws, and cannot command what the Laws do
not command, and ^n his judgment those who command that the Law should rule,
command that God should rule but he that commands a man to be a Prince, i. e.
to be an absolute Ruler, commands that ^^th a man and beast should be Prince^*

Mag^strates and the very best of me^, out the Law^^ a constant and quiet mind,
and reason, ^o^d of all (...) and desire: answerable to this opinion have (...)
proceeded in their first Constitution of their Governm^^^^* Pelitius says,
that Kingdoms See (...). Hist. 6. p. ^2^.
were first erected and (...) on the worthiest men by the free voluntary joint
^^^sent of the people, and founded and co^fi^med be Customs and Laws of each
Country, and th^^efo^e they o^l^ged their King to conform their Government
unto the Law^s established; so Dioderus Si^ulus testifies of the Egyptians,
that their Kings See Hist. ^^bl. l. ^. Sect. 20. p. 61, 62, 63.
were bound to conform the Regiment of their Kingdoms and their lives and
families to the Laws establ^shed, and were obnoxious to sensures in case of
defaults, and Zeneph^^ testifies the same of the Lacedemontans, and zer. d^
Lacedem. Repub. p. 690.
Licurgu^ being little less then an Oracle in his time, took an Oath every
month to govern the Kingdom according to the Laws ^nacted, and M. T. Cicero
informs us of the famous Roman State, that the people gave Laws to all their
Magistrates, by which they should order their Government, thus much may be
deduced from these words, Imperium in Magistratibus, Authoritatem in S^^at^,
(...). pro Rabino.
potestatent in plebe, Majestatem in populo, command was in the Magistrates,
Authority in the Senate, power in the men^all people, and majesty in the people
in general, so Livy has these words frequently, (...) decre^^^, populus
jussit, the Senate has decreed the people commanded, and whoever has leisure
to read Purc^^ pilgrimage and voyages, Peter Martyrs Jud. Hist. Boemus de
m^ribus Gentium, Strabo, and such other Histories, shall find that the
Athenians, Persians, Corinthians, Medes, and Germans, Swe^es, D^nes, etc.
prescribed to all their Governors, Laws and Rules whereb^ to govern and
reserved to themselves Sovereign power to prescribe farther Laws and limits
to their Kings and M^gistrates, and to call them to a public account for their
off^^ces and misgovernment, and thus A^drew Horn See Me^rour of Justice, ^. 21
p. ^.
an ancient Lawyer informs us, that when the forty Saxon Princes, which for
some time r^led this Nation, chose to themselves a King, they made him swear
at his ^n^^garation, that he should govern the people by rules of Law without
regard to the person of any, and that he should be obedient to suffer right as
well as any of the people, and at the Coronation of Kings unto this day there
is an Oath appointed wherein they s^eare See Parliament Dec. of Sep 2. ^^ 42. 1
part bo^k Dec. p. 712. 713.
to keep the Laws and Customs then established, and to grant and defend all
such rightful Laws as the Commons of the Realm shall choose.

And without controversy this concurrent practice of the Nations in obliging
all Magistrates to govern by Laws only, was founded upon impreg^^ble reason
and equity.

Every Nation is but a rude ind^gested, Chaos a deformed lump until Laws or
rules of Government be established, Laws are the vi^ plistica or formatrix
that forms the principal vitalls, the heart, the bra^ne, the liver of the
Commonwealth, as it is such the Law^s of every people puts the difference (as
to them) between things judicial^, just and unju^^, good and evil, the Laws
are the only measure and boundary of every man's right, interest and property,
without such rules of Government every man's right to any thing is equal, and
every man's t^tle to Magistracy or rule r^ns parallel with other, therefore when
the Laws of a people are destroyed, and Magistrates exercise dominion over
them, as being loose and absolved from all Laws or Rules of Government, and
obnoxious to no censures, then all things return to confusion, and every man's
depraved will become^ a law to himself, and as many as he can subdue by his
sword, then just, envy, malice, covetousness and ambition supply the place of
Law, and most men must be subject to their Dictates and decisions, th^^
faction, and private interest, exalt and abase, destroy and save alive at their
pleasures, then distractions, commotions and bloody massacres overspead the
face of a people, and no security remains to the estates, liberties or lives
of the people, more then to the wild beasts of the Forest.

Now what pu^blind eye cannot discern Englands fa^e in this Glass, are not
our Laws subverted and turned into arbitrary Decrees and resolutions, every
day rising and every day withering like M^shromes, and are we not governed by
those who conceive themselves absolved from all Laws or Rules of Government,
^^a are we not governed Jure vago and inc^^^^, by a leaden (...) Rule, to which
we cannot square our obedience, but in^st writ until the Grandees that guide
the Legislative power, measure our actions for us, or apply the Rule, m^^ we
not complain with the Frenchmen in Lewis the eleventh* tim^s that will is
law, and law is will, what is now more common then a transgression without a
Law, an accusation without an Accuser, and imprisonment without a cause
rendered, a sentence without a legal Judge, and ^ condemnation without a
legal hearing or trial; who can promise himse^fe the least safety either in
his life o^^ liberty, unles^e h^s mind and conscience be ta^quam (...)? as a
pure table wherein the prevailing faction may freely engrave the determinations
of their wills. I shall not for present endanger the Readers ey^s with an
uncessant e^^iux of brinish tea^^s by relating many of the do^efull tragedies
really acted upon our Libert^s; I shall ooe^^ give you an impartial narrative
of Sir John Maynards Ca^e, and of the wounds which our liberties have received
there^^.

And least any should view his Case with an e^^ whose pure Crystal line humor
is vi^^at^^ with prejud^^^, i. ^^me give you a Character of the Gentleman.

1. Sir John was bred a Courtier, and had ^^ least the favorable aspect, to
say no more, of King James and the present King Charles* yet his priv^te
engagements to the Court and his interest there, was to more to him when the
interest of his Country stood in comp^tition with the Courts, then the (...)
wyths 10 Sampson* he appeared with undaunted courage with the first that arose
to vindicate the Parliaments and the peoples cause, be lent ^10. pound upon the
first Propositions.

2. As he began with the first, so he persevered without w^vering when the
Parliament was in its most despicable condition, and their Army at the lowest
ebb, when the Army was new molded, and Sir Thomas Fairfax elected General^
his endeavors to promote that design were eminent, he lent 1000. l. and
procured 3000. l. more by his influence upon his friends toward that 8000. l.
which necessity then required.

^. For his demea^ our in Parliament, there is a cloud of witnesses, that
according to the Dictates of his cons^^ence, his endeavors for common justice
were eminent, but above all he was exemplary in opposing the Members mutual
gifts each to other out of the public treasury, be often inculcated that it
was illegal that F^ofees in trust for the people as the^ were, should dispose
of the public Treasury amongst themselves, and that it was contrary to their
Declarations, and destr^ctive to the Soldiery and the desol^te Widows and
Orphans, and that it rendered them infamous, a reproach and scorn amongst all
the people and to the adjacent Countries* if I did not much affect mode^^y in
parties which are Competitors, I would in large this Character.

But that which kind led the indignation of L. G. Cromwell and Commissary Genesis
Iret^n against Sir John, was his declaiming against the partiality, ambition,
cove^ousnesse and injustice of the Grande^^ of the Army, he testified his
dislike of that notable piece of injustice that L. G. Cromwells son Ireton
being the puny Colonel in the Army should upon the day of Naseby Battle be
advanced above all the Colonells to be Commissary General, and he imputed it
to this injustice that Commissary General Iretons Regiment, first turned their
backs in that Battle, and likewise he testified with some bitterness his
abhorrency of the unworthiness of some genera^l Officers in the Army which
lurked in a Wind mill a^ Nafeby Battle, viz. L. G. Ha^^mond, Sco^t-Master Genesis
Wa^sen, Muster M. General Stanes, and he was a constant sharp Antagonist to
the Independent party, wherein he only followed the Dictates of his cons^^ence.
This without con^toversie was the reason, that Sir John was one of the 11.
Members impeached by the Army, for L. G. Cromwell confessed at Colebrook that
they had nothing against him, this will be proved by witnesses, but whosoever
shall observe the Armies impeachment of the 11. Members will discern that
there is nothing against Sir John in any of the Articles, unless it be where
they mingle his name with others, to c^lour over their conspiracy against him;
but Sir John being an active man in the opposite party, there was a necessity
to remove such an obstructer of their Empire. And for the Articles of Treason
now against him for levying war, I only desire to acquaint the Reader* that Sir
John offered to produce two Members of Parliament, and other Witnesses, to
prove that he was at his house in Su^rey five miles from London, when the
London-ingagement, voted by the Parliament to be treason, was prosecuted, and
likewise when the ^^^ult happened which offered force and violence to the
Parliament, neither had he set in Parliament during the absence of those
Members which fled to the Army, had he not ^een commanded to attend the House,
and by Ordinance of Parliament appointed to be of the Committee of Safety.

Now to the stating of his Case.

First, about the^^ of September. last a Warrant issued forth by Order of the
House under the Speakers hand, to bring the body of Sir John Maynard to answer
to such things as should be objected against him. In the first s^ep of their
pro^eedings, to q^estion and prosecute Sir John, they deviated totally from the
paths of Law and Justice; and it is no wonder all the progress toward his
(...) is so irregular, the foundation of their proceedings against him is hid
upon will, pleasure, or a supposition of an absolute unlimited dominion, if the
Law should be acknowledged to be the measure of their proceedings, it is beyond
dispute, that the body of no Englishman can be legally arrested, (...) by
virtue of any Warrant, wherein some cause is not expressed, ^^d that with (...)
certainty and particularity, that it may appear judicially that the arrest is
^^^st: these are the express words of Ma^^^ Chart^, That no man shall be
t^k^n, that i^ arrested* or attached, or restrained of his libert^, unl^sse it
be b^ i^^^ctment or presentment, etc. and therefore Sir Edward C^^^* faith, 2.
Part. Instit. ^^l. 391. that a Warrant to restrain any person of his liberty,
to answer to such things as shall be objected against him, is utterly illegal*
and that very legal Warrant must have a lawful cause of the persons restra^nt
con^^^ned in it; and if the Law had not thus provided, we we^^ absolute
vass^l^s to the wilis of Magistrates, they might at their pleasure i^u^ fo^th a
Warrant to command the person of any man, 30. or 40. (...) distan^ from them to
be brought before them, to answer such things as shall be objected against him,
and when he appears there may be nothing material against him, or no crime
p^rtaining to the cognizance of that person or Court that issued out the
W^^rant, and yet again the same person through private malice might be (...) by
the like Warrant, and again also (...) his estate be conf^^med, or his ^^ad^
destroyed by such molestations and expenses incident (...), and upon the like
Warrant every Justice of the Peace might vex and m^iest whom they please:
therefore the Law permits ^or the h^^hest (...) in England to command (...)
despicable Englishman to attend him, or be arrested or brought before him
without a legal cause, and his office or authority specified in the Warrant or
Process, and upon this account the Parliament declared, July 26. 1642. that
it is against the Laws and Liberties of England, that any of the Subjects
should be commanded by the King to attend him at his pleasure, first Book
Tarl. Decl. p. 4^^. Now who can distinguish between an absolute command to
attend a Court, or Magistrate, and a Warrant to appear before them, without a
lawful cause specified? But though the axe is laid to the root of Englands
Liberties, by this first Warrant to appear before them, yet I wish this first
stroke had been con^ound^d with the last, b^t they proceeded to cut in sunder
the p^^me roots of ^reedome.

Secondly, Sir John Maynard obeying M. Speakers illegal Warrant, and att^nding
the House, M. Miles Corbet made his report concerning him from the Committee,
and produced some papers, pretending they were written by Sir John, and
thereupon M. Corbet examined Sir J^hn upon interrogatories, as whether those
papers were written or subscribed by him, and this interrogatory they doubled
and redoubled: Observe reader how they wander in the devious crooked wa^es of
injustice, when they have fors^^en the paths of righteousness; see the
deformity and obliquity of their actions, when they refuse to measure them by
the rules of the Laws established. Was it possible 5. years since to have
possessed any ingenious man, that this Parliament would have deviated so far
from the rules of law and justice, yea the common light of nature, as to
examine any man upon interrogatories against himself in a criminal case? would
any have believed that this Parliament should have degenerated so far, as to
endeavor to compel a man to destroy himself? Is it not a ^^ddle surpassing
all, that this monstro^s age has produced, that this Parliament, that has
deemed the Star Chamber and the Council Table^ names worthy to be a curse
and a byword ^o posterity, because of their cruelty in censuring men for
refusing to answer interrogatories, that this Parl. I say, should urgently
press Sir Io. Maynard to answer interrogatories against himself in this
criminal case? Is it credi^le that this Parl. who complained in their first
Remonstrance of the state of the Kingdom (1. part Book Dec. p. 8.) (...) upon
the people? or that th^s (...) ^ct of (...)* is ^^ ^redible* I say, that they
(...) ^ands have destro^ed, who c^n (...) rather ^mpute these proceedings to
the (...) ^ohn it seems, resented (...) to answer M. Corbe^^ redoubled Que^es,
ave^ring (...) had better taught him then to ^^st (...) own destruction. I wi^h
Sir John had kept his ground, (...) defia^ce to the in^ade^s of Englands
Liberties in this particular, with as much (...) has since manifested in some
other particulars of (...) importance: but by (...) estooped beneath h^mse^fe;
F^rb^ their importunity ^ee ans^^red their interrogatories negetively, That
ne^^^er ^^e papers pr^^^c^d, nor the ^^me sub^

Sir John Maynard humbly moved for a Copy of the Charge brought 3. Liberty
in^rieged.
into the H^use against ^i^ b^ Mr. Corbet, and time and Lib^rty to exam^^^ his
own w^t^^ss^s by whom ^e ^ffered to p^^v^ the falsity of the most m^^^ria^l
things obj^cted against him.

But such was the rigor of the prosecute^s and Ju^^e (for they went one and
the same) that Magna Charta, P^^i^^n of Right, the Stattute o^ 37. ^dw: 3. 18.
and the Statute 38. Edw: 3. and the 42. Edw: 3 3. not one, ^o^all of these,
could either by their glittering bea^es of Justice a^lu^^ them, or by an awfu^l
Majesty constrain them, to preserve inviolate this Na^ive Liber^y, though the
recited sta^ute say expressly, that no man shall be taken etc. nor disfrienged
of his Free-h^uld; but by the lawful Judgment of his Peers, or by the Law of
the Land: that is, by being brought to answer by due proces^e of Comm^n Law:
now who is ignorant that it is contrary to all the p^^^^edings at Common Law, to
have a Charge in an English Court, and yet to be denied a Copy, whereupon to
return answer, or to be denied Council in the (...) of Law? was it ever
known, that the m^st infam^^s se^^n was denied Counsel at the Kings Be^ch
Bar, if ^^ pleaded the insuffi^cenc^y of the indictment in Law? and (...)
more u^ a^swerable reason that Sir John should have had a Copy of the House of
Commons Charge, being it is an English Court, and C^u^cell also assigned him
upon his Pica, that the Charge against him was not leg^ll.

Notwithstanding all these ir^eguler arbitrary proceedings, the House 4.
Liberty in^rierged.
being reduced to about ^^. pas^^d Judgment upon Sir John Maynord, t^^t he
should be expelled the House.

Observe how the foundation of Englands Freedom is subverted, this Gentleman, a
Commo^er of England, is dis^eized of his c^o^sest Franchises, or Liberties, the
place of highest trust, contrary to the established Laws. This Censure is
passed upon him wit^o^^ one witness being heard in op^n Court, either pr^ or
co^, and the Gentleman that made the report from the Committee only named one
witness (which he said he could produce) as to any particular objected against
him: Now by the Statute of 5. Edw: 6. C. 11. It is provided that no man should
thenceforth be indicted for any Tre^so^ that then was, or from that time should
b^, from June then next ensuing, perpetrated, committed, or done, unless the
offender be thereof accused by two lawful accusers, except the party shall
without violence conlesse the same, yet here you see a Judgment in Parliament
passed against S^r John for the pret^nded c^ym^s which they style T^^ason,
although there was a pretense but of one acc^^er, or witness to any (...)

2. This Judgment is passed against this Gentleman, before his Pica to the
legali^y of the Charge was freely a^gued by Council, and j^stly determi^ed;
whereas comm^n reason dictates that the matter of ^^ct come^ not in question
until the Charge or accasation, be it as it ^ught ^o be, by perscentment or
indictment, un^il I see the legality of that be determined. Now if the
C^mmone^s of England may be disleized of their ch^isest Freedoms and
privileges, contrary to the known Law, yet to the universal Commands of
nature; what Basis or foundation of Freedom remains firm? what security to
the life of any Commoner of England, more then the good will of the prevailing
party.

But a further progress was made toward subversion, of our Liberties. 5.
Liberty infrienged
A further Judgment was passed against Sir John Maynard. viz. That he (...) to
the Tower, to remain a prisener there, during the pleasu^e of the H^n^^.

There was no cause specified of this censure, either in the Clerks Book, or
in the Warrant, or Mittimus directed to the Lieutenant of the Tower.

By virtue of an Order of the House of Commons, these are to require you to
receive from the Serjant at Arms, or his Deputy, the Body of Sir John Maynard,
Knight of the Bath, into the Tower of London, and him there to detain in safe
Custody: as your Prisoner, until the pleasure of the House be signified to you
to the contrary: And for so doing, this shall be your Warrant.

To the Lieutenant of the Tower in London.
Dated. Sept. 1647. William Lenthall Speaker.


Here is the impoysoned arrow shot through the principal Vital of Englands
Liberty, here is equity, Law, and Justice de^hroned, and absolute will, or
blind lust challenging the proper imperial seat of England. This Commitment
draws the black line over the name of English Fredom, yea the line of
confusion upon the K^ngdom. If the Supreme Authority shall thus actually a^ow,
that they are to Govern, ^^ose and dis^olve all Laws of Government* This was
declared in the Pa^l^ament^ first Remo^stra^ce of the state of the Kingdom, to
be the grand design of (...) to absolve the Government ^to^^ all restrai^t^^
^aw^s, and persons, and estates
to di^pose of the persons of the people at their pleasure; then all mutual
relations and dependency of a Kingdom, and all the terms of destinction
between Rulers and ruled, may be (...) the foundations of property are
overturned, and no man (...) thing his own: but himself, and what ever he
injoyes is at the pleasure of others. This man's of imprisoning this Gentlman
is a two edged sword, whereby our Liberties are mortally wounded.

1. Here is an imprisonment without a cause expressed, and what is such a
Commitment less th^n a virtuall public Declaration, that you shall be
destroyed in your Liberties, reputes, estates, and your lives ind^ngered
because we will. Though their should be a just legal cause of imprisoning any
man; yet if it be not expressed in the Order or Warrant: our Liberty is no
less sub^erted, then if their were no c^l^ur, o^ pretense of a crime in the
least punctilio; the rule of the Law is, inter ^on apparentia ^t non existentia
eadem est ratio, there ^s no difference between things that are not, and things
that appear not; Its invincib^y avident, that our persons are absolute vassals
to the wills of Governors, if a warrant for the imprisoning any man without a
cause specified therein should be allowed as just or Legal.

Sir Edward Cook in the 2, part (...), fo. 591. averrs, that its the special
thing required to make a mi^ti^^s Legal, that the cause be expressed with such
convenient certainty, and may appear Iudicially, that the offense requires
such a Judgment as imprisonment; Therefore the crime of a supposed off^nder
imprisoned, must be in some sort particularized in the Mittimus, according to
that of Festus, Act. 25. 26. 27. H^ ^ought for some certain crime to insert
into Paul's Mittimus, whereby he should be sent to Caesar; For says he, it seems
unreasonable to send a prisoner and not witha^l to signify the crimes laid
against him. And this is the true intent of Magna Carta, c. 29. wherein it
says, that no man shall be taken, or imprisoned without persentment, or
Indictment etc. I could multiply reasons in this particular. As 1. from the
indictment of an offendo^ which ought to rehearse the effect of the Mittimus,
and therein the particular crime, must be expressed. A second taken from the
forms of the Habeas corpus, which ought not to be denied to any offender out of
the King's Bench, or out of the Chancery, the words are these.

Precimus vobis quod Corpus A. B. etc. vna cum causa dect^ntionis su^, and
habeatis coram nobis and c. ad subijciendum et reci^ien^m ea quae curia nostra
etc.

This Writ is to be directed to the Jailer, or Sheriff detaining the prisoner,
wherein he is commanded to bring the body of A. B. with the cause of his
detention to receive, and suffer what the Court shall Order according to the
Law. Now the Jailer is to return his Warrant to the Court, by virtue whereof
he keeps any men prisoner, and if there be not a Legal cause and authority
expressed, its false imprisonment, and the Jailer may be indicted So Cooks
Exp^. of Magna Charta. 2. part Just. p. 55.
for it, upon the (...). of Magna Charta, or an action of false imprisonment
lies against him: and let it be observed that a general criminal head, as
treason, felony, etc. is no legal cause to be incerced into the Mittimus, its
no sufficient return by the Jailer of the cause of his detaining a prisoner;
for the Court can pass no Judgment upon an offender, neither can any
indictment be grounded upon such a Mittimus, wherein the crime is expressed only
i^ such a generallity.

The second wound which out Liberties have received by this Gentleman's
imprisonm^nt, is by this Order to detain him during pleasure, O this! this. I
say strikes the fatal stroke to freedom and Justice: this overturns,
overturns, overturns the foundations of the Kingdom; this one Act, if approved
or drawn into presiden, has a seminall virtue whereby it contai^ed in it; self
all the distinct species of injustice whereof the s^^ was ever ye^ spectatours.

1. T^is imprisoning without c^use specified, during pleasure, if ^t shall be
av^w^d by Parliam^nt, does ipso fa^t^ enervate yea evacuate, and null a^l
established Laws of the La^d; it renders all Rol^s and Records, no better then
wa^te papers to l^ght Tobacco; to what purpose serves Magna Ch^rta, the
Pet^tion of Right and other wholesome Laws, which say no man shall be imprisoned
passed upon etc. or any way^s destroyed; but by the Judgment of his equals or
by due pr^cesse ^t law.

Again, i^ we shall be destroyed of our liberies at the ple^sures and during
the pleasures of corrup^ men, and if any Englishman may be detained a prisoner,
during the pleasures of others, of what use are those Laws that provide a
Habeas Corpus, should be granted out of the Kings Bench, or Chancery; whereby
the Goalers commanded, that the person of any complaining of injust
imprisonment, be brought before the Judges, with the cause of his restraint,
that as Sir Edw. Cook says, if he be imprisoned (...) 2. (...) 55 (...)
contrary to the Law of the Land, they may by virtue of Magna Charta deliver
him, and if it be doubtful and under consideration, he may be bayled.

This was also resolved by all the Judges of England, that upon complaint of
any prisoner they ought to send the Kings writs ^or his body, and (...) 2.
(...) p. (...)
to be cert^fied of the particular c^use, and that in case they shall find no
legal cause of his imprisonment, they ought and are bound by oath to deliver
him; but of what use are these Laws, and D^clarations of Law, if persons may
be detained in prison, be it justly or u^justly, during the pleasures of any
number of men whatsoever? I must prof^sse, I know no other use of the Laws
then to show the boldness and presumption of injustice, that dare tram^le
upon the Laws and L^berties of the people, when they are most solemnly and
eviden^ly declared.

2. This Commitmen^ during pleasure, establishes the wills or lusts of m^n: as
the rule whereby to punish transgressors: suppose they be real ^ffendors that
are imprisoned, yet if they must be disseized of their Liberties, Trade^, and
other Employments, during the pleasures of men, then their punishment is
measured by the rule of their p^easure: and if men shall be censured in case of
supposed or real offenses according to the pleasures of others, then those
men's wills or pleasures, must necessarily also be the rule wher^by the ^ffences
must be measured, as to the degrees, ye^, whereby all the actions of men shall
be tried, whether they be just, or u^just, good, or evil, and in case 500.
shall assume and arrogate to thems^lve^, the abs^lu^e Dominion ever us, that it
may be England shall have 500. di^^^nct lusts, unto which they must conform
their actions.

3. This Commitment during pleasure, supposes the persons exercising that
authority, to be unaccountable and ob^^^ious to ^o censures, for any possible
ab^se of their power; If their pl^a^u^e be the supreme rule, whereby they
shall judge of the peoples actions, and ce^su^e them to the loss of their
Liberties and dearest enjoyments, then there is no rule whereby to measure the
recti^^de or obliquity, justice, or injustice of their Government, and by
cons^q^ence they are under an imp^ssibility to render an account of their
ways: this the Parliament ab^^orred in the King, as appears by their last
Declaration, showing the reason of their Votes, not to make nor receive any
addresses to, or from the King, p. 12. they say the King has laid a fit
foundation for all Tyranny, by that most distructive maxim, viz. that he o^es
an acc^mpt of his (...), to none but to God alone; but whether this principle
be esteemed by the present Grande^s that overawe the Parliament, too sweet a
morsel for any palate, except their own: I will not determine.

4. This impriso^ing during pleasure expeseth the Liberties. Estates, (if not
the lives) and all the people to perpetual uncertain^y; who can perfect^,
soresee what construction the ruling Gen^lemen shall please to put upon the most
innoc^nt actions, and inten^i^ns of any which are not blessed with the^r
graci^us aspect? ^ow plausibly and with what facility may they at least
question their actions* and upon what fair pretenses may they commit them to
p^^s^^ns? and if this shall remain during their pleasures, they solely depend
upon the uncertain, inconstent wills of a ^ew G^andees; for the enjoyment of
their Liberties, Trades, and (...): o^ howev^r upon the least pretense of a
transgression, any man shall be imprisoned during pleasure* by the heads of the
present faction or by their i^fl^^^ce upon the Parliament, and th^n his Liberty
is lost for ever, and it may be his Family there by utterly ruined, being under
an impossibility of regai^ing his freedom, unles^e he can please and satisfi^,
either by c^eeping and cringing, or otherwise, the ambitious ^umours or corrupt
wills of those sta^ists. I might here also oportu^ely discover the abhorancy of
perpetual imprisenment, or during the pleasure of any m^n manifested in the
Statute and Common Law, and likewise what exquisite care the Law has taken for
the Liberties of men's persons, by the Law of the Land, before the ^^^que^t: as
app^ares by the Laws of Ethel^ed, a man was ba^leable for any offerce* until
he was co^victed, and Sir ^^ward C^^ke says, that by the Common Law, a man
accused or indicted of Treason, or of any F^lony whatsoever, was bayleable upon
(...) surety; for the Goal was only his pledge that could ^i^d none, and
though some sta^u^es have since ab^^dged that liberty; yet the writs deodio and
atia, still in force to helps such to bail, as are accused of Fe^^ny, and the
care taken, that every man may have an Habeas Corpus, by imposing an Oath upon
the Judges, and providing remedies, in case any should refuse to obey the writ
of Habeas Corpus, those things I say manifest the tenderness of the Law, to
every man's liberty, and it is a obhorency of long tedious or perpatuall
imprisonment at pleasure, and the Law never intended, neither does allow
imprisonment to be a punishment; but only a safe Custody See Cork 1. part.

until the ordirary appointed times of Trial.

But I find it objected by some, that the Parliament is above Laws, and
statutes, yea, Magna Charta it self, and cannot be confined within their
bounds* in their imprisoning supposed off^^ders and therefor may imprison anyn
an during pleasure: this I confeste is the opinion of the faithful and valiant
sufferour Mr. Prin in his Sovereign power of Parliaments. 4. part p. 27.

Answ. I concelve this to be a gross mistake, confounding the legislative
power with the power judicial, and executive of the Laws: its unquestio^able,
that the law-giving power of the Parliament is suptean^e to all the Statutes
enacted by ^ormer Parliament^, ^h^y may at pleasure alter and rep^ale them,
either totally or in part^^ct th^s law-giving power is not absolutely supreme
to Magna Charta, who'ly at their pleasure; this great Charter has (...)
consideration, either as it is in part a Statut^ Law, and so it is subject to
the pleasure of the Parliament, to be altered, repealed, or confi^med, or as it
is a Declar^^ion of ^^e common Law, or of comm^n reason and equity, and thus
t^s not pr^st^^^e at the sect of the Parliaments will. In the trust comm^t^ed
by the people to the Parliament, to be legis^a^or; it is ^aturally* and
necessarily employed and supposed; that common reason and equity should be a law
to their; and thence it is received as ^n und^^b^e maxim that comm^^ (...) may
annull an Act o^ P^rli^ment; but whilst Sta^u^e ^^ws, are not ^epealed by
v^r^ue of the legislitive power, I supp^^^ they are as obligatory t^ the
Parliament; either joy^^ly, or i^parately considered as to the meanest C^^m^n^r
in England.

And for their Judicial power in declari^g the Law in particular cases before
them, I conceive they are not, even in that, purely unlimitted, or absolut^:
they a^e li^i^t^d, as to the Laws wherein that Judicia^l power is to b^
ex^^c^sed; the pe^all laws being in their own nature declara^ive, (...) not the
object of that power; ^uch laws ought to be taken in the letter only, not by
consequence or const^uction, otherwise they should ^^pl^y a contradiction to
themselves; for b^ing who^ly declarative as they are p^nall, they should yet
not be declarative, and its ^n undoubted maxim, that D^us non potest
c^ntradictoria* God himself cannot do things contradict^^y, and I hope
Parliaments are more mode^t then to challenge a power supreme to his.

2. The Parliament is limited in their Judicial power, in declaring the Law
where Laws may be taken by way of consequence, eq^ity or construction: therein
common reason is also a Law to these Judges of the Law.

And for the Parliaments power in executing the Law, which is their power of
imprisoning and censuring ^ffendors; either they are to^ally subjected to the
Law, and ob^^eged to proceed according to Law, or else they cannot judge m^n as
transgressors. Its only then that men can be Ju^ged transgress^r^, when by a
measuring their actions by the Laws, they are found to have walked contrary to,
or swerved from the Law; But let it be observ^d, if the Parliament cla^ms a
power to imprison, as being ^^^r^sted to be Executors of the Law, then it
implies a contradiction, to say that power of theirs is above the Law, or that
they are not obliged to proceed in every pun^ilio, according to the declared
Law; for if there be the least abberration from the Law in their censuring or
imprisoning any man, they do not put the the Law in Execution, but execute
their lawless wills.

B^t I would inquire whether the Parliaments imprisoning ^y m^^, be an act of
their Jurisdiction ^ver hi^? If so, the^ ^^ the name of that power be weighed
(...), a Declaration of the Law; N^w ^^ implies another contradiction, to say
that the Parliament have ex^^cised (...) ^^^^sdiction ^ver (...) imprisoning
him above, and (...) unto Law* ^^ither can i^ be he^e said that the particular
order ^^ Parliament for imprisoning a^y man is a Law, and so is (...), ^
declaring the ^aw for it is u^terly (...) with ^^e nature ^^ the Legisl^tive
power to be Judge of what has been do^^, and should it be admit^^^, that
actions pa^^ might be Judged otherwise, then by the rules of distributive
Justice est^blished in a society of people o^ Kingdom, the very foundations of
the society or Kingdom were over turned; for the compact or Agreement of the
people to in habit together upon such and such terms, and to be obliged to
deal each with other according to such Rules; this compact I say were ^ull,
and the people were no more ^ body politic, but a confused ga^hering together
of people, every one without obligation to other; and therefore the Parliament
reputed it a most unworthy scandal, when the King accused them, that they
disposed of the subjects lives, and fortunes by (...) own Votes, ^^ntrary to
the known Laws of the Land. Se^ the Re^. of Sep. 2. 1 642. 1 part Took D^^la

Upon these grounds I shall presume to conclude, that a name is wanting to that

they appointed Judges of Sir John Maynard, as il^egall as the accusation, they
transmitted his case to the Lords Bar.

Hereupon the Lords directed a paper to the Lieuetenant of the Tower,
commanding him to b^ing in Sir John Maynard on Feb. 5. last past, the Copy
whereof here follows.

IT is this day ordered by the Lords in Parliament Assembled, that the
Lieuetenant of the Tower of London, do bring Sr. John Maynard Knight of the

To the Right Honorable my singular good Lord, EDWARD Earl of Manchester,
Speaker of the House of Peers.
My Lord,
I Received an Order in the name of this Honorable House, whereby I am
appointed to appear before you, to receive a charge of Articles of High
Treason, and other crimes, etc. Upon which account, I have made bold to write
these e^c^os^d lines, humbly desiring that they may be communicated to your
House.

Sir, I am your Lordships most humble servant, JOHN MAYNARD.
From the Tower of London, this 4. Feb. 1647.

My Lords,
I Am for Monarchy, and upon all occasions I have pleaded for the preservation
of the interest of this Honorable House: But my Lords, I being now summoned to
app^ar ^ef^^e your Lordships, for no less (as I conceive) then my l^fe, upon
an impeachment of High Treason, I am (being a (...)) necessi^ated to challenge
the benefit of Mag^a c^a^t^, and the (...) of Right, which is, to be tried by a
(...) of my (...) of my own condition, by an Indictm^nt, before the Judges in
the ^rd^nary Courts of Justice in Westminster Hall, who by the Law of this
Kingdom, are appointed to be the Administrators thereof* and by the express
Laws of the Kingdom, I am not to be proceeded against (for any crime
whatsoever, that ca^ be laid (...) my charge) any other way then by the
declared and expressed rules of the known and est^blished Laws of the land, as
is (...) ^^^ly evident by the express words of the Petition of Right (which
being an Englishman) I chal^enge as my Birthright and In^eritance, and I
rather presume to make this address unto this (...) H^^se, because I f^^de
upon ^^cord, that in the case of Sir Sim^n de Be^isf^rd, this Honorable House
have engaged never ^o judge a ^ommoner aga^n; because its against the Law of
the Land, ^e not being their (...).

This I ^umb^y ^eave to the consideration of this Honorable House, and take
leave to rest.

Your Lordships most humble Servant. JOHN MAYNARD.
Toke^ February 4. 1647.

But those Lords whereof the House is now (...), not (...) deny ^^edience to
the commands of the sword men and their c^mplices: pe^sisted in their Order to
the ^^cutenant of the Tower, and Sir ^ohn Maynard was on Feb 15 brought to
their ^atte, but a command was given, that the * door of their H^^se should be
shut, and that no man should be (...) access to hear: 6. (...) in^ringed.
and though Sir John Maynards Lady, children, and friends, pressed hard at the
door, yet Mr. F^^e Gent^eman (...) of the black rod, repelled them by violence;
hereupon Sir John Maynard ^u^bly moved, that according to the practice of a ^
Cou^ts of Justice, the d^^rs might be open, and all might have free access to
hear the proceedings.

But the speaker delivered the sense of the House, that ^^ company m^st come
in, before sir John Maynard^ charge was read.

Thereupon Sir John Maynard with reverence and respe^t* bes^ught their
Lordships, that in respect to their own Honor, the (...) of the House, and
that which was of more value then both, (...)* the preservation of the Law,
their Lordships would permit all whatsoever to hear: Its a cause (said he) of
^igh (...) ^t, for it involves the Liberty of all the Freeborn people of
England.

And I believe your Lorships cannot be ignorant what Books, (...) speeches are
daily uttered against you, as invaders of the peoples (...) rights and
freedoms: you are traduced to be a (...)* a Councel-table, ^^ worse: even a
spanish inquisition, and that all things are carried by faction: al^ the Orders
and common rules of Just^ce being daily broken: ^ea its said you exercised a
higher^ t^ (...) and more arbit^^ry power at present, then was practis^d by any
others in the worst of (...); but (says he) I have (...) several occ^sion^
to vindicate the Hon^^ur of th^s house; (...) Lordships will pr^f^^^t your
selves a court of (...); yet keep your doors shut whereas I have q^^shed such
reports) your Lordships will ^^ake them truth and ^^^dent to a^ the people.

But as the Lords had no ^u^idiction over him, so they wou^d (...) it to all
men they would exercise no Jurisdiction: t^^y would not declare the Law
concerning him, but their will: and so they kept doors shut, it may be they
esteem themselves supreme to the stat* of Ma^^bridge 52 H. 3. ^^: 1. which
expressly says, its provided that all persons of all degrees should receive
Justice in the Kings Courts. i. ^. the c^uses of all persons shall be heard
ordered, and determined openly in the Kings Court before the Judges, ^here no
man ought to be excluded or denied free access, and the reason of this is
imp^e, nable.

First, all proceedings are only particular declarations of the Law, its
intended that the Law should be understood by every man and therefore it was
ordained that Magna Chatta should be publicly read 4. times or twice at the
least in every cathed^^ll etc. And of old the Kings writ issued out at the end
of every Parliament to the Sh^e^ffe of every County commanding him to proclaim
and publish all the Acts made by the (...). in all places throughout his
Bayliwick: and to this purpose records are kept of the proceedings of the
Courts of Justice, that they might be visible to al men; for Laws not
promulgated or declared are no Laws. Therefore the denial of free access of
people to any Court of Justice subverts the very being of the Laws as much as
is possible to such a Court.

2. The just and prime rational and of proceedings against offenders is
subverted, when their proceedings are not as public and open as possib^^; he
punishment which the law ordain to be executed upon offenders is not the end of
the penal Laws, but for the peoples profit ^ that they by the cogniz^^ce of
the matter and manner of their offenses might more clearly distinguish between
good and ev^l^, and know how to order their ways without occasion of off^^ce
to the sta^e; a^^ als^, that the j^st (...) their transgressi^ns may (...)
inclinatio^s of ot^^ers to the (...) that of Sene^a Ad vindictu^^ (...) and
that (...) ren^^^^i en^m (...). W^ ^ug^t not to co^^ to the (...) as to matter
^f d^^^g^t, but (...) man pu^^sh (...) beca^se the Law is tran^g^^^^^d, (...)
not be transgressed, and d^^b^les it is ^epugnan^ to the na^^^e of man to b^
satisfied in inflicting punishment upon any man as it is pun^ish^ent; but the
b^ames of Justice should be totally ^clipsed, if Courts of Justice should be
permitted to be private in their proceedings.

3. An us^full medium unto I^stice and regular proceedings is re^^cted when
proceedings against ^^all or supposed offenders are not public* any learned
man says Sir Edward Co^ke in 3 parts ^nstitutes p. 29 that is present may
inform the court for the b^nefit of the prisoner of any thing that may make
there proceedings (...), and is i^ not necessary then that all men should have
free access to Courts of Justice that there may be the most perfect means to
dispose it imp^rtially? answerable to this reas^n is the custom of England: all
(...) of Justice ever have been ^eld op^nly and publicly, as appears by all
Courts in Westminster, and all Assizes an^ sessions wherein all off^nders have
open ^ryall.

Its (...) to n^ f^ld the misc^i^^s that might ensue in case an^ Court of
justice should be permi^ted, to proc^ed against any off^nder priva^^ly with
their d^o^es shut: no man should know but the Cour^ themselves, whither either
Law, or will were p^t in executi^n; wh^the^ (...) ^ccused, were gu^lty or
innoc^n^: the O^ficers o^ a (...) might exercise what (...), they might extract
(...) of C^^mes from them by terrors and to^^ures, (...) them for triuiall
^ffences: n^ ^an could t^y whetne^ c^ns^res were p^op^rtionable to their cri^es.

B^t though Sir I. Maynard deserves in my opinion re^pect and assistance, for
vindicating this Liberty of England* that all Courts of justice should be open;
yet I believe it will be found upon due examination that he was in a mistake,
i^ he suppo^ed the Lord ^o be a Court o^ Just^ce in any re^pect as to
Comm^ners: and it may be* the Lords dep^^^ment shall evi^^^ this; they w^u^d
not assume to them el^c^ the form or appear^nce of a Court of justice by
s^^^ing openly; but to proceed to the Narra^ive.

Sir John Maynard standing as a prisoner at the Ba^, the Speaker re^^manded him
to kn^el and hear his Charge. But Sir John understanding tha^ kneeling at t^ei^
Bar, either according to re^^on* or the custom* would ^ave been a (...), that
he stood as an ^f^^nder before hi^ Judges upon his tryal^, he re^u^ed to kneel
and with all humil^ty answered thu^. I am prostrate at your Lordships feet in
respect (...) Liberty of England in fr^nged viz the Lords claiming a
jurisdiction over Comme^ers, and v^ndicated by Sir Joh. Maynard.
of ^our persons, but if I should kneel to he^ an impeachine^t from th^^
H^use. I should acknowledge my ^^^fa D^li^quent under your ^urisd^^t^on and
through me, the liberties of all the Commons of ^ngland wou^^ be wen^ded and
destroyed: By the Law of the La^^* every free man ought to be tried by his
equals* and not ot^erwise; and this your Lord^^^p^ Pred^cessory confessed in
the case of Sir Simo^ ^e Be^e^ford; (...) King Ed. 3.

H^re ^^^nno ^u^ ob^erve how the Common^ of England (...) i^g^ged to Sir John
Maynard, for v^ndicating this their fundamental^ ^^berty, that the Lords have
no jurisdiction over C^mmoners: had not the Lords r^c^ived a repu^e in this
assault upon England^ (...) ^hey had taken all our liberti^s c^ptive* and the
name of (...) England might have been u^^erly abo^ish^d; (...) the (...) show
my wishes of pr^^perity to ^^r ^o^n Maynard i^ t^^s g^ll^nt (...), and t^ough I
care not trust so great a cause, upon ^e p^tron^ge (...) rude a p^n* yet I hope
the world will ^ee by m^ weak Es^ay, to prove the Lords have no jur^^d^ct^^n
over C^mmon^r^* and that a ^ull stream of reason and justice tuns on Sir John
Maynard si^e.

Now for the c^^arer u^^^rstanding thema^ter in question* I shall pre^^^e two
or t^r^e th^^gs.

First it is an (...) Maxim, that the esta^es, liberties* and fi^es of the
people o^ Englan^* ou^^t not to be dispo^ed o^^^en rary See the (...) ma^e 17.
Ca^oli printed togethe^ (...)
to the esta^l^shed Laws of the L^nd; this you shall find averre^ by the Act
made this pre^en^ Par^^^o abo^ish^ng the Star Chamber, is* that they had not
(...) themselves to the poin^s limited by the stat^ of ^. 1. H. 8. from w^^nce
they had their power, but pun^shed where no law did warrant: And that was the
reason that was rendered for the abolishing the CouncelTable* viz. That they
had determined of the Estates and liberties of the people contrary to the Law.
Now the estates of the people are disposed of contrary to law two ways, 1.
Either, when they are disposed of, or judged by persons not authorized
thereunto by Law; Or, 2. when they are disposed of by an illegal judgment,
passed by legal Judges.

So then all persons judging the Commons of England must have a juri^diction
over them by virtue o^ some Law; and who^oever submi^s to the cen^ures o^, or
try^ls by any other, becomes gui^ty of the hig^est treacher^ against Englands
freedom.

All legal ^uri^dictions over the people are either primitive or derivative
and delegate^ power by Comm^ss^on from the pr^mitive: Beware hereof confounding
jur^sdiction with the ^e^islative power: Jurisdiction 2. Premise.
be it either derived from jus and d^ctio, or as Sir Edw. Co^^e will have it
from juris (...) ^. c. the power of the law, yet its properly a declaring of
the law* or a putting laws established in execution, and does not include the
making of Laws.

Now the primitive jurisdiction is undoubtedly in the people, all just power
either legisl^tive or jurisdictive, to make or execute laws was scunded upon a
compact with them, all men being by n^^ure equal each to other, and the supreme
derivative jurisdiction resides in one or more persons, which most immediately
represent the people and are entrusted with their power. Now if any persons
should be permited to assume to themselves a jurisd^c^ion, notwithstanding all
the various jurisdictions of Courts would be con^ounded, and no security would
remain to the life or ^ib^rty of any man.

This pr^m^sed* I a^er* that the Lords have no just Commission to exerci^^ any
jurisd^ction ^ver Commoners in any case whatsoever; there is none to pass^ such
a Commission, but eit^er the people immediately, and I suppose none will plead,
that the L^rds were ever elected by the people, and a compact passed, that they
should exercise such or such juri^d^ction over them; Or, 2. such a Commission
must p^s^e from the Deputies of the People in Part* and then it must appear by
^^me Act of Part f^r which ^here is no co^ourab^e plea, as I shall presently
clear: as for the King* its indisput^ble tha^ it transcends his power to give
them a Commission ^o exe^ci^e the least juri^d^ction: The esta^es, liberties,
and lives of the people must be disposed of by Law* which i^, by Courts
estab^ished by Law, and according to the Law; and its confessed on all hands,
that the King cannot make Laws, and therefore cannot empower any with a
jurisdiction over the peo^^^ (...)

To proceed then to proofs, that such a jurisdiction was never given to the
Lords by Parl. That of M^g. Charta may suffice for all, c. 29 its said. No
Freeman shall be taken or impri^oned (...) ^^sseised of his Free hold (...)
Li^er^ies or Customs, or (...) or exi^ed* or any ways destroyed* nor we will
not passe^ on him nor c^ndemn him but by the law^ull ju^gment of hi^ (...) the
law of the Land.

B^ the jud^ment of ^is peers is h^re mea^^ ^^e verdict of 12. of his Equals,
and observe the latitude o^ this, ^ ex^ends to a^l cases whatsoever; not only
to cr^minall ca^es, but ^o a^^ ca^e^ o^ con^rover^e* about me^m ^^ tuu^* all is
co^t^^n^d under be ^^ words Free-Folds, L^berties, ^r Free-cu^tomes: whatever
any man p^ssesse its to be comprehended under the n^^^^n ^f Free ^o^d. or a
Liberty or Freehold. and yet i^ this should seem de^c^tive, ^^e n^xt word^
would supply, if we will not pass upon any man neque bimu^ n^que m^ttem^^ etc.
^aith the Latin* that is, neither the King nor any justice, or C^u^^* shall
try any ^ree m^n but by his Equals: ^o that by law, the Lords are totally
excluded from intermedling with the tryal^ of any Commoner in any case
w^at^oever.

And to his agrees the Statu^e of 25. Ed. 3. c. 4 42. Ed. ^. c 3. and there are
(...) S^a^utes in force, ^ew in print* enacted since Magra Charta which ordains
the trial of all Commoners to be by the^^ Equals on (...) and the same
Charter, and many of those Statutes particularly are confirmed by the Pe^^tion
of Right 3* Car. and by the Acts in d^ this ^re^ent Parl^ament for the
a^ol^sh^ng the Stat chamber, and (...) ^a^le, n^ the ^an^n Laws; so that
whilst those Laws re in force the Lord House is incapable to be made Judges of
any Comm^^er.

But it se^m^s this liberty of the Commons of England was sometimes invaded ^y
the Lords and Sir E. Cook 2. part of Inst. ^. p. 50, ^ai^h, that i^ was enacted
at the (...) of the Lords* that herea^ter no Peers should be droven to give
judgment on any other^ then on their Peers according to the Law and he cites
Rot. Parl. 4. E. 3, ^^. 6. 10 ma^ntaine his asser^ion, and its recorded in 4.
E. 3. Rot. 2 in Sir S^mon de Bere^^ords case, who was adjudged as an accessory
to Roger Mor^imer, in the murder of King Ed. 2 in these words.

THE PRECEDENT.
ANd it is ass^nted an^ a^r^ed by our Lord the King, and all the Gra^^ees in
(...) Pa^^^ment* that albeit the said P^^r^ as ^udges of Parliamen^ took upon

because the stat^ of Ed. 3. c ^5 conceived to be ^h^ b^sis of the Lords

the meaning of that statute.

o^ Lords be ca^^ed the Part of E^gl. or what is done by them, can be ^a^d to be
^one by Par^^am* ^ut you may observe how learned Sir Edward Coo^e, contra^^^t^
himself, when once he forsakes the rule of the Law; and now I suppose I may
conclude there is no wri^ten Law auth^rizing the Lords to take c^gnizance of
any case of Commoners whatsoever and if S^r E^: ^ooke, say true 1. part lust.
see. 19^. p. 125 that in case a ^^ry comes out of a wr^ng place or re^urned
by a wrong off^cer, and give a verdict, Judgment ^ught not to be given upon
^uch a verdict, then much better I might conclude, that all the judgment of the
Lords passed upon Commoners are ^u^l in themselves.

Objection.
But it will be yet objected that by Custom, the Lords have a juri^diction
over Commoners, and that both in cases of erro^^ous judgments, and also in
criminal cases.

Answ. 1.
There is no legal custom for their exerc^se of that juri^dict^on, To ye^d
m^^y in la^ time which cord matte be fou.
there are two things essential to a valid custom* 1. (...) 2* Time* yet that
time must be such whereof there is no r^^m^^y of man, ^as C^ok says* 1. part
d^^stit. p. 144. and the usage must be peaceable end without interruption, but
both these are wanting* for i^s within the memory of man* that the Houses were
divided and ^he^ the Lords had no such juri^diction. The Lords being a House by
themselves, was but since King Richard the first (but more pr^o^ of this in
some other trea^ise) and i^s evident by the Precedent of Sir (...) de
Ber^sfords Case, That the Lords have been interrupted in their prac^^^e of
judging Commoners.

Answ. 2.
Suppose there were custom, yet there is not the same reason, that (...)
should inves^ any with a power of jud^cature as that it should be a Title to
any liberty pertaining to a Town or an inheritance* etc. if long usurpations of
power should make the exercise thereof legal^^ the very ^ounda^i^n of just
Government were subve^^ed.

Answ. 3.
But ^ur^her, no custom that is against an act of Parliament is valid in Law*
and its proved, that the Lords exercise of jurisdiction over Commoners, is
against many Acts of Parliament* there may be fifty found con^^^ming each other.

Answ. 4.
Customs are only valid, when rea^onable* Co^k 1. part ^nstit. p. 62* See Coo^
part p. 1
that any customs how long soever it ^ath continued, if it be against reason,
its of no ^orc^ in saw* and page 56. ^e says* nothing that is contrary to
reason is consonant to law, that o^ Vlpia^^ l. 29. (...) unquestionab^^, quod
ab (...) est, etc. Course of time amends not that which was corrupt in ^^s
original. Now that the Lords jurisdiction over Commoners, ^s di^con^^nant to
equity and reason, I suppo^e Sir John Maynards Protest that follows, will
evince to mind ^ree from prejudice, yet this I shall here add.

That ^he ^aw of nature abhors the I (...) claim to a juri^d^ction over all
the people of the Land as unreasonable.

1. ^^s repugnant to the law of nature, that the judgment of the law and of the
guilt and innocence of persons should be comm^tted to any number of men,
without a di^cretion o^ (...)* or any judgment passed upon them whether they b^
capa^^e or (...) of the place of judgment and this is the case o^ the (...)
most of them at least ^it in that House* because (...) were (...) ^f Patents*
wh^c^ ^ad P^ttents for B^^onies* Ea^ldom^, etc. from the (...) and no pr^^^tion
ever made of their sutablenesse or unsut^blen^sse, and the laws of the land
seem also to (...) this, Sir Edward (...) 1 part. I^st ^ page ^ says.

If an Office either of the grant of the King or Subject which concerns the
administ^^tion proceeding, or execution o^ (...), and b^ gran^ed unto a man
that is unexp^^^, and ha^h (...) of science to execu^e the same, the grant is
m^erly void in law.

Is it not indeed irrational, that any person should be consti^ut^d a Ju^ge
over the people blind sole* before (...) poss^^le to know whether the^e will be
honesty (...) wisdom in him (...) for judgment.

^. I^s repugnant to the law of nature that any number of m^n and their
Po^^erities should be constant Judges of the guilt or innocence of wh^m they
please, or of a^l the people ^n a (...): if this were gr^nted can it be
avoided, but they mu^t be frequently ^u^ge^ and Parties and this is directly
included in the Lords claim to a juri^dicti^^ over Commoners* and expetience
gives clear test^mony to this, in Sir ^ohn Ma^^ard^ present case; for the
major part at^east of the present Hou^e of Lords subscri^ed an Engagement at
(...) heath, to join with the Army against the City in that unhappy
diff^^^nce, and yet they would be the Judges of Sir ^ohn, who they ^ay i^
guilty of treason, ringaging against them and the Army at that time.

3. I c^u^d say the written Laws of God ab^^rs the manner of the Lords claim
to a ^uri^d^ction over Common^^^, they will not submit the (...) to be ^^^yed
^y Commoners, and ^o do not to others, a^ they would the^ should do to them.

Therefore I may conclude that the common law of ^^gland, the ^nwritten and
written law of God, declares this custom ^^ll in Law.

Answ. But ^^rch^r, Custom in this case cons^sts only of many Acts of
Judicature, which the Lords have exercised over Commo^ers, and afacto ad jus
non valet argumentum, because they have usurpod a power, therefore they may
continue their usurpation, is on good Argument: Yet it may be further said,
that all their judgments passed upon Commo^ors before this present Parliament
were ^ulled by the Acts of Parliment made in 17. Car. for the abolishing the
Sta^^e-Chamber, and Counsel Table, wherein Magna Charta and the Stat. of 42.
Ed. 3. and the Petition of Right, 3. C^r. and other Statutes were confirmed,
which declare, all judgments that are passed co^ta^y to the Te^^re of Magna
Charta to be holden for ^ought, and by consequence the ^ords are de^oyd of all
pres^de^ts also for exercising a ^urisd^ction over Commo^ers, unless they
produce those made si^ce the War, wherein the voice of the Law could not be
heard for the noise of the Drum and sound of the T^^mpet.

Now from all these considerat^ons I shall presume to collect this conclusion,
that the House of Lords are ^o Court of Justice, as to the Commons of England,
that is no place where justice in any case whatsoever is to be Ministered to
them, and whoever adheres ^ot to this Gentleman in defending the L^berty of
England, and eppos^^g the ^ords in this attempt to be^eave us of our
Bi^^hright, shall never deserve in my thoughts to have his name written in an
English Chronicle: but to return to my intended Narrative.

Notwithstanding Sir John Maynards denial of the Lords Jurisdiction over him,
they would proceed, and the Speaker commanded ^ Liberty of England ^^fringed*
(...) t^ accuse a Freeman b^ way of Articles, and the L^b. maintained by Si^ ^.
M.
the Clarke to read the Charge and Sir John to kneel, and the Clark began
(...) alo^d. Articles of Impen^hment against Sir I. Maynard, etc. but Sir John
interrupted him saying. I except against the first word Articles, there is said
he but two ways for the trial of a ^^ceman for his life in England, the one
by Bill of Attainder, the other by Indictment at the Common Law, Articles are
nothing in Law, and so I am content to hear the Charge, so the word Articles
may be expunged, and the word nothing inserted, that it may be ^ead thus,
Nothing of Impeachment against Sir John Maynard, etc. then the Speaker asked
him whether he had seen the Articles, and he told them he had seen a copy of
them a month since, and that he observed that the eight Articles were the
same, mutatis muta^tis, as the French proverb says, Sell a tout th^no^, one
^^ddle for all horses. And he said further, he was persuaded that those that
drew them knew there was never a crew word in them, only a ^^eer piece of
reason of State, yet said he, all my ambition is to be tried by God, and my
Country, by a Jury of my equals at the Kings Bench-Ba^, in Pic^a Caria:
obse^ve Reade^ how faithfully Sir John adheres to the public Interest in every
particular, and note how his enemies seem to abhominate the Rules of
distribut^^e Justice, they will not afford so much Justice as a lega^l
accusation, but such Judges such an accusation: this that Sir John here claimed
is a piece of Justice so obvious to every v^lg^^ eye, that I need not say more
then was said at the Bar by him: who knows not that the Statute of 25. Ed.
^. and 4^. Ed. ^. says, ^o man shall be taken, etc. but by presentment or
indictment. etc. but I must tell Sir John that in my humble opinion he was
mistaken in ch^^, that according to the Law a Freeman should be tried b^ Bill
of A^t under, that is no ^^^ll but rather a sentence, and it is no Act of
Jurisdiction, but an Act of the Legislative, ^ower, and in my humble opinion no
sentence can be pasted against an Offender, but by some rule or Law of which
the Offender either actually had or might have had knowledge: the Law says,
invin^ible ignorance of the La^ excuse^ a toto from the whole offense; but
surely then no judgment can be passed justly upon any man by a Law that was
not in being when his supposed offense wa^ committed, in that case though the
fact were in it self evil, ye^ it were not judicially ^vill, if no Law in ^^e
Nation were extant against it, and so ^y consequence a Law to punish a person
in that case were a Law to destroy an innocent man.

And whosoever shall duly weigh the Law-giving power shall and, that the
ess^ntiall property of that power is to respect things de ^^t^ro n^n de
pr^terito, actions that are to come, not past; but more of this upon another
occasion which I now for brev^ty sake omit.

But the Lords still importuned Sir J. Ma^nard to kneel and ^^an his Charge,
and thereupon he removed from the Bar into the middle of the room, and
kneeled down and prayed God to bless the Lords and keep them from incroaching
upon (...) Liberties of the Commons of England* etc. after that he told them,
the people observed their Lordships were indulgent to their own Members, and
therefore ^e prayed them there might be no partiality, precipitation, nor
anticipation of justice.

Hereupon they commanded him to withdraw, and he was fined 9 Liberty a England
infringed by ning men without an offense, an by no rule, ^ the^^ owner
500. l. upon a pretense of a contempt of their House, observe Reader, how the
Lords proceed to devour the Commons at their pleasures, here is a Commoner
fined 500. l. for contempt. I wonder what Law defines this contempt, or who
knows of a Law against it; if there be no Law describing this pretended crime
and the penalty, then there could be no transgression not any punishment, and
being there is no Law defining such pretended crime, if the Lords may say they
are contemned when they will, and punish as they will, they may say to stand
one leg before another, or to look in their faces is contempt, and then fine a
man to the value of his whole estate, and th^n why should Englishmen arrogate
any longer the name of Freedom to themselves, let them give their (...) to the
Lords to be b^^^ed, that they may be known to be the Lords (...).

After this they called in Sir John again, and offered to condition with him,
but he told their Lordsh^ps, he would not so forget his duty, as to make
bargains with their Honors, neither would he prejudice the free people of
England in their Laws and Liberties, for all the treasure of the Kingdom, but
he would willingly sacrifice himself for the preservation of the Law. But yet
again the Clerk began to read the Impeachment, and Sir John told them, he
observed the Laws ^^n every day broken, and trampled to dirt, and he thought
it could portend nothing but slavery, and he made his obeisance, and withdrew
to the door to go out, and protested against all their proceedings as illegal
and arbitrary: thus being remanded to the Tower, he drew his Protest against
their jurisdiction over him in writing, and sent it to the Speaker in a Letter,
the copies here follow.

To the right Honorable my singular good Lord, Edward Earl of Manchester,
Speaker of the House of Peers: These.
My Lord,
YOur Lordship may please to remember I was before you at your Bar, upon the
^. Febr. last, where I demeaned my self with all duty and respect to your
honorable House, and did zealously and cordially express my self for the
just interest of your House; but being perplexed at the illegality of your
proceedings with me, I was thereby forced and compelled to protest by word of
mouth against both the matter and manner of your proceeding: but ^ooks Expos.
2^. (...). of a Char^^
in regard your Lordships were pleased to order me a new to appear at your Bar,
upon Saturday next being the 19. of Febr. 1647. I am necessitated with all
humility and respect unto the just Honor of (...) 45. 4^. (...) S^at^^ (...).
^. 37. Ed 3. ^. 3. 3. (...) Jury^^ be (...) to Magna art^, ^^ber ^egalis ho^^,
(...).
your House, enclosed to send ^ou my Plea and Protest under my Hand and Seal,
which I humbly entreat your Honor to communicate unto the House of Peers, this
being my ultimate resolution, with which I humbly subscribe my self,

My Lord, Your Honors devoted servant, John Maynard.
From the Tower of London, 14. Febr. 1647.

The humble Plea and Protest of Sir John Maynard, etc. sent unto the House of
Lords, Feb. 14. 1647.
My Lords,
I Am now aspersed with Treason, but I should really contract the guilt of
Treason against my Countries Liberty, and ^ender my Name infamous amongst the
Commons of England to posterity, if I should regard your articles of
impeachment, a^ an accusation to which I am bound to answer. If I were justly
to be suspected for Treason, there could be no Legal just proceedings to
bring me to my answer, but by ^ndictment of good and Lawful men, where such
supposed treasonable deeds were (a) d^ne; And although I were Legally ind^cted,
the Case comes not under your Lordships Cog^^^ance; but seeing I am a Commoner
of England, by the establ^^^^d Laws of the Land, my t^^all ought to be by a
Judge or Justice, and a ^ury of Commo^er^, and no (b) otherwise; and as the He
(...) to the (...) where (...). He (...). He (...)*
(...) of those Laws was, that all Trials might be equal and unpart^^^; so
they are fo^nded upon these impregnable grounds of Reason and Equity.

(...), the Jury are to be of the Neighborhood where any crime is (...), and
some ought to be of the same Hundred; for the (...), that such may have either
some cognizance of the fact, (...) some Circ^mstances thereof, or of the party
accused, wh^^^ condition and manner of conversation is much to be regarded, for
the discovering his intention in any fact supposed to be (...) or ^^lony, etc.
and the Rule of the Law is (c) A^^us non (...) rea.

2. The (...) that passes upon any Commoner one day, may themselves be in a
condition to be tried by him another day, as one of their Jury: and hereby
they are bound to indifferency and impartiality, considering it may be their
own case.

3. The party accused may challeng or except against the Jurors; other against
the (d) Array, if the Sheriff or Bayliffe impanelling the Jury, be not wholly
desingaged and indifferent, as to the Cause: and the party prosecuting, or
against the Polls; and in case of Treason he may challenge 35 peremptorily
upon his dislike, without rendering the least cause, and as many more as he can
render any reason for his just challenge, as in case he can challenge any for a
Baron or Lord of Parliament, or for defect in estate or other abilities, or for
disaffection or partiality, or for any infamous Crime, and hereby the Judges of
the fact for the party accused, may certainly be indifferent, equal and
impartial.

4. The matter of fact is only entrusted to the Jury, and the matter of Law to
the Judge, for the preverting all errors, confederacies, or partiality.

5. The Judge is sworn to do justice to all according to Law, without respect
of persons, and the Jury are sworn to find according to then evidence.

Now from every of these, the injustice and illegality of your Lordships
claim, to be both Jury and Judges in the Trial of me, or any Commoner, is
clearly demonstrable.

Your Lordships cannot be of the Neighborhood where the crimes of all
Commoners are committed, and cannot be presumed to have any cognizance of the
Facts, or parties offending; neither do you allow your selves to be tried by
Commoners, so as to be bound to indifferency and impartiality, from the
knowledge that the Commoners whom you would try, might possibly be of a Jury
for your trial in a short time; neither can my self, or any other Commoner
whom you would try, challenge in the Case of Treason thirty five of your House,
for your whole House amounts very seldom to that number; neither will you
allow me to challenge any one of your Lordships, though I should allege
disaffection, partiality, or that he is an engaged party, or prosecutor,
secretly or openly: Neither at present is there any Lord high Steward, or Lord
high Constable amongst (...), to be Judge in matter of Law, while others should
be Judges in matter of Fact: neither are your Lordships sworn to judge
according to Law, or in matter of Fact according to Evidence.

Having therefore such infallible evidence both from the Statute and
Common Law, that I ought to be brought to answer to any supposed crime* only
by indictment or presentment of my equals, good and lawful men of the
neighborhood where the fact is done, and that my trial ought to be by my
equals, and a Judge of the Law in open Court; and that the cogni^ance of any
crime whereof I am suspected, pe^taines not to your Lordships: I am resolved
never to betray my own, and all the Commoners Liberties, nor to cons^^t to the
subverting the fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, by submitting to a t^^all by
your House, or to answer to your Articles of I^p^a^hment; but I do^ hereby
protest against the form of ^^ur accusation as illegal* and your Lordships
l^^sdiction over my self, or any Commoner of England in criminal cases, as
b^ing destructive to our fundamental rights and L^berti^s: and I do^ hereby
claim the benefit of Magna Charta* the Petition of Right, and all other
established Laws of the Land, which this honorable House, the House of
Commons and the Army under his Excellency Sir Thomas Pairsax's command, in all
your and their Declarations, Remonstrances, Protestations, Oaths and Covenants
have promised, vowed, and declared, you will maintain and pres^^^.

John Maynard.


Notwithstanding this Protest, the Lords issued ^orth an Order to the
Lieutenant of the Tower, to bring Sir John to their Bar upon ^^br. ^9. and
upon the receipt of a ^^p^e thereof from the Lieutenant* Sir (...) sent this
^ns^ing Salvo to his Liberty, in p^rsuance of his Pr^test against the Lords
Jurisdiction over him.

To his honored friend C^l. Ti^hburne Lieutenant of the Tower.
Sir.
I Received a Paper from you, seeming to authorize you to carry (...) the L^rds
House, to answer to a Charge: And (...) to inform* you hereby, that my p^r^on
ought not (...) or d^s^^^bed, at the pleasure of any man. (...) obedience to
the commands of any, which are (...) therefore in ^ase you intend to dist^rb me
on (...) to see a ^^^all Warrant from some person or (...) over me ^n case of a
(...) or (...) And I m^st (...) you, that the Lords have no legal power to
summon me to answer to any crime whereof I am ^ccused or suspected; and
therefore you must expect to answer (...) whatsoever injury you offer to my
person: And know hereby, that I shall not volunta^ily go from hence to
Westminster by virtue of the Paper received, but shall only quietly suffer you
to carry me whither you piease, if you shall send force which I cannot resist.

Your Friend and Servant. John Maynard.
From my chamber in the Tower of London, Feb. 1^. 1647.

But the Lords persisted in their Order to the Lieutenant, although this was
sent to them, and debated in their House, and upon Febr. 19. Sir John was
brought to their Bar, and the Speaker pressed him urgently to kneel; but be
s^ewing them as much civil respect as could be desi^^d, refused resolvedly to
kneel; then the doo^^ being shut, the Speaker asked him whether he had brought
his Answer; he answered, he was accused of treason, and could obtain no
Counsel, and therefore desired time, that Counsel might be assigned him:
hereupon he was commanded to withdraw; but before withdrawing, he ^old the
Speaker* he hoped he should not be taken pr^co^sesse, for ^ather then so, he
would p^t in his Answer presently.

After withdrawing he was presently called in, and fourteen dai^^ time
appointed, and M. He^^e, M. Ha^es, M. Walker and M. King, appointed for his
Counsel.

Now I cannot (...) observe one desperate mischief* by this pretended Court
keeping their (...) they have caused an infamous report to be ^^^^ted abr^^d,

Treason: ^t's time to se^k for s^^ndalls ^o s^pport their (...) int^rest.

But I hope no (...) man but understands the reason of S^r John's taking time
and Counsel ^o answer: every one by Law must plead to those before whom he
(...) accused, or else he is to be taken pro (...), and j^dged accordingly: but
every one accused may plead to the Jurisdiction of the Co^rt, or to the matter
of fact, and a Plea against the Jurisdiction of the (...) put in formally*
prevents the former mischief; and therefore Sir J^^n must put in a sonmall
answer, though it be nothing b^t the substance of his Pr^test; and I bel^^ve
the Lords shall know, that the Gentleman scorns to be a Po^^tion, and betray
his Count^^ys Freedom^ into their hands.

Now Oye Commons of England, behold the foot of your ^iberties in the grave;
this Gentleman endeavors to redeem them, if you assist him not, I beseech you
consider,

1 How you may be tried for your lives in the Lords chambers, with doors shut,
if they please, that there may be no witness of their arbitrarinesse and
injustice.

2 You shall have the Lords depraved Wills, not the Laws, the rule whereby to
measure your ways, and punishments.

3 You shall be accused, without the least legality, at their pleasure, yea you
shall be judged for a newfound crime, and destroyed in your estates without
bounds or limits; yea those nerves and ligaments of the Kingdom, the Laws,
shall be cut in sunder, and what then shall any man call his own?

Now were it not that I abhor animosities* and emulations, I would compare
Sir John with L. G. Cromwell the causer of his i^peachment; I only wish, that
any admirer of that Gentleman, would discover wherein he ever maintained so
faithfully so many Liberties of England, as he has caused to be trampled in
the mire in this Case of Sir John Maynards, only to fulfill his malicious will
upon him: yea wherein has he defended so many Liberties, (notwithstanding his
large engagements at Newmarket) as the Reader may see desended and vindicated
by Sir John Maynard? and yet Sir John Maynard must be reputed a Traitor to his
Country, and he the grand Savior. I only desire that all the Commons, and all
those well-meaning Soldiers that were made L. G. Cromwells instruments to
manage his design in accusing this Gentleman; I say I only wish, that they
would judge by the fruits, and adhere to, or forsake every man, according as
they shall find him faithful or treacherous to the Kingdoms good and welfare.

FINIS.
