THE PREFACE TO THE READER.
READER, it frequently appears by the Histories of all Nations, that Military
Glory has not only taken up the Thoughts, but the Business of the most
Illustrious part of Men, in courting which they have not only spared to expose
themselves to all the hazards and dangers imaginable, but pressing on even
beyond the sense of danger, have performed, to their immortal Fame, such
Heroic Enterprises and Actions as have shaken the belief of many into the
highest degree of Incredulity, especially such as have received them upon bare
report, naked and unadorned with the many Circumstances that attended them;
wherefore I have thought it highly convenient at this juncture to restore, if
possible, their belief, by giving them a true Relation of the many famous
Battles and Sea Fights that have been fought under the leading of Emperors,
Kings, Princes, and Great Captains, the most expert of their times in Warlike
Discipline, with their various Success and Fortune. Nor may it serve less to
incite or inflame the Valiant where a Just cause offers an Invitation:
Precedents of this Nature always being attended with powerful Motives to stir
up even the Pusilanimous at least to conceive a generous esteem of great
Achievements, and kindle in Heroic Minds a restless Flame not to be
extinguished but by Death. Themistocles that Noble Grecian, whose Fame reaches
to the end of Time, having seen the Triumph of Miltiades for a Victory he had
obtained, could not (as the story of him goes) sleep, but became altogether
restless till he found Opportunity to enter upon a command wherein he became
the Bulwork and Glory of his Country; and it is reported of the Great Julius
Caesar, first Emperor of Rome, that whilst he was but in a low Station, seeing
the Statue of Alexander the great, and being sensible what vast Kingdoms and
Countries that Monarch had subdued and brought under his Subjection in a short
spaoe, he wept, because being equal to him in years, himself had not arrived at
his Perfection, and thereupon ceased not till he made almost all the then known
World at his Devotion; nor of this kind is he, who was truly styled the delight
of Mankind, and the Honor of our English Nation, the wise and valiant Sir
Philip Sidney to be omitted, who reports of himself, That hearing the Ballad of
the fight between the Earls Piercy and Dowglass sung but by a common Chanter,
it raised in him such a desire of Martial Enterprises, that he from that time
coveted nothing more than to signalize his Valor in the Field, which afterward
became to his immortal Fame the wonder of the Christian World. Nor does this
Treatise consist only of Battles, etc. but of the Policies, Stratagems, and
Practices of the most Expert and Renowned Generals and Captains, whereby they
secured themselves in a retreat, circumvented the Enemy, or obtained the
Victory; To which a Scheme of Military Behavior is added, etc. with the most
material matters and things appertaining to Engenry, especially as to what
relates to Gunnery and Artificial Fire works, etc. with somewhat that refers to
Fortification; by which even the unlearned may have an insight into that great
and curious Art and Mystery, and be made sensible at once of the danger and
advantage that attend^ it; which insight, if it be his fortune to seek for
Honor in the Field, etc. may greatly profit the Reader; or if otherwise, he
will at least get this advantage by it, to know in his Retirement what other^
have sought for not without effusion of Blood, through innumerable hazards and
dangers. And so hoping it will prove advantageous, not being perverted to a
sinister end, I humbly take leave to subscribe my self,

Reader, Your devoted Friend and Servant, J. S.

A POEM Recommended to the Reader, upon the Perusal of the Book entitled The
Soldiers Companion, etc.
By a Person of Quality.
IF Fame and Martial Glory you affect,
(Reader) what more than's here can you expect;
Or if you would know what in days past was done^
This Book informs you how much Fame was won;
How by their Valor Heroes got Renown,
How never-fading Laurels wreathed their Crown;
And rising Monarchs grasped a lasting Throne,
Or won vast kingdoms to augment their own.
How Nations felt a sudden change of State,
And Fortune's treacherous smiles perceived too late
How Princes set in Blood, how Armies fell,
How Plains with might heaps of Ruin swell;
How Rivers with a Crimson Torrent rise,
How the Victors shouts, and how the vanquish'd's cries.
Pierce thinner Air, and rend the blushing Skies.
How clashing Arms a horrid discord bray,
And Earth-born Thunders cloud the Lamp of day,
How Iron Globes with Death pave all their way,
Whilst angry Vollies bellowed over the Plain,
And made it seem but one great Field of Flame,
Here you may count the number of the slain;
Or see the yielding Soldier on his Knee
Begging for Life, from's enraged Enemy;
See others nobly bold, maintain a fight,
And in despair to conquer, take delight
More in a noble death, than slavish flight.
See those in rout cast every way their Arms,
Whilst hot pursuit their rear with slaughter storms:
Sad sights you will say, but he who War will court,
Must steel his Heart, and think the Danger Sport;
Yet safely you may sit and view a Sceen
That fatal has to bleeding Nations been:
Nor is this all, in it more things you will find
That may more please a weak and tender mind,
Though it for Heroes chiefly was designed.
With Magic Flame it treats the God of War,
And new created Fires adds to his Star.
THE Soldiers Companion, etc.
The Relation of the Great and Memorable Battle fought in Battle Field in
Sussex, between Harrold King of England and William Duke of Normandy, on October.
14. 1066.
KING Harrold having no sooner defeated the Army of Norvigians and Danes in the
North with exceeding slaughter, (in which, of note fell Harfagar King of
Denmark, Tosto his Brother, and Olave his Son) but News was brought him that
the Normans, under the leading of their Duke, were landed in the South;
whereupon he made such speed with his Army, that before they could pass through
the County of Sussex, he was drawing out of London, and so with the like
celerity marched to give them battle, after having sent back the Messenger who
came from the Duke of Normandy to demand possession of the Kingdom, by virtue
of a promise he had made him, when being a private man, he was taken Prisoner
upon his Coast; so that both Armies pitching their Tents upon a great Plain,
now known by the name of Battel-field, the King sent diverse Spies to view the
Norman Camp, who being taken and presented to the Duke, he generously feasted
them, causing them to be carried from Tent to Tent, and then they were
dismissed without any damage or detriment. And now Duke William a second time
sending to demand the Kingdom, or a single Combat with King Harrold, and both
of them being refused, as also another proffer, which was to hold the Kingdom
as a Feudetary of Normandy; the Armies drew out on the 14th of October 1066 to
try the Fortune of a King and Kingdom by more Swords than one, when being set
in array of Battle, and encouraged on either side with moving Orations, the
bloody Blast was sounded, and the Kentish Men, who claimed the Avaunt-guard or
From of the Battle as their Right, moved and charged the Enemy in the Front
with great fury, the Battalions and Wings of Horse on the other parts doing the
like, yet keeping firm in their thick and closed Ranks, so that what with the
shot of Arrows and those that came to the Sword and push of Pike, a bloody and
doubtful Fight ensued; nor could the Normans with the continual wheeling of
their Horse, and shot of Archers, of which they mostly consisted, dismay or
disorder the English Battle, tho^ in their motions they shot a slaunt in the
Air, that the Arrows in their fall might disable the inmost Ranks and gaul the
Horse; which the Duke perceiving, and finding that unless he could loosen the
Battle it was in vain for him to expect the Victory; (nor had he any hope of
return, his Fleet being before fired at his command) he ordered the Retreat to
be sounded, but ^n such a manner, that the whole Army consisting of 50000 Horse
and Foot might suddenly face about and charge at the Signal appointed to be
given; which Stratagem answered his Expectation, for the English supposing the
Normans fled, sudden^y disranked to pursue them, so that their Orders being
open, and the Duke rallying (...) is Men, broke in with a furious Charge, and
made such slaughter that the ground was covered with heaps of the slain, nor
^ould the King though he labored to cast ^^em into a thick Body restore the
Battle; ^ut as he was intent upon it, he received the ^ot of an Arrow which
entered his Brain, and of which Wound he fell down dead ^ter which a miserable
slaughter ensued, ^ough a party of the English cast themselves into a Ring and
manfully resisted; however, being in the end routed on all parts, there fell
97974 by the Sword and shot of Arrows, amongst which were the King and his two
Brothers Leosin and Grith, together with the flower of the English Nobility,
and of the Normans not above 9000, and although their Duke escaped, he had
three Horses slain under him, yet by this Battle so gained he won a Kingdom,
for the Land being thus deprived of her King and Nobles, no farther resistance
was made, but all things were left to the disposal of the Conqueror, who soon
after caused himself to be Crowned King, and is known in our Cronologies by the
style o^ King William the First, or William the Conqueror.

Thus Normans fierce possessed our fruitful Soil,
And stained with blood the famous British Isle.
Speed de vitae W. C. The Battles of Jerusalem, or Jerusalem no^ by the Armies
of the Western Princes, December 25. 1099.
JErusalem being in the hands of the Infidels, their unheard of Cruelties
loudened the cries of the oppressed Christians, an^ obliged them to importune
their Patriarch to implore the Christian Princes to send their Armies by Battle
to rescue them from their Oppressors, who accordingly sending his Letters full
of lamentations, by one Peter a Hermit, with other proofs and attestations of
the miseries they suffered in the Holy Land, such credit was given to them,
that in a short time an Army of 300000 men were raised, wearing on their
Breasts red Crosses in token of their holy Warfare, and were chiefly under the
leading of Godfry of Bulloin, Duke of Lorrain, and his two Brothers Eustace and
Baldwin, Hugh brother to the French King, Raymond and Robert Earls of Flanders,
Robert Duke of Normandy, Son to William the Conqueror, Stephen de Valois Earl
of Chartires, Adimer Bishop of Podolia, etc. and with this Army they passed the
Hellespont, covering the shores of Asia, and brought a great Terror upon the
Infidels, who gathered what Forces they could to oppose the progress of such a
War, and were not altogether unsuccessful, for Peter the Hermit advancing
before the rest of the Army with 40000 men, raised in the Territories of the
Church, being furiously charged by the Enemy, lost the greatest part of his
Forces, and was obliged to retire with the rest to Civite, a Town a little
before abandoned by the Turks, not daring to depart thence till the arrival of
Duke Godfry, when with their united Forces the Christians marched to the City
of Nicea, which they besieged, and made themselves Masters of it in fifty days,
finding therein great Riches, and many Persons of note; amongst whom were the
Turkish King Solyman's Wife and two Children: and the King who came to the
Relief of it, with the whole power of the lesser Asia, consisting of 60000
Horse and Foot, was overthrown, with such slaughter as covered the Fields with
the dead Bodies, and filled the Ditches with blood, nothing being to be heard
but cries and dying groans, for the Christians following the Execution, 40000 of
the Infidels fell by the Sword, which brought such a Terror upon those Parts,
that Cities and Towns were abandoned without so much as being disputed; Antioch
only of all in that large Tract held out, yet made but a weak resistance, for
after a furious Assault it was taken; which being known to the Garrisons of
Iconium and Haraclea, they surrendered upon the first summons, still flying
before the Victors, and daily sending to his Cozen Axan, the Persian Sultan,
for Aid; but he not being able to supply him against such powerful Opponents,
the Christians recovered all that had by the Infidels been torn from the Greek
Empire, and then in a full Council of the Princes, agreed that an Oath should
be administered to each individual Person, that none should return till
Jerusalem was taken, which as well the Officers as Soldiers joyfully embraced,
and so the Army passed over the River Orontes, forcing their way with shot of
Arrows through the Turks that guarded the further banks, and took the other
Antioch in Surrya on the third day of June, Anno 1098, and repulsed with great
slaughter an Army of 100000 Horse and Foot that came to relieve it, killing
20000 of them upon the place, which made Corbanus the Persian Sultans
Lieutenant raise his Siege from before Edassa, and haste to oppose the progress
of their Arms; but joining battle, after a furious and obstinate fight, he was
overthrown with almost incredible slaughter of his men; so that the Valleys
were filled in a manner with Blood, and the Bodies of 100000 slain, the
Christians not losing above 4000 in this Enterprise; and the next day took 5000
Camels richly laden; and thus conquering on, and taking all the Cities in their
way, they came to Jerusalem, at the sight of which they raised such a shout as
made the Country resound with joyful Acclamations, when with Hands and Eyes
extended toward Heaven, they called upon the Name of Jesus, and many of them
in respect to the place where our Blessed Savior had preached his Gospel, fell
on their Knees and kissed the Ground, making fresh Vows never to leave the City
till they had wrested it out of the hands of the Infidels; and thereupon,
although their strength was much impaired by sickness, as well as frequent
fights and skirmishes, it was resolved in a Council of Princes, not to defer
the siege, although they knew the Governor upon the approach of the Christian
Army had increased his Garrison, and provided necessaries to enable him the
better to defend the City, and make a resolute resistance; so that on Christmas
day they sat down before it on the North side; for toward the East and West
the Quars, broken Rocks, and shattered Hills forbad them access, or at least,
rendered any approach on those parts very difficult and incommodious, the order
of the incampment being in this manner. viz.

Next to the Wall encamped Godfrey of Bulloin Duke of Lorrain, with his
Lorrainers and Germans; next him on the right, Robert Duke of Normandy, Son to
the Conqueror, and the Earl of Flanders pitched their Tents: and over against
the West Gate were allotted the Stations of Tancred, and the Earl of Tholous,
Bohemund and Baldwin being then absent, the one remaining King at Antioch, and
the other Governor at Edassa; and so having refreshed themselves, it was
concluded among the Princes, that on the fifth day of January the Assault
should be given, which was accordingly performed with much bravery and
resolution; nor were the Turks, Jews, and Sarazens wanting to make an obstinate
defense, though as they stood to it upon the Walls and Towers, they were
miserably overwhelmed by showers of Arrows, so that some thousands were lost on
either side, for the Christians wanting scaling Ladders to ascend, at what time
the Archers caused the besieged to give back, and the Weather being exceeding
hot, the Generals thought fit at that time to sound the retreat, upon which the
Soldiers, who at the utmost hazard were desirous of nothing more than winning
the City, unwillingly retired; yet that the besieged might have littlerest, on
the tenth day of January another fierce assault was given, which being managed
with the Engines of War, made the Walls tremble, nothing therein being omitted
that Policy or true Valor could afford; yet this as the former, through the
excessive heat of the Weather, and want of Water, took not its desired effect;
for before the arrival of the Christians, the Infidels having poisoned all the
Wells about the City, or stopped them up, they could not be easily discovered;
so that none but that of Siloe, which had worked out the Poison, and was become
wholesome, yielded them any relief, and that yielded the Army not half enough,
through the defeat of which they suffered great Extremity; yet armed with a
Christian Courage and Patience, they endured it without the least repining; and
soon after were recruited by a Fleet of Genoess; who arriving at Joppa, sunk
their Galleys for fear of being taken, and marching over land, arrived safe at
the Camp, where, as expert Engineers, they became very serviceable, in making
Engines for assault, and moving Towers, with flying Bridges covered with raw
Hides to prevent their being fired, for from these the Christians upon equal
terms fought hand to hand with those that kept the Walls and Bulwarks, these
Towers overlooking even their highest Battlements; so that now all things being
in a readiness for a third general assault, whilst the besieged were preparing
to fire the Towers, the Wind by a sudden Providence drove back the Flames with
such fury, that many of those that kept the Walls were stifled, and others
forced to retreat; of which, Godfrey duke of Lorrain taking the advantage,
mounted the Engine, and being supported by others, leaped upon the Wall, and
there fixing his standards, defended it in spite of all the resistance that was
made, continuing there fighting with his drawn Sword amongst a shower of
Arrows, till such time as his venturous attempt encouraged the rest of the
Princes to hasten to his Relief, who pressing on with great fury, a terrible
slaughter ensued, the Soldiers in their Rage not sparing Man, Woman, or Child,
that they found in the first heat of their entrance, which made the most
courageous of the Turks, Sarazens, and Jews, after an obstinate fight of two
hours, to retire into Solomon's Temple; in the entrance of which they
desperately disputed it till thousands of dead bodies covered the place, and
all the Pavements were slipery and overflowed with Blood: And in this fight
were the Christians so eager in rushing on, that those who pressed to get
forward, pushed many of their Fellows who were before them, upon the Enemies
Weapons; yet the slaughter increasing, and the Infidels finding the City
irreparably lost, gave back, and in an obstinate mood betook themselves to the
vaulted Roofs of the Temple, where, with such Weapons as they had, they
defended themselves till the fury of the Christians was over, and a Trumpet by
the command of the Princes sounded as the signal of giving Quarter, at what
time they yielded, and had their Lives spared.

Thus was the famous City of Jerusalem retaken by the Christians in thirty
days, Anno 1099, after it had been in the hands of the Infidels for the space
of 409 years, and so great was the joy conceived by the Christians who
inhabited it, and had suffered so many Cruelties under the Turkish Governors,
that with tears of Joy they embraced the Soldiers every where singing Praises
for their Deliverance. And now a King being wanting, that good Order might be
maintained, the Princes in full Assembly proposed that Honor to Robert Duke of
Normandy, but he having notice of his Brothers death declined it, as being
desirous to return and take possession of his Kingdom of England, though he
afterward found it prepossessed by his younger Brother Henry; nor long was it
e're he deprived him of his Duchy of Normandy, and finally of his life by
putting out his Eyes, which many attributed as a Judgment for refusing the
proffer^d Scepter of Jerusalem; but upon this refusal Godfry of Bulloin Duke of
Lorrain was unanimously chosen King, yet refused to be crowned with a golden
Crown where his Savior for the Salvation of Mankind had sometimes worn a Crown
of Thorns. And although an Army of an 100000 Turks and Sarazens advanced to
recover the City, yet the Princes drawing out their strength, gave them Battle
with so fearful an overthrow, that all the Hills and Plains for the space of
nine miles were covered with the bodies of the slain: and so Jerusalem (with
other exceeding large Territories) continued in the Possession of the European
Christians, during the Reign of nine Kings, and for the space of an 100 Years,
when through their own Dissentions it was lost to Salladine the Sultan of
Egypt.

Thus Fame and Piety drew Arms from far,
And made proud Asia reel with heavy War,
Whilst Christian Faith's regrafted on the stem
Where it first flourished (great Jerusalem)
Whilst Jacob's Heritage, the Promised Land,
Does find her Scepter in a Christian hand.
A Description of the Famous Battle fought near Cressy, between the English
under the Leading of Edward the Black Prince, and the French, under the Leading
of Philip their King, etc.
KING Edward the third of England, having in the right of his Mother laid claim
to the Crown of France, and the French opposing to it their Salique Law, by
which the Heirs Female are disabled from governing, he raised a powerful Army,
to gain by the Sword that Right which was denied him by a pretended Law, made
to exclude the Daughters of France, etc. taking upon him the Title of King of
France, Quartering the Arms of that Kingdom with those of England, which have
so continued from that day; and landing in the North parts, he wasted the
Country with Fire and Sword as far as Turwin, defeating such Forces as came to
oppose him, and reduced many Towns to his Obedience, soon after destroying
their Fleet of 400 Sail of Ships, and in it 30000 men, (many of them of the
prime Nobility;) but still being refused to be invested in the possession of
the Kingdom, having refreshed himself in England, and settled his Affairs,
levied an Army of 32500 Horse and Foot, with which he repassed the Seas, and
brought such a terror upon the French, that many great Towns were abandoned
without resistance, which obliged Philip the French King to raise the whole
power of his Country, consisting of 100000 Horse and Foot, the Flower of
France, etc. and with them advanced by hasty marches to give the English
battle, or to oblige them to retire; of which King Edward having notice by his
Espials, caused his Horsemen to quit their Horses, and marshaled his Army on
foot in three Battalions, the chief of which himself retained as a reserve,
mostly composed of men at Arms; and the other two under the leading of the
Black Prince, his Son, and diverse Nobles, he caused to advance into the Plain;
where the French coming on with great Fury, as not expecting but to obtain the
Victory, were received in the front by the Avaunt-guard of the Men at Arms,
whilst the wings of Archers sent showers of Arrows amongst them, which gauling
their squadrons of Horse in the flank, put them into great disorder; at which
the French Commanders of the Horse growing impatient, broke through their own
foot, and made a strong effort upon the Princes Battle, by continually pressing
on with fresh men, which made the Lords who guarded the Prince, send to the
King, entreating him to advance with his battle to their Succor, To which he
returned answer, That he designed the Glory of the day to his Son, and that
whilst he was alive, they must not expect any Succor from him, but fight
valiantly to win Honor and Renown; which Answer so animated the English, that
they fought more desperate than ever, insomuch that the French Horse being in
confusion by the goaring of Pikes, and the shot of Arrows, and the Foot not
able to relieve them, the men at Arms brake in with such fury, and in a firm
battle piercing their squadrons, that they could find no place of retreat or
rally, so that the other Battalion charging in the flank, and the Archers still
delivering their Arrows with great Celerity, Victory declared on the part of
the English, whilst nothing but flight and slaughter ensued on the part of the
French, insomuch that in six hours space the field was heaped with the bodies
of the slain, and nothing was heard so loud as the Cries of the dying men,
whilst happy was he that could escape the Swords of his fierce Pursuers.

In this battle were slain the Kings of Navar, and Bohemia, two Princes of the
blood, seven Earls, and 15000 Barons, Knights, and men at Arms, with not less
than 30000 of-lesser note, besides a great number taken Prisoners, and many of
those of the first rank, which were afterward put to their ransoms. The battle
being entirely won, the King and Prince marched to Calais, and besieged it,
when as the Governor having capitulated for some time, and the attempts to
relieve it proving unsuccessful, he surrendered it to the King, who placed an
English Colony therein; and whilst this War lasted, David King of Scotland,
taking part with the French, and invading England in the absence of the King,
was defeated near Durham, and himself taken Prisoner by one Copland, most of
his Army being slain, and was after eleven years imprisonment redeemed at
100000 Marks; nor was Prince Edward less victorious in a second battle fought
between him and John the French King, Son to the forementioned Philip, who came
against him with 100000 Horse and Foot, or as some will have it 130000, in
which battle fought near Po^tus, there were slain fifty two Noble men, most of
them Dukes and Earls, 1700 Knights and Esquires, and 16000 common Soldiers;
the King himself, together with Philip the Dauphin, one Archbishop, ten Earls,
and about 200 Knights and Esquires were taken Prisoners, besides a great number
of lesser note, though here the French were three to one in the Field.

Thus England's Ancient Glory raised by Arms,
The World through Fame's loud breathing Trumpet charms:
And this Memorial through all Lands does spread,
That no Land has more valiant Hero 's bred.
A Relation of the fatal Battle fought on the Plains of Cossovia, between
Amurath the first, King of the Turks, and the Despot of Servia, in League with
diverse other Christian Princes, Anno 1390.
THE Turkish Kingdom, founded by Othoman in Asia, having spread it self in a
short time over the Hellespont into Europe, and their Arms brought a Terror
upon the Greek Empire, now sick and languishing, by reason of intestine broils;
to prevent the further incroachment of Amurath, the Despot, or Prince of
Servia, made a private League with the King of Bosna, that with their united
Powers they might defend their Territories; which was not yet so secretly done
at an interview between them, but the Turk had notice of it; and having
overthrown Aladin the Caramanian King in Asia, and stripped him out of his
Countries, he drew all his Forces into Europe, to oppose the Princes, who were
raising what Power they could to march against him, and knowing they had to
deal with one of a fierce and cruel nature, resolved to try what might be done
by stratagem; in order to which, a Captain that kept a Castle on the Confines
of Bosna, hasting to the Camp of Amurath, promised him for a large Reward no
put the greater part of the strong holds into his hands, if he would follow his
directions, confirming him in what he said by many specious Pretenses and
Protestations, insomuch that the covetous Turk credited him so far as to send
20000 men under the leading of his Tutor Lala-Schahin, which the Captain
suffering for a while to plunder some inconsiderable Places, to give them
thereby the greater confidence of their security; in the end he trained them
into an Ambush of 30000 Besniacks, who as they were straggling, fell upon them,
and cut off 15000 of them, the other 5000 with Schahin hardly escaping to make
a relation of their welcome.

Amurath being not a little grieved and vexed at the misfortune and disgrace
put upon him by one in whom he thought he might have confided, considering the
Rewards he had bestowed to engage him on his part, breathed nothing but Revenge
against the Christians, and in the height of his fury commanded his Army to
march into Servia, where, somewhat contrary to his Expectation, he found the
Christians with a formidable Army ready to bid him battle, when as some
inconsiderable Towns being taken and possessed on both parts, and the dreadful
day of battle drawing nigh, the Armies, as if by consent, met upon the large
Plains of Cossovia, where the Generals and Great Captains on either side having
made many Speeches and moving Orations to animate the Soldiers to try their
utmost Power and Force, and set them in battle array, the charge was founded,
and the battalions joined with such fury, that the Earth trembled under their
Feet, and such was the horrid clashing of Arms, the noise and shouts of the
Conquerors, the Groans and Cries of the vanquished, and the neighing and
trampling of Horses, that many report the wild Beasts in the Mountains stood
trembling at what it might signify, or whence so great a Clamor proceeded,
and that such as beheld the fight at a distance, imagined the showers of Arrows
that darkened the Plains, descended from the Clouds; and so furiously the Despot
to revenge the mischiefs the Turks had done in his Country, charged upon the
right wing, that he broke and disordered it, and pierced the main battle: But
the Turks being double the number of the Christians, and Bajazet, Amurath s
Son, coming in with twenty thousand Horse, restored the battle, so that the
Christians being wearied with slaughtering their Enemies, and having done all
that could be expected from true Valor for the space of eight hours, for so
long the battle lasted, they were at length overset and put to the worse in all
parts, and the Plains were made mountainous with the heaps of the slain, so
that they in some measure hindered the pursuit, though the Christians, like men,
desperately resolved to conquer or dye, fled not till Lazarus the Despot, and
all the great Captains were killed, valiantly fighting, or whilst there was any
hopes of Victory, or of an honorable Retreat; Those that fell in this battle
on both sides not being accounted less than 50000. But of this Victory Amurath
had but small joy, for whilst he was glutting his Eyes with the vast heaps of
the slain, a Christian Soldier named Cobelites, half dead and faint with
Wounds and loss of Blood, rising as it were from a Golgotha, or Grave, came
staggering toward him, falling two or three times in twenty paces, whilst
those that were about him would have hindered his approach, but Amurath forbad
them to hinder him, as supposing he came to petition for Life, when on the
contrary, without a word speaking, suddenly drawing out a Dagger, he stabbed
him into the Belly, for which he was hewn in pieces by those that attended
their King, who likewise died of that wound soon after; and for this Reason the
Turks, when any one is admitted to his Audience of the Emperor, lead him by
either Arm, etc.

Thus were Cossova's Plains made fat with Blood,
And Death was glutted with a Crimson Flood.
The tot'ring State of Christendom found there
A fatal Scar which still she is forced to wear.
A Description of the Memorable Battle fought on the Plains of Sennas in Asia,
between Tamerlane the Great, Prince of the Tartars, and Bajazet, the First of
that Name, King of the Turks, etc.
BAjazet succeeding Amurath, who was killed on the Plains of Cossovia, not only
prosecuting his Wars against the Christians, but stripping the Mohammedan
Princes out of their Dominions in the lesser Asia, and they hearing of
Tamerlane's Conquests in the great Kingdom of China, where he had wrought
Wonders, and of his Power with the Tartarian Emperor, whose Daughter he had
married, many of them fled to him for Refuge, imploring him by Arms to restore
them to their just Rights that had been wrongfully taken from them; which so
far prevailed with him, being at the same time solicited by Emanuel the Greek
Emperor, whom Bajazet had besieged in Constantinople, the chief City of his
Empire, as to send Ambassadors to the Turk with Presents on their behalf,
requiring him to cease from molesting his Allies, and more especially so worthy
a Person as the Greek Emperor had been represented to him to be; but instead
of answering his Expectations, Bajazet in a proud manner not only rejected his
Presents, but in opprobrious Terms made him many foul Reproaches, telling his
Ambassadors, He desired nothing more than to meet him in the Field; and so
dismissed them with Threats and Scorn, which so enraged the Tartar, that being
before persuaded by Axalla his great Favorite, a Genoa by Birth, and by
Profession a Christian (and having an Inclination to assist the Christian
Emperor, whose Opinion he favored) to raise an Army, he now resolved to do
it, and such an Army as should cover the Countries he passed through, which he
soon did in those vast Dominions; and taking leave of his Father-in-Law and his
Wife, passing the Mountains, marched through diverse Countries, drawing a World
of People after him, none daring oppose or attempt to hinder his Passage; when
at Bachichich he mustered his Forces, and found them to consist of 800000 Horse
and Foot of diverse Nations, and there he gave them general Pay, not having
suffered any of them to do the least Outrage or Injury to the People or their
Goods through the Country they had passed. The News of whose Approach coming to
Bajazet as he lay at the Siege of Constantinople, he rise, and with his whole
Power passed into Asia, happily as the Tarter wished, who would have been
otherwise much put to it for Convenience to transport so great an Army, nor had
Bajazet failed with a small Fleet to have prevented it. However, whilst
Tamerlane was passing the Euphrates, and taking the great City of Sabastia,
Bajazet joined his Lieutenant in Asia; so that their united Forces made no less
than 500000 effectual men, when meeting with the Governor o^ Sabastia, whom
Tamerlane had sent to acquaint him with the Subversion of that City; he
demanded which was the greater Army, he having seen both, to which after
craving pardon, if speaking according to his Judgment he should offend, That
doubtless Tamerlane's must needs be the greatest, seeing he was Lord of far
greater Countries; at which Bajazet laughing, said to those that stood by, Out
of doubt the sight of the Tartars have made this Coward so afraid, that he
believes every one to be two.

The Armies by this time being come within sight of each other upon the large
Plains of Sennas, it was not thought by either General convenient to join
Battle that Evening, by reason the Day was far spent, but to stand upon their
Guard till the next Morning, though several Skirmishes passed between the
Turkish Avaunt-guard and the Parthean Horsemen, in which a Turkish Officer
being taken and carried before Tamerlane, he caused him to be dismissed, with a
Command to tell his Master, That now he was come to meet him in the Field as he
had desired, and that he might the better know him, he should find him fighting
under the Green Standard. The Morning being come, and either Army standing in
Battel-array, the charge was sounded, whereupon the Wings began to move with
great speed, whilst the Prince of Ciracan, Tamerlain's Lieutenant and Kinsman,
with 40000 Horse gathered in Parthia and Media, charging the Avaunt-guard with
great fury, pierced the main battle, and put the Janissaries into disorder. But
the Prince entering too far amongst their Ranks was slain, and his squadron in
the end over-borne; whereupon Axalla with his squadron, composed of Sciths and
Parthians, with such fury charged the Turks left Wing, that cutting down all
that opposed him, he stopped not till he faced the Battalion of the Janissaries,
at what time the footmen came to join him; yet so valiantly did the Janissaries
stand to their Arms, in the middle of whom was the Person of their King, that
the fight continued bloody and doubtful for the space of an hour or more, all
the place being paved with dead Men and Horses; till the Tartars overcharged,
gave ground, which Tamerlain perceiving, sent 10000 Horse to reinforce them and
other 10000 to fight in the Rear ward whilst his footmen fell on with the Turk
main battle that was as yet unshaken; and forcing their way, opened a Passage
to the Rear-ward of the Janissaries, who sustaine^ their charge for a
considerable time; bu^ being in the end overpowered by number they were
obliged to give ground; when Tamerlain coming on with a Reserve of 50000 fresh
Horse, and charging through the Horsemen that covered the main battle of the
Turks, and the Footmen already wearied and tired out, making but weak
resistance, many of their prime Commanders being slain, they were on all sides
miserably beaten down by the Horsemen; who with their Maces, Poll-axes and
Scimiters, entering their Ranks, made great slaughter; so that losing Courage
and Power to resist, they betook themselves to flight: and amongst them Bajazet
wounded in his endeavoring to restore the battle, who, together with his Son
Musa, fell into the hands of Axalla, as also did the Despot of Servia, who were
presented to Tamerlain. Nor is it held by many, thar had not the Subjects of
the Mohammedan princes pressed to the War ^n diverse parts of Asia the less,
perceived their natural Lords under the Tartars Ban^er, and in the heat of the
fight gone over ^o them, the Victory had gone with the Turks. However, in this
fight, which lasted ^om seven in the Morning till four in the Evening, 80000
Tartars, and 120000 Turks ^re computed to be slain; and amongst the ^ormer, of
note only the Prince of Ciracan, who was slain at the beginning of the fight;
and amongst the latter, Mustapha, Bajazets eldest Son, with diverse Bassa's, and
the Ag^ of the Janissaries. And it is further confirmed, that when Bajazet
(being a Prisoner was brought before Tamerlane, that he aske^ him the reason
that moved him to War again^ so noble a Prince as the Greek Emperor, without
any cause given, to which he replied Even the same Cause that moved you to
inva^ me, viz. The desire of Glory and Sovereigm^ And why, said the Tartar
Prince, do you (...) such Tyranny over those you Conquer, with respect of Sex
or Age: That did I, said h^ to give the greater Terror to my Enemies. A^ Ah,
continued Tamerlane, What would y^ have done with me if it had been your Fort^^
to have had me in your Power? I would sa^ Bajazet, boldly replying, as not
conque^^ though overcome, Have put you in an I^^ Cage, and as a Trophy of my
victory, h^^ carried you throughout my Dominions. The said Tamerlane, It is but
just that I serve (...) in the like kind; and thereupon comma^^ing him out of
his Presence, a cage by (...) Order was made for him, in which he continued
till in a desperate Mood he beat (...) Brains out against the Bars of it. And
(...) though Tamerlain pursuing this Victor^^ won all that which the Turks held
in (...) rope, and most of that in Asia; yet he dy^^ Mahomet, Bajazets Son,
recovered it in few years by Policy and Force.

Thus we behold how fickle Fortunes Wheel
Plays Tricks with mighty Ones, and lets them feel.
How soon from the top of Empire she can thrust
Monarchs, and lay their Glory in the Dust.
A Description of the Battle of Azin-Court, sought in France between Henry the
Fifth, King of England, etc. and the Dolphin of France, etc. on the Plains near
Azin-Court, etc.
KING Henry the Fifth coming to the Crown after the Death of Henry the Fourth,
his Father, and being of a Martial Spirit, began to consider how by some great
Exploit he might leave a Name; and thereupon considering that Normandy, Guien,
Aquitain, and Anjou, were the rightful Inheritances of the Kings of England,
and had without any just Cause been wrested from his Predecessors during the
Intestine Troubles of this Kingdom, he sent Ambassadors to Charles the French
King, to demand them, but not only being denied it, but some Affronts put upon
him, he sent Antelop his Pursuvant at Arms, with Letters of defiance; and
having discovered and escaped a Conspiracy against his Life, laid by the
Contrivance of the French, who had promised several of his Nobles a Million of
Gold to effect his Death, he embarked with his Army for France, and landed at
Harflew in Normandy, where he had Bordeaux, and many Towns of Note put into his
Hands, in which he left Garrisons, and placed in them English Artizens with
small Resistance, which made him resolve to pass through the Countries of Caux
and Ewe, to his Town of Calais, though his Army consisted of no more than 13000
Foot, and 2000 Horse, and so set forward with easy Marches, the Country in his
way being all destroyed before him; for the French having notice of what he
intended, had not only removed the Forage and Provisions, but destroyed and
brake down the Bridges, felled Trees, and plashed Woods in the way he was to
take, raising in the mean time great Forces in all parts of the Country, as not
doubting but they had him and his Army at their Pleasure; and indeed for want
of Necessaries, and by reason of the Difficulties the Soldiers were forced to
struggle with, many o^ them in a short time became sick and infirm; so that the
King finding himself in a strait, began to repent him that he had so far
advanced into the Enemies Country, as knowing should he now retreat, he must
fight his way; wherefore he made some Overtures to the French Generals,
proposing to surrender several Towns he had taken in Normandy, but they
rejected these Propositions with Derision, as not doubting but himself and them
together, with his small Army, wherein were many of the English Nobility, would
be at their disposal; and so confident were they herein, that the three
Generals, viz. The Dolphin, the Dukes of Burgundia and Orleans had conditioned
and agreed amongst themselves for the Prisoners and Spoils, and with their huge
Army, consisting of 150000. Horse, and 10000 Foot, (many of the former being
the Nobility and Gentry of the Kingdom, who hoped to win Honor in such, as
they thought it, an assured Enterprise;) they advanced apace; so that King
Henry, a Man of an undaunted Courage, seeing no way but to fight, disposed his
Army to the best Advantage, placing in the front a competent number of Archers,
who carried beside their Bows and Swords, long Stakes pointed with Iron, to fix
in the Ground slauntwise, that when they retired, they might secure them
against the Horse. And in a Meddow with a convenient Ditch to defend it, he
placed as in an Amubush, five hundred Archers, who lay within half shot of the
French Wing, whilst in the main Battle stood the men at Arms, and the Horse
divided into two Squadrons, were to charge as advantage gave them Opportunity.
And now whilst the French, who covered the Country, were advancing in three
main Battles as to assured Victory, the King with a moving Oration exhorted his
Captains and Soldiers, For the Honor of their Country, and their own safety,
not to faint, but stand to it manfully; and confiding in the justness of their
Cause, not to despair of Victory: nor should for his part, let France see him a
Captive, or England be put to the Charge of his Ransom, as being resolved to
dye with Honor, if things came to Extremity. And so the Charge being sounded,
the thick squadrons of the French, who scarcely had room for an orderly march,
came furiously on, and were when within shot met by a flight of English Arrows,
which gauling their Horses, and dismounting diverse of their Chiefs, command was
given to press on, and come to a close fight, thereby to frustrate the Archers
of the use of their Bows; at what time a furious charge being given, the
Archers retreated a few Paces, and left bare a triple tire of pointed Stakes,
which till that time they had covered; upon which the French Horsemen rushing,
a great number of their Horses were gored, and sticking as it were, altogether
disabled, barrocaded the English Army from the approach of the rest; so that
not only the Archers in the front continued to pour in their shot, but likewise
those in the Meadow that flanked the squadron of the Right Wing, began
incessantly to deliver their shafts, which in a short time wrought such
Confusion, that the French finding no place to retire amongst the thick Ranks
that still pressed on, and wedged as it were each other in, began to fall into
disorder, many of them disranking, as not being able to manage their wounded
Horses, nor could their Foot conveniently advance to their relief; so that the
men of Arms breaking in with great fury, and the English Horse charging their
Right Wing, a miserable slaughter ensued, nothing but death and flight being
seen on their part throughout the field, whilst the King himself, distinguished
by a Crown he wore on his Helmet, fought courageously, piercing their main
Battle, forcing his Horse over heaps of the slain; which the Duke of Alanso,
who commanded on that part, perceiving, broke through the foremost rank in a
desperate manner, and charged with his Sword so forcibly, that with the blow he
bruised the Kings Crown, and made him a little recoil, but the King soon
advancing, gave him such a stroke as beat him to the Ground, at which time he
cried out he was Alanso, and begged for quarter, notwithstanding which, and
though the King labored to save him, he was there slain; and now the French
began to retire in great disorder, nor was it in the power of the Commanders to
restore the battle; which advantage the English perceiving, had the Execution
of them with such a fearful slaughter, that it is reported by diverse
Historians, and some of them their own, that no less that 4000 Noblemen,
Knights, and Esquire were slain, together with 100000 of the meaner sort,
though all agree the French lost 60000 in that defeat, and so many Prisoners,
many of them of the first Rank, were taken; that the King fearing (upon fres^
Troops showing themselves upon the Hills which were indeed come too late to the
battle, as not hearing of the overthrow) tha^ being more in number than his own
men if the French reinforced should rally an^ come to another trial, they might
fall upon his Rear in the battle, caused them all except some of the Chief, to
be slain ^th^ which, although it was a bloody Sentenc^^ yet Self-preservation
at that time made it? State Policy. And soon after this Victory which he
ascribed to God alone, the King had not only Paris put into his Hands, but
Marrying Catharine, Daughter to Charles the French King, he was Crowned King of
France in Reversion, and possessed himself of all the Cities and Towns of that
Kingdom, except a few the Dolphin held out against him in Berry. Nor did this
Glorious Victory cost the English much Blood, there being not above 2500 slain;
and of Note only Edward Duke of York, and the Earl of Worcester.

Thus Haughty France drunk with her Blood did reel,
And fell before a Conquering Monarchs Steel.
Thus in old Days kind Heaven for England fought,
And Mighty Realms to her Subjection brought.
A Description of the Glorious Battle and chievements of the Mighty Scanderbeg,
King of Epirus, being an Account of his many Victories over the Turks, under
the leading of Amurath, the Second King of that Name, etc.
AMurath, the Second Turkish King of that Name, by the many Conquests he had
made, growing dreadful to the lesser Princes, diverse of them conditioned to
become his Tributaries; and amongst others, John Castriot, Prince of Epirus,
for the due Observance of which he gave his four Sons as Hostages, viz. George,
(after named by the Turks, Scanderbeg) Stamsius, Reposius, and Constantine,
Amurath promising well and honorably to entreat them; yet he had no sooner
gotten them into his Possession, but he caused them to be circumcised, and to
be instructed in the Mohammedan Superstition, poisoning, upon a Jealosie of
their intending to escape, all but the first; and after the Fathers Death
seized, contrary to his Promise, upon the Kingdom of Epirus; which not a little
grieving George Castriot, or Scanderbeg, whose Right it was, he sought (...)
ways to escape; but the crafty Turk (...) watchful Eye over him, intending at
(...) times to put him to death, but by (...) ^eans or other was as often
prevented: (...) being at length made a Commander in the Turkish Army against
the Hungarians, and that Army with a fearful slaughter overthrown by the Great
Huniades on the Plains of Moravia, he then thought it the best time to escape
and fly the Turkish Servitude; whereupon taking with him Amurath's Secretary,
with diverse of his trusty Friends, he led him into a large Wood, and there
compelled him to write in his Masters Name to the Governor of Croija, the
chief City of Epirus, as also to sign it with his Signet, to the intent that he
might deliver him up his Charge, which accordingly he did; and then having
secured him from making any Relation thereof, he posted thither, and had it
upon the sight of those Letters surrendered; at what time sending for Prince
Amasa his Kinsman, Moses, an expert Captain, and diverse others, he acquainted
them with the purpose he had to deliver his Country from the Turkish Tyranny;
who approving his undertaking, his Subjects frequently resorted to him, so that
he became very powerful, and diverse Cities revolting from the Turks, put
themselves under his Protection, as Stelusia, Petra, Alba Petrolla, so that
with a great Power he entered Macedonia, and laid those Countries that were
under the Turkish Sovereignty waste; at which unexpected News Amurath being
greatly alarmed, sent 40000 of his best Soldiers under the leading of Alis
Bassa to surprise him; but Scanderbeg retiring into Epirus, gave him battle
with no more than 6000 Men, and after a sharp dispute overthrew him with the
slaughter of 22000 of his Men, not losing above 300 of his own, carrying in a
manner the battle with his Prowess; for charging the Turkish squadrons, he
broke through, beating down all with an irresistible force that stood before
him; so that his men following him had little to do but to slaughter the routed
and amazed Turks. After which Amurath sent Mustapha Bassa with a great Army to
waste Epirus, who was by Scanderbeg overthrown, and himself taken Prisoner.

These overthrows so enraged Amurath, that raising a mighty Power, he came in
Person, promising great Rewards to those that could bring Scanderbeg's Head,
and so besieged Sfetigrade; but although he battered it incessantly with his
Cannon, and made frequent Assaults with the loss of 20000 of his best men, it
was so resolutely defended by the Governor, who would not be corrupted by any
offers of Gold, that he despaired with his huge Army to win it; and fearing by
the Sallies of the besieged, and the frequent Assaults Scanderbeg made with his
flying Army, by breaking into one quarter or other of his Camp, that his
multitude being consumed, he should be obliged to return with disgrace; he in
the end indented (for a Sum of Money in hand, and a larger quantity when it
should be effected) with an inconsiderable Fellow, by Occupation a Smith, to
cause the City to be surrendered, which he brought to pass in the following
manner.

The City of Sfetigrade, by most held impregnable, being situate upon a Rock,
and for that Reason affording but one Well or main Spring, which in abundance
furnished the Citizens and Soldiers; into this Well in the Nightime the
Traitor cast the stinking putrefied Carcass of a Dog that had lain a long time
in the Streets, which being found and drawn thence the next Morning, as
likewise noised throughout the City, as well the Citizens as Soldiers refused
any more to drink of it; nor could the Governor with all his Persuasions and
Entreaties oblige them to it, though himself, to convince them of the
wholsomness of the Water, drank often in their sight; but they rather chose to
undergo the worst Extremities of Thirst, by which means many of them died; so
that the Governor through this Nicety of his Soldiers not finding the City
tenable, was obliged to capitulate; and marching out with Bag and Baggage, was
conducted to Scanderbegs Army: and he by whose Treachery the City fell into the
Hands of the Turks, being for a while seemingly carress'd, was in the end
secretly made away: yet upon Amurath's return Scanderbeg fell upon the Rear of
his Army, and cut off 3000 of his Men.

The year following Amurath returned with a greater Army and besieged Croija,
the chief City of Epirus; but losing under its Walls without success 30000 men,
and despairing notwithstanding to win it, he died in his Tent Anno 1450.
leaving his Son Mahomet to succeed him in his Empire, charging him to be
revenged of Scanderbeg, with whom his Armies under the leading of diverse
Bassa's fought many bloody Battles, but were always worsted by the invincible
Prince, even with a handful of men, his Force and Courage being such, that he
often with his own hand turned the Scale of Victory when it was inclining to
his Enemies; nor could the Corruption of his great Captains with vast Sums of
Turkish Gold alter his Fortune: so that having stood twenty four years the
Champion and Bulwork of Christendom, he at last died in Peace at Lyssa; which
Town nine years after his Death being taken by the Turks, they opened his
Sepulcher, and took thence his bones, for which they had such a Veneration,
that happy was he that could get the smallest piece of them; which being got,
they counted of great Value, and wore it about them as an inestimable Jewel,
fancying that ever after Scanderbeg's Fortune would attend them.

Thus di'd the Hero far Renowned in Arms,
Whose very Name the Globe with Wonder charms.
No Power from him could take the Laureat Prize,
Till All-subduing Death sealed up his Eye,
And laid him up till he more Glorious Rise.
Englands Pharsalia, or the bloody Civil War between King Henry the Sixth, of
the House of Lancaster, Richard Duke of York, and Edward the Fourth, of the
House of York; describing the several Fights and pitched Battles wherein 100000
Men on both sides are accounted to be slain, etc.
RIchard Duke of York taking distaste at the Release of the Duke of Somerset by
King Henry the Sixth, he with the Earl of Warwick, and diverse others his
Accomplices, fell to open Force, and levied an Army about the Marches of Wales,
with which they marched toward London, under pretense of redressing
Grievances, and removing evil Counselors; to oppose whom King Henry drew out,
and both Armies meeting at St. Albans, in the County of Hertford, the Duke sent
to the King to demand diverse Lords that were about him, and such as he should
name or prescribe; but being rejected with disdain, the charge was sounded, and
both Armies joined Battle furiously, and maintained a doubtful fight, till at
length Victory began to declare for the King; but the Scale was soon turned,
for Warwick breaking through the Gardens with about 2000 men, and his approach
not being there suspected, the Kings Army, (many of the chief Nobility being
slain) was broken, yet would he not fly, but stood the shot of the Archers till
wounded in the Neck, he was taken Prisoner; and being carried to London, and a
Reconciliation made on both parts, the Duke being shortly constituted Governor
of Ireland. In this fatal Batal of St. Albans between the Houses of York and
Lancaster, fell forty eight Noblemen, Knights, and Esquires, and amongst them
the Earls of Somerset, Northumberland, and Stafford, together with 5000 of the
meaner sort, and many were wounded, amongst whom was the King.

Long did not the seeming Reconciliation last, but the Duke of York raising new
Troubles, was, together with the Earls of March, Rutland, Warwick, and
Salisbury, with others of less Note, attainted of High Treason in Parliament,
but it so little discouraged them, that drawing out from the several places
where they were retired with their Army, consisting of 25000 men, they took the
Field, against whom the Kings Army advanced with great speed, so that meeting
at Northampton, a cruel and bloody fight ensued, but in the end, the King being
unfortunate in War, his Army was worsted, and himself a second time made
Prisoner, there being on both sides not less than ten thousand men slain, and
of Note Humphry Duke of Buckingham, the Earl of Shrewsbury, and the Lord
Egremont; and a Parliament being called, the Duke laid claim to the Crown,
deriving his Pedigree from Leonel the Third Son of Edward the Third, elder
Brother to John of Gaunt, the Father of Henry the Fourth, Grandfather to the
King: so that after a great debate, at length it was concluded on all parts,
that King Henry during his natural Life should quietly possess and enjoy the
Crowns and Kingdoms, and afterward they to remain in general Tail to the Duke
of York and his Heirs. But the Queen, a Woman of a Masculine Spirit, not
approving that her Son Prince Edward, a Youth of great hope, should be so
excluded, withdrew her self into the North, and there, without the consent of
the King, raised Forces to secure his Right, against whom the Duke advanced
with an Army, but unadvisedly giving her Battle near Sands Castle before his
whole Forces were come up, and falling into several Ambushes laid for the
purpose, he himself after a bloody and doubtful fight being slain, together
with the Earl of Rutland, his Son, and the Earl of Salisbury, with three
thousand more of lesser Note; and his Head being cut off was crowned with a
Paper Crown, and in derision carried through the Queens Victorious Army.

The Duke slain, many hoped that this Calamitous War would have an end, but
failed in their Expectations, for Edward Earl of March having raised an Army of
23000 men in the Marches of Wales, and hearing of his Fathers Death, advanced
with great speed, overthrowing in a great Battle the Earls of Pembrook and
Ormond, who endeavored near Ludlow to oppose his passage, in which Battle were
slain 3800 men, and several Prisoners of Note taken, and amongst them Owen
Tuder, Father-in-Law to the King, whose Head by the Command of the Earl was cut
off; and so he continued his March to fight the Army that yet remained with the
Queen, who was advanced as far as St. Albans, and had overthrown the Londoners
who came to oppose her, entering their City with the slaughter of 2000 of them,
and took the King, whom they had brought along with them to countenance their
undertaking. But Edward Earl of March approaching her with his Army, which was
much increased by the way, she thought it not convenient to give battle, but
suffering him to enter London, retired into Scotland. Whilst he taking upon him
the Title of King, was Crowned at Westminster, but was not settled in his
Throne, before News was brought that King Henry with diverse Lords were in the
North with a great Army; whereupon he drew out his Forces to give them battle,
marching directly to Pomfract in Yorkshire, sending the Lord Fitz-Walter
before to take the Charge of the Passage of Ferry Bridge, where that Lord, with
many others were slain, and King Henry's Forces gaining the Pass, the Armies
came in sight of each other, and drew up in Battalia, being the greatest that
had been seen in England since the Conquest, Edwards consisting of 48660, and
Henry's of 60000 fighting Men, when after some pause the Trumpets sounded the
Charge, and the Army moved furiously, when Warwick, who lead the Vaunt-guard,
to encourage his men, put from his Horse, by whose Example many did the like,
resolving to win the Field, or dye in the Battle; so that after It had
continued with great slaughter for the space of ten hours, and most of
theCommanders on King Henry's part slain, his Battle swerved, nor could the
Courage and Skill of those that survived restore it, but a fearful flight
ensued, while the Victors following the Execution, covered all the Field with
dead Bodies, whilst the Blood streamed in Channels; for in this Battle fought
between the Towns of Towton and Saxton on the twenty ninth of March, fell
Persons of Quality to the number of 375, amongst which were Henry Piercy, Earl
of Northumberland, and John Lord Nevel, Brother to the Earl of Warwick, John
Lord Clifford, and John Lord Wells, and of the meaner sort 35091, whereupon
King Henry with his Son and Queen fled into Scotland, and Edward returned to
London.

This fatal blow, though it put a damp to their Spirits, did not altogether
discourage the Lancastrians, for Queen Margaret going into France, raised new
Supplies in that Kingdom, but making toward England, her Fleet was scattered
by a Tempest, and she driven upon the Coast of Scotland with the smaller part
of it; yet finding her Husband in the Scottish Court highly entertained by James
their King, she took heart, and soon after the Scots entered England as far as
Durham, when King Edward preparing to meet them, marched to York, and there
making a halt, sent the Lord Montacute to oppose and hinder their further
Progress; but being encountered on Hedgly Moor by the Lords Hungerford and
Ross, together with Sir Ralph Peircey, he after a sharp dispute took Sir Ralph
Prisoner, which success encouraged him to pass on and give battle to King
Henry, who lay encamped at Hexam, where both Armies striving to do their utmost
devoir, a bloody conflict ensued, but many being slain, and much blood spilt,
diverse of the Commanders wounded and disabled, and taken Prisoners, Victory
declared against King Henry, who finding himself unfortunate in War, fled into
Scotland; in this battle 5600 were slain, and the Duke of Somerset with three
other Lords, and one Knight taken Prisoners, who were all beheaded. And now
King Henry returning privately into England in disguise, was taken Prisoner,
and carried to the Tower, so that Edward seemed established in his Throne: yet
Fate not satisfied with English Blood, though the wounded Nation had bled such
Streams as made her faint and languish, another cruel War arose, and the
Factions began again to bandy as fierce as ever, for Warwick, who was called
afterward the make King of those Times, being sent to solicit a Marriage
between King Edward and the Lady Bona, Daughter to Lewis Duke of Savoy, and
having finished his Negotiation to the liking of the Lady and her Father, found
upon his return tha^ the King was married to Elizabeth the Widow of Sir John
Gray, slain in upholding the Cause of King Henry, at which the Eat^ (supposing
his Honor that had been engaged in the Savoiards Court greatly to suffer) grew
much enraged, and finding mean to withdraw himself, joined with diver Nobles,
raised a Power, and proclaime^ King Henry, declaring for him, and epousing his
Interest, growing on a sudde^ so strong, that King Edward was forced t^ draw
out his Army and march against him pitching his Camp at Wolney, four Mil^ from
the Plain on which Warwick was encamped; but his Guards being negligent and the
Earl having notice thereof, entere^ the Kings Camp and took him Prisoner, ye^
used him very courteously, allowing him for his Keeper his Brother George
Nevil^ Archbishop of York, who suffering him t^ ride abroad a hunting, and to
follow other Recreations, till one day being with a slender Guard far from the
Castle, and meeting a great Troop of his own Men, those tha^ were with him
durst not speak to him (...) returning to his Confinement, but were gla^ to
leave him behind them, and escape for their Lives; so that being again at
Liberty, he was received by his Army with great Joy, and passed to London to
the great discontent and dislike of the Earl of Warwick.

Things being at this pass, Sir Robert Wells, Son to the Lord Wells, raised an
Army of 30000, consisting mostly of the Commons of Lincolnshire, on the behalf
of King Henry, in revenge of which, King Edward caused the Lord Wells, and Sir
Thomas Dimmock his Kinsman, to be beheaded; and so marched to fight Sir Robert,
when charging furiously upon the unexperienced Plebeans, they scarcely
sustained the second shock, but throwing away their Coats and Weapons, fled for
their Lives, from whence it was called the Battle of Loose-Coat-Field; and the
Execution ^eing hotly pursued by the enraged Soul^iers, 10000 of them are
accounted to be ^ain. As for Sir Robert Wells and Sir Thomas Deland, who
commanded under him, ^hey were taken Prisoners. Upon the News of this Defeat
the Earl of Warwick, and the Duke of Clarence, Brother to King Edward, ^ed to
Callais, but being denied entrance, ^hey departed thence to the Court of
France, where they found Queen Margaret; where gathering great Forces, they
returned to England, every where proclaiming King Henry; so that the People
from all parts hasted to their Standart, as well the Nobles as the Commons,
viz. the Earl of Pembrook, the Lord Faulconberg, and others; so that marching
toward London, and King Edward finding his Mandates in many places disobeyed,
thought it not convenient in that juncture to attend the Sequel, but with
diverse of his trusty Friends le^^ England, and fled to his Brother-in-Law the
Duke of Burgundy, who had a little before married his Sister; so that King
Henry wa^ Re-in-throned, but continued not long i^ that Estate before King
Edward returned landing in the North with a small Army proclaiming King Henry
as he passed, and pretending he came only as a private man to possess himself
of his Inheritance, b^ which means deceiving the People, h^ surprised the City
of York, and having garrisoned it, pulled off the Vizor, and marched toward
London, reconciling himself by the way through the means of a Mai^ (who had been
brought up by the old Duchess of York) to his Brother the Duke of Cl^rence;
whereupon the Citizens opening their Gates, and every where proclaiming him
King, Henry was again taken Prisoner an^ send to the Tower; and now the whole
weight of the War lying upon Warwicks shoulders, he desperately resolved to
carry the day, or fighting courageously dye in the Bed of Honor; and thereupon
directed his March toward London, out of which King Edward drew his Forces to
meet him, and on Easter Day joined Battle near Barnet, since known by the
Battle of Barnet-field, where either of the Generals, impatient of so tedious a
War, drew on their Forces with great force and fury, Warwick charging upon the
Kings Squadron broke in with his Sword, and made such Destruction, that they
fled on that part; and the Battle had gone on his side, had there not been a
mistake in part of his Men, who by mistaking their Cognizances, charged upon
their fellows, which making them suspect some Treason or sudden Revolt, they
threw down their Weapons and fled; which Warwick perceiving, and not finding it
in his power to retain them, or restore the Battle, (though he labored by
Example and Persuasion to do it, resolving not to outlive the day) ^he rushed
furiously amongst the Squadrons of the Enemy, and there fighting valiantly,
fell upon the heaps of the slain; and with him died his Brother the Lord
Montacute, and three other Lords were slain on the part of King Edward, and of
the meaner sort on both sides 20000. The News of this defeat made known to
Queen Margaret and Prince Edward her Son, (by such as fled the field) she took
Sanctuary in the Abbey of Ceerne, but the Lords that escaped the Battle of
Barnet, rallying their scattered Forces, gave King Edward another Battle at
Tewxbury, in which they were overthrown with the loss of 3000 men, and of Note
the Earl of Devonshire, and the Duke of Somerset's Brother: there likewise
Prince Edward was taken, and soon after stabbed by Crook-back'd Richard, Duke
of Gloucester, in the Presence of King Edward, and soon after King Henry was
murdered, and his Queen taken from Sanctuary, and put to a great Ransom.

Thus stopped the Stream of Blood when drained near dry,
Thus our Pharsalia, England's Tragedy
Was Acted in a bloody Scene, till Death
With slaughter tired, was almost out of breath.
What Lands, what Kingdoms might our men have ^ane
With that Bloods loss which Civil hands have drawn.
Such Powers united as our Fields distained,
By Conquering on vast Empires might have gained:
Have overset bold Ott'mans Rising Throne,
And seen his Conquests far beneath their own.
A Description of the Battle of Bosworth-field, fought between Richard the
Third King of England, and Henry Earl of Richmond, known afterward by the Title
of King Henry the Seventh, etc.
AFter the Death of Edward the Fourth, Richard Plantagenet, Duke of Gloucester
having caused his two Nephews to be murdered, usurped the Throne, endeavoring
to establish himself therein, as he had first acquired it, viz. by blood; so
that greatly oppressing his Subjects, and especially the Nobility, as also
causing Queen Ann his Wife secretly to be made away, that he might marry
Elizabeth his Niece, Daughter to his Brother King Edward the Fourth; diverse
conspired against him, and amongst the rest the Duke of Buckingham, who had
been the main Instrument in helping him into the Throne, but raising Forces,
and being unsuccessful in his attempt, his men flying and leaving him to shift
for himself, he resorted to the House of one Banister, who had been his
Steward, and had got a good Estate under him, where for a time he secured
himself in disguise to attend his better fortune, though it proved otherwise,
for King Richard seting 1000 l. upon his head, the same Banister in whom he
confided discovered him to the Sherif of the County, who seizing upon him in
the Disguise or Habit of a Gardener, carried him to Salisbury, where (by the
Command of the King) without Arraignment or Trial, he was beheaded. And now by
a secret Contract the Earl of Richmond being betrothed to the Lady Elizabeth,
Eldest Daughter to Edward the Fourth, after having escaped many Dangers beyond
the Scas, and his Faction being strong in England, prepares, with such an Army
as he could well gather by the favor of the Duke of Brittany, and increased by
such English as fled to him for fear of the Usurper, for England, and landed at
Milford-Haven, his Retinue not exceeding 2000, but was soon increased to a far
greater number by those that daily came to join him, which made King Richard
advance with his Army to oppose him, and pitched his Tents at Radmore near
Bosworth in Leicestershire; and both Armies being drawn up in Battalia, the
Lord Stanly with a great Detachment kept aloof on the Hills, and the King
suspecting he intended to revolt from him to his Enemy, sent to him to advance,
but he refused, saying, he would do it when he saw his time, whereupon King
Richard in a great Rage commanded his Son, whom he had in Hostage for the
Fathers Fidelity, instantly to be beheaded, but was by some of his Favorites
persuaded to defer it till the Battle was over, by which means the young man
escaped, for both Armies joining with great fury, a bloody and doubtful fight
ensued; so that for a long time the Scale of Victory hung in an equal poise,
King Richard commanding and fighting courageously in all parts: but the Lord
Stanly when both Armies had tried their Strengths, and were weary with
fighting, coming in with his fresh men, bore down all before him; so that King
Richard perceiving the Fortune of the War to go against him, like a man in
despair, resolving not to survive it, charged with great fury amongst the
thickest Squadrons, and having killed and beaten down many, was at length
over-pow'red, and himself slain, falling upon heaps of his Enemies; his Crown
was afterward found in a Hawthornbush, and himself stripped naked, was carried
all bloody upon a Horse to Leicester, and there buried in the Grey-Friars with
much Solemnity, after its being exposed two days to the People. In this Battle,
called the Battle of Bosworth-field, 6000 men on either side were slain, and
amongst them diverse of Note. And now the Earl of Richmond being Crowned in the
Field, marched to London, and soon after solemnly married the Lady Elizabeth,
joining the Houses of Lancaster and York; he being the Heir of the one, and she
the Heiress of the other.

And so the Discord to soft Concord yields,
That with the Bones of the slain made white the Fields;
Dividing Friends in an unfriendly Jar,
Rending the tor'ring State with Impious War,
Whilst Father against Son, Brothers with Brothers fight,
Not caring who was wrong or who was right,
But smeer'd with Blood in Cruelty delight:
Being emulous who most could vent his Rage,
Such is the fate when Civil Arms engage.
A description of the Battle of Seminara, fought in the Kingdom of Naples,
between King Ferdinand, then entitled to that Kingdom, and the Great Gonsalves
Ca^tain of the Spaniards on the one part, and the Lords Obignny and Persive,
for Charles the French King on the other part, Anno 1495.
CHarles the French King, victorious in Italy, having won many strong Places
and Countries, and amongst the rest, the Rich and Fertile Kingdom of Naples;
Ferdinand, in whose right it was, raising an Army of Spaniards, Sicilians,
Italians, etc. and entered the Provinces the French had a little before brought
to their Subjection, in order to recover them, advancing as far as the Country
of Seminara, to oppose whom the Lord Obignny Governor of Calabria for the
French King, and the Lord Persive Governor of Bosilicula, marched with their
united Forces from their appointed Rendezvous at Terranova to Seminara, to
fight the King or besiege him in the Town, who knowing nothing of their
Conjunction, and ignorant of their number, issued out of the Town upon news of
their approach to give them Battle, not staying for the Troops he expected from
Puglia Campagnia and Arbuzzo, though Gonsalves, counted the expertest Captain
of his Age, labored to dissuade him from fight; for being in the flower of
Youth, and height of his Spirit, he rather strove to expose his Valor than
hearken to good Counsel; and so having made an excellent Speech or Oration to
animate the Captains and Soldiers to do their utmost, he marched toward
Terranova three miles along the Hills; and coming to the River, lodged his Foot
on the left Bank, and his Horsemen he stretched on the right to serve for a
Wing; and so continued to expect the Enemy.

By this time the French and Switzers came in sight, and Obignny cast the
latter into a firm Battalion, placing the Foot, raised in Calabria, behind them
as a Battle of Succor, dividing the Squadron of Horse between them, being Men
at Arms, and in the same order the light Horsemen; and so in a square Battle
they pass d the River, whereupon the Spanish Horse advanced to oppose them, but
being hotly charged by the thick Battalion of the French in the Advaunt-guard,
after many of them were beaten down and slain, the rest were obliged to retire,
by fetching a compass in wheeling off to their main strength, which much
discouraged the Arragonian Footmen, who at first supposed they were discomfited
fled the Field, leaving them to the fury of the French, etc. The Horsemen thus
forced to retreat, Obignny advanced with great speed, and charged the Footmen
on the right, whilst Persive did the like on the lest, disordering their Horse
before the Switzers came to the fight, who no sooner came on but gave a furious
Charge with their Pikes; so that the main Batte^ of King Ferdinand being broken
and disordered, his Men were slain on all parts, nor did the Spanish Horse come
timely to their Succor; nor could the King (though he labored all eh could)
restore the battle, notwithstanding (with a Troop of select Horse being his
Guard) he charged desperately amongst the thickest Ranks; and after having
broken his Lance, drew his Sword and fought till he saw all manner of hopes to
prevail were vain, and finding in his Army nothing but flight and fearful
Confusion, he at the persuasion of his Favorites got clear of the Battle and
fled upon a swift Horse, yet by the way fell into a deep Pit with his Horse
upon him, but was soon relieved by John Attavillia, who mounting the King upon
his own Horse, he thereupon escaped; and himself on foot not capable of
escaping, was slain by the Pursuers: so that he paid his Life to the safety of
his Prince.

Obignny having thus with much slaughter defeated the Kings Forces, and some
being slain in the pursuit, called back his Soldiers, and encamped not far
from (...) Place of Battle, upon which he was (...) by many as a Captain who
(...) how to get a Victory, than to (...) obtained; for if the pursuit (...)
few of the Kings Forces (...) had the Towns upon the Terror of this defeat
failed to have surrendered upon summons, but staying here, the King with many of
his Nobles got safe to their Ships, and Gonsalves with his rallied Troops found
means ot retreat to Rezo.

Thus by Neglect, a Battle when it was gained,
Not being unprov'd, the Generals Honor stained.
A Description of the Battle of Vaila or Giardda, fought in Lumbardy, between
Lewis the Eleventh of France, and the Seignory of Venice, Anno 1509.
UPon the Venetians making their Encroachments in Italy and other Places, to
empower and enrich themselves upon what appertained to others, Lewis the French
King, aided by diverse Princes, marched from Millan with an Army to hinder their
Proceedings, and oblige them (...) Restitution, who likewise prepared to (...)
him, with a great Army encamp^ (...) the River Adda, under the (...) the Earl
of Petillia their Gene^ (...) D Alvina Master of the (...) were joined George
Cor^ (...) Grittie Providitors, who (...) the French, kept in a strong Lodgment
till they might find an advantageous Opportunity to draw out or decamp, which
made the King seize upon Vaila and Pandino, that by the help of those Garrisons
he might cut off their Provision, and by that means the sooner to oblige them
to fight; nor did that Stratagem fail of its desired end, for the Venetian
General knowing that by that means he must come to a Battle, drew out his Army
on the right Bank of the River, consisting of 2000 men at Arms, and 20000
Footmen, besides about 4000 Light-Horsemen, mostly Italians and Greeks, whilst
over against them on the other Bank, marched the French Army, consisting of
2000 men at Arms, 6000 Switzers, 12000 Gascones and Italian Foot men, with a
considerable number of Pioneers, and many Fieldpieces; and the Venetians being
encumbered with the Bushes and Shrubs that grew on their side, were forced to
march slowly, so that the French out-marched them, placing in their
Avaunt-guard 500 men at Arms, and a Regiment of Switzers under the leading of
Charles de' Ambroise, and John James de Trivulzi, which Vaunt-guard finding
means to pass the River before the Venetians expected it, attacked the Rear of
the Venetian Army commanded by Alvia, consisting of 8000 men at Arms, and
almost all the best footmen, which made him to send to the Earl of Petillia,
who led the Vaunt-guard, to inform him of the Necessity there was to fight, but
he returned answer, that he ought to march on and shun the Enemy as much as in
him lay, for such was the order of the Senate; yet Alvian, carried away with
the desire of Glory, resolved with such Forces as he had to bear the brunt of
the Battle rather than to be out-braved, or so meanly suffer his Honor to be
eclipsed; whereupon placing his Footmen with six pieces of Cannon on a little
Bay made by a certain winding of a Brook which was then dry, he with his great
shot having disordered the French Foot, furiously broke in upon them and put
them into great Confusion, their Horse (by reason of the Vines that grew in
that Place) not being well able to support them; so that the King seeing his
men put to the worst, and ready to fly, hasted to their Succor with fresh
Troops, and by degrees drew Alvian into the Plain, so that the Avaunt-guard and
middle Battle had Opportunity to charge him, though he wanted not Courage to
make great resistance, exciting them in all parts (with his Hands, Voice and
Actions) to fight courageously; nor did the French (when they saw their King in
the Battle) charge with less fury, so that a bloody and doubtful fight
continued, though the Earl was not come up with the rest of the Forces, but the
Venetians having fought with singular Valor for the space of three hours, and
not being succored, were in the end overpowered by the number of the French
Horsemen, who breaking in amongst the ranks of the Foot, wearied already by a
stout resistance, having done all that could be expected from true Valor, and
lost rather Strength than Courage; they yet for the most part never turned
their backs, but either died or were taken Prisoners fighting in the Place: so
that had the other part of the Army succored them, they had been victorious.
In this Battle 8000 are reputed to be slain, and 2000 taken Prisoners, amongst
which was Alvian, and soon after most of the Places the Venetians had won
surrendered; the Generals Excuse was that he had Command from the Senate not to
fight.

Thus by Neglect, or a bad timed Command,
Battles are gone that never can be regained;
And that which Years with Blood and Labor cost,
In one Ill-faughten Field few hour's have lost.
A Description of the Battle of Ginghat, fought in Picardy between Henry the
Eighth, King of England, and Monsieur de Piennes General for Lewis the French
King, Anno 1513.
KIng Henry the Eighth lying at the Siege of Turwin, which he beleagured with
three Camps, the first commanded by himself, the second by the Earl of
Shrewsbury, and the third by the Lord Herbert; upon notice that the French Army
was coming to its relief, he passed over the River with a considerable part of
his Army detached for that purpose, whilst the remainder continued the siege,
furnished with Ordinance and all other Necessaries to impeach or hinder their
march, their Army consisting of 15000 effectual men, part of which were sent
over the River ^ar below the Town to relieve it, whilst the rest intended only
to skirmish with the Kings Army, and so to make their retreat as well as they
could when the Business was effected, for the besieged were indeed in a great
Straight for want of Provision, when the King, to show the little dread he had
of the French, not so much as taking down his Tents, but leaving the Lord Darcy
with a small Train to guard them, advanced his Standard, the Horse marching a
mile before the Foot, which the Germans that were in the Kings Army perceiving,
on a sudden imbattelled by themselves on the Right, which gave some suspicion
that they intended to revolt, though it proved otherwise; yet by this means
they left the front of the Kings Battle unguarded; but that undaunted Monarch,
not to be amuzed, nor in the least doubting the Victory, which never yet had
failed him, kept on his way, and before he came within sight of the French, was
met by Maximilian, Emperor of Germany, who had for his Guard 30 men at Arms
well appointed, and wearing Red Crosses, when a Council being called, it was
agreed that diverse pieces of Ordnance being commodiously planted to incommode
the Enemy in their approach; the Horse, in the head of which the King would
have marched, but at the entreaty of his Nobles was persuaded to remain with
the Foot as safest; with him stayed the Emperor, and amongst the Avaunt-guard
were mounted diverse Archers; which Resolves of the Council were scarce put in
Execution before the French Army appeared marching in three long or extended
battles, whereupon the Earl of Essex, who commanded the greater part of the
English Horse, and Sir John Pechey with another Squadron of English and
Burgundian Horse, marched in the Valley with Banners displayed, whilst the
Lords Wallon and Ligney with the Burgundian Horse made a squadron separate, and
the foot moved in a gross battle, and so ascending from the lower to the higher
Ground, Sir Henry Guilford, under whose charge the Archers on Horseback were
to the number of an 100, drew out as the forlorn hope, and skirmished with the
Avaunt-guard of the French till the rest of the Horse came up, at what time
they alighted, and strongly intrenching, served as part of a Wing to flank the
Foot, and the Battle joining with great fury, so that the English Horsemen
(crying St. George) charging in the Front, and the Archers continually pouring
in their shot of Arrows, the French battle was in a manner over-set at the
first charge, for many of their Standards being overthrown, and some that
commanded slain, they in great Confusion began to shrink together, and such as
could conveniently disrank at that time fled, throwing away their Weapons, and
cuting off the Barbs of their Horses to fly the lighter, whilst the English
(who were far inferior to them in number of Horse, viz. scarce one to ten) had
little to do but follow the Execution and take prisoners; for though the
Burgundian Horse came not in till the Battle was in a manner won, yet such was
the fear of the French, that those who were in the Rear perceiving the
Vaunt-guard in rout, fled without striking a stroke, as likewise did diverse
Troops who were not come to the Battle, for having notice of what had happened by
some that fled, they faced about and fled foremost; so that the chase being
hotly made for the space of three miles, the Earl of Essex upon such an easy
Victory fearing some Ambush, caused the retreat to be sounded, and returned to
the Kings Battle which had not fought, bringing many Prisoners of Note, and
much Riches; for in this Battle, fought on the sixth of August, were taken the
Duke of Longuvile, the Lord Cleremont, and other Noblemen and Gentlemen, to
the number of 242, besides what the Burgundians took and concealed in order to
release them at lesser Ransomes than otherwise would have been taken. As for
the slain they were not above 800, wherefore in consideration of the small
resistance and cowardly flight, the Frenchmen have named it the Battle of
Spurs. Nor did those that were appointed to attack the Earl of Shrewsbury's
Camp succeed better; for being no sooner skirmished with by Sir Rice ap Thomas,
but they faced about and fled, and though the besieged sallied, yet were they
valiantly repulsed by the Lord Herbert, who with considerable slaughter pursued
them to the Gates of the Town, so that despairing of Relief they yielded up the
Place to the King, as likewise did the famous City of Tournay.

Thus failed French Valor, thus the English sought,
By Gallick Powers the Dastard Nation fought,
(And they soon Conquer) Nations that the Field
Will leave for threats, or un-try'd Battles yield.
That the English are not such, Fames Scroles make good,
Often writ in France like Draco's Laws in Blood.
A Description of the Great and Memorable Battle fought on the Banks of the
River Boristhenes, between Bassilius the Great Duke of Moscovy, and Constantine
General of Sigismund, King of Poland, Anno 1514.
BAssilius the Great Duke of Muscovy having taken Smolensco from the Poles by
surprise, not contented therewith, advanced with an Army of 40000 Horse to
waste Lithuania; to oppose whose Progress King Sigismund sent Constantine his
General, a Man of great Experience in Martial Affairs, and under his Command
2000 men at Arms, 12000 Lithuanians, mostly Archers, and 3000 Footmen, Pikes
intermixed with Harquibusiers: nor did the Great Duke hinder their passing the
River Boristhenes, supposing by that means to have them the surer in his Power,
but making a moving Oration to encourage his Soldiers, he detached about 7000
Horsemen, whom he commanded by a great compass fetched about, to place
themselves at the Rereward of the Poles, that when the Battle was joined and
hot on all parts, they might break in upon them, with strict order to cover
themselves till an Opportunity offered, in a Neighboring Valley overshadowed
with Woods, and the rest of his Army he divided into three squadrons, placing a
Wing of 12000 Horsemen on the Right, commanded by Michael Golujza, the second
he placed as a left Wing, but somewhat at a distance under the Hills, that it
might be as a reserve or Battle of Succor, and the middle Battle himself
commanded, where was his Baggage, and therein he placed the Strength of his
Army.

Whilst this was doing, Constantine was not Idle, but proposing to himself that
the unarmed Moscovites would be much Inferior to him in Prowess, though
Superior in number, if he could bring his Men into such Order that they might
without any great damage sustain the first shock of the Archers, and suddenly
bring the Battle to be tried by the Sword, wherefore he placed the men at Arms
in the front, ranging them in wedged Battle, making two Wings of the Lithuanian
Horse, and placed the Foot behind the Men an Arms to support them; and so
riding from Rank to Rank he admonished them to do their utmost for the Honor
of their King and Country, and not by any Cowardice in them be a means to lose
a Battle upon which depended their Lives and Liberties, etc. He would have
proceeded, but whilst he was speaking the Moscovi^ sounded the Charge,
whereupon commanding the Captains in the Vaunt-guard to break in upon the Enemy
with their Spears, mauger their shot of Arrows, each battle moved furiously,
and although the Arrows flew thick as Hail, yet the Poles passed on, though
some, yet but a few o^ them were slain; so that the Archers being frustrated in
a trice, they brought i^ to the Sword, so that the Lithuanian stretching out
their Wings, and the^ straitning them, made good their Archers, who sorely
gauled the Moscovites, who being on all sides in a manner oppressed, could
neither give back, nor brake through in the front, and those that were behind
still thrusting them forward, break their Array, bearing out side-ways upon the
Wings of the Lithuanians, so at one time they attacked two Incounters in diverse
places, so that the fight being hot on all parts, and the Duke finding himself
overcharged, sent to Command the Horsemen in Ambush to advance, who soon
discovered themselves, and came on with horrid cries and sounds of Trumpets, to
be thought more dreadful in their number, which the Polonian General
perceiving, ordered his Battle to stand firm, yet Polosky, a Palatine of that
Kingdom, turned on them a squadron of Footmen which had not been much shaken,
and sustaining the first shock of their Arrows, gave Command for all the
Harquibusiers to fire at once, and so by a swift advance came to the push of
Pike and Halbert, causing the Moscovite Horsemen to recoil, yet their Ranks
being close they could not expand themselves, or travers their Ground, by
reason of which they were obliged to sustain the fight in that narrow compass
with great slaughter; so that it was a pitious sight to see Men and Horses
dead, lying on heaps, weltering in Blood, and groaning out their last, whilst
in that part where the General fought, the Ranks of Moscovites were broken and
disordered, and the Right Wing of Horse almost all cut in pieces; so that the
middle Battle) wherein was yet the Person of the Great Duke) was attacked on
all sides, and the foremost Ranks pierced through, so that he despairing to
restore the fight, gave back; and now the Foot that had routed his Ambushment
of Horse having nothing to do, charged upon his Battle of Succor, and entering
their Ranks who had been shaken before by the Lithuanian Horse, they with their
Pikes and Scimiters made a miserable slaughter, putting them in all parts to
the rout; of which the Duke having notice, and how those Horse he had laid in
Ambush were likewise defeated, whom he scarce thought as yet to have made their
attack; he with a Troop of his Nobles that were his Guard, retired out of the
Battle, and left his Men to shift for themselves, making all the speed he could
to escape that Ruin and Desolation into which he had brought his Army, which
once known, nothing but flight and confusion followed, whilst the Poles had the
Execution of them for many Miles with great slaughter.

In this Battle, fought on the eighth of September, 13000 men were slain, and
many of them of Note; all the Baggage and rich Pavilions, with the Great Dukes
Standard taken, as likewise was Michael Goliza, but Smolensco being strongly
fortified could not be regained.

Thus Blood still flows, thus cruel Mars still raves,
And Drowns the Plains with Seas of Purple Waves.
A Description of the Great and Memorable Battle fought in Persia near the City
of Coy or Coios, between Hysmael the Persian Sophi, and Selymus, the First of
that Name, Emperor of the Turks.
SElymus, to obtain the Diadem, having caused his Father Bajazet the Second to
be poisoned, and to secure himself in the Throne, strangled his three Brethren,
being grieved that his two Nephews Amurath and Aladine yet lived, the one by
securing himself in the Persian Court, and the other in that of the Egyptian
Sultan, upon the former's making some Inrodes into Capadocia, he took an
opportunity to quarrel with Hysmael the Persian Sophy; and thereupon raising an
Army of 300000 Horse and Foot, and under pretense of his having aided his
Rebels, he marched to invade his Country; and so drawing his People after him
over the huge Mountains of Scodrasci, Moscii, and Ante-Taurus, he passed along
the Banks of the River Euphrates holding his way Eastward till he came to the
River Araxis, where he found all the Country wasted and destroyed by the
Persians; upon which, the Army began to fall into great want of many things, so
that the Soldiers were forced to feed upon wild Fruits, when, in the mean time
Vsta-Ogli the Persian General approached him with an Army of 80000 Horse; and
whilst either Army was at some distance one from the other, Hys^ael came in
Person to his Camp, and from thence sent a Heraul^ to Selymus to know why in a
Hostile manner he had entered his Country, having no Title thereto; to which the
Turk hautily replied, That his Grandfather, his Uncle, and himself, had greatly
endamaged the Ottoman Empire, by making several Encroachments, Inrodes, and
Invasions; and aiding the Rebels in the Reigns of Mahomet, Bajazet, and his
own, yet he esteemed them not a sufficient ground of War, but sought after his
Enemy, young Amurath, his Brother's Son, who had lately wasted Cappadocia, whom
if he would quietly and friendly deliver into his Hands, he would withdraw his
Forces, but if he refused to gratify him therein, he would with Fire and Sword
not only destroy the Confines of Armenia, but the very heart of Persia.
Notwithstanding these promises and Threats, the Persian refused to comply with
his demands in delivering up the young Prince to certain Death; yet for that
day both Armies lay in their Trenches, but the next day they drew out, and each
being put in Battel-Array, and encouraged by moving Orations to do their
utmost, the bloody blast was sounded, after which the Persian Horsemen came on
with great Futy, over-setting the Vaunt-guard, and overthrowing the Asapi by
heaps: these are a sort of ordinary Soldiers placed by the Turks for the most
part to dull the Swords of the Enemy with their Blood, and often set foremost in
Assaults to fill up the Trenches with their dead Bodies when they besieged a
Town, that the Janissaries may pass the easier over them: nor was that all, for
the Persians at the same time charged the Spahi or Turkish Horsemen in either
Wing, causing them in some Confusion to give Ground, which Selymus perceiving,
and finding they would soon charge the Battle of the Janissaries, (in the middle
of which himself remained) he caused the Orders to open to the right and the
left, where a Train of 60 pieces of Artillery was placed, and caused them to be
discharged without Intermission upon the Horsemen, who likewise opened their
Orders to avoid the murdering shot which overthrew them by whole Ranks; yet
the thundering of the Cannon so amazed the Horse, not used to hear such Noises,
nor see such deadly Engines vomit Flame, that they would not be ruled, but
flouncing and floundring, many of them cast their Riders, yet Hysmael with his
Squadron still charging the Right Wing, composed of Asian Horsemen, cut a
great number of them in pieces, but whilst Vsta Ogli his General was
endeavoring to do the like in the other part, and entering too far amongst the
Ranks, he was slain with a Harquibuss shot, which much abated the Courage of
his Men; yet could they not be prevailed with to retire, till Selymus advanced
with the Battalion of the Janissaries, yet he gained but small Advantage,
whereupon in a great Rage he commanded another Tire of Ordnance (which he had
left as his last refuge) furiously to be discharged upon the fighting
Squadrons, by which means such slaughter was made (as well of his own men as
the Persians mingled together) in the attack, that what for the Dust, Smoke,
and thundering of the Artillery (having on both sides lost in a manner their
Sight and Hearing) the Persian Horse were now so terrified, that they were no
longer to be ruled, but disranking in diverse parts, the battle became broken
and disordered; at what time Hysmael having received a slight Wound with a
Harquibuss-shot, was retired (at the Entreaty of his Friends) to have it
searched and dressed; and there having notice that his General was slain, as
also what further had happened, he caused the retreat to be sounded, which was
done in such order that the Turks durst not pursue them, nor durst they seize
upon their Camp till they knew they were out of sight, in which they found
diverse rich Pavilions wrought with Needle Work and Gold, as also many beauteous
Ladies that had accompanied their Husbands to the Wars, all of which he caused
to be set at Liberty, except one of Hysmaels Wives, whom he gave in Marriage to
one of his Bassa's.

In this Battle fought in the Galderan fields near the City of Coy, Anno 1514,
30000 Turks were slain, and amongst them diverse Bassa's and Men of Note, even
all the flower of the Army, though of the Persians not above 8000, the chief of
Note, being the General, and amongst the slain were found the bodies of diverse
Persian Women, who armed, had accompanied their Husbands to share in their good
or evil Fortune, at which Selymus admiring, caused them to be honorably
buried; and soon after had Tauris, and many other Cities put into his hands;
but in his return through hardships, and such as were cut off by the Persians
and Mountaneers, who still hovered about his Camp to take all advantages, he
lost near three parts of his Army.

Thus Selymus with slaughter fleshed at home
Plotting fresh Murders through strange Lands does roame,
(Like a Hircanian Tiger scenting blood)
From cold Araxis to warm Nilus flood,
Hastes to augment the Crimson stream late shed.
A Description of the great Battle fought between Campson Gaurus Sultan of
Egypt, and Selymus, the first of that Name, Emperor of the Turks, near Aleppo
in Syria, etc.
SElymus, the year after his Persian Expedition, having subdued the Kingdom of
Aladeules the Mountain King, under pretense of Damage done him by the
Mountaineers in his return, and getting the King into his Hands by treachery,
cut off his Head. Whilst he was taking some Towns belonging to the Persian
Sophy, whom he heard was warring against the Indians and Bactrians, He had
notice that Campson Gaurus Sultan of Egypt was coming against him with a
powerful Army, levied in Egypt and Judea, in favor of his Allie the Persian,
as hating Selymus for his Cruelty to his Father, Brethren and Nephews;
whereupon fearing he should pass the River Euphrates, and spoil his Dominions
in Asia, he sent Ambassadors to him to treat about renewing the League that had
been between him and his Father Bajazet. But the young Princes, Aladine, Son to
Mahomet, Selymus's elder Brother, and Aladeules, Son to the murdered King of
that Name, pressing the Sultan to restore them by his Arms in so just a Cause,
his Embassy was rejected, whereupon, thinking it no time to delay, he resolved
to give the Persians rest, and turn his Arms against the Egyptian Sultan, and
thereupon passed the Mountains with an Army of 300000 Men at three Places,
causing the rough Passages to be made smooth, and the Straights to be opened
for the more commodious passage of his Ordnance and Baggage, so that in five
days, contrary to the Expectation or Belief of the Sultan, he had passed the
huge Mountain of Amanus with his whole Army and all his Baggage, and Encamped
in the Plains of Commegena, where, from Alis-Beg, Governor of the Mountain
Kingdom, he had news of the Sultan's Army; so that he immediately marched
toward him, when coming in sight of each other, and the Battle on both parts
resolved upon; the Sultan divided his Army into four Battles, the first he
committed to Kerebeus, the second to Sybevius, the third to Gazzeles, and the
fourth himself reserved as a Battle of Succor, as also to defend the Camp;
whilst on the other hand Selymus placed the Asian Horsemen in the Right wing,
and the European's in the Left, and in the middle the battle of the Janissaries,
with the Artillery in the front of them, and between the two Wings his
Pentioners, being Soldiers of great Experience; and in this Order the Turks
always fight, if the Ground will permit it.

The Battles ranged and set in order, Kerebeius with his Squadron charged the
European Horsemen with great fury, but resolved now to be revenged on the
Sultan for the death of his Brother; he intended nothing more than to betray
his Trust; and thereupon, after the first Charge, that he might seem yet to do
something, wheeling off, he fell upon the Sculions, and such other slaves as
kept the Baggage, making some small slaughter of them, that at the same time,
like a cunning Traitor, he might satisfy the Expectations of his Valor, and
yet penetrate the Treason: But Sebeius the Governor of Damasco, behaved
himself far otherwise, for entering overthwart the Ranks of the Right wing of
the Turks Army, he with his Mamalukes charged with such fury, that having made
great slaughter of the Asian Horsemen, he broke in like a Tempest, bearing
down all before him till he charged upon the Ensigns in the midst of the wing,
nor could Mustapha the Beglerbeg, nor Imbrahor Bassa, with all their Forces
stand before him or restrain the flight of their Soldiers; so that cutting in
pieces the Right wing, he resolutely thrust in between the Battalion of the
Janissaries and Pentioners, there making so unexpected and lamentable a
slaughter, that Selymus was in great danger of being taken; for by the breaking
in of Sebeius, he was divided from his Footmen, in whom he reposed his
greatest Confidence; and now the Janissaries being hardly charged by Gazzeles,
who following the Fortune of Sebeius, were brought to great distress, nor could
the routed Wing find any place of Retreat.

In this Confusion and Disorder, Sinan Bassa, who had been but lightly
skirmished with by Kayerbeius, came in with the Left wing of Horse, and staid
the fury of the Mamalukes, whereat the disperced Squadrons of the Turks
rallying and taking fresh Courage, wrung the Victory out of their hands; which
they could not have done had Campson slighted the Baggage, and come in in time
with his Squadron, or Kayerbeius been true to his Trust; but the other
Commanders having performed all that could be expected from men of Courage and
Conduct; and now the thundering Ordnance playing upon the engaged Squadron, as
they had before on the Persian Horsemen, they found the Place too hot, and
thereupon seering together in a thick Troop, they broke through the midst of
those that had enclosed them, making great slaughter of the European Horsemen
and Pentioners, and so retired toward the Camp and City of Aleppo; and being
pursued by Sinan Bassa, whist Campson Gaurus endeavored to stay the flight and
restore (if possible) the battle, he was borne from his Horse in the Crowd, and
by reason of his Age, and the weight of his Armor, not being able to relieve
himself, he was in that Hurry and Confusion trodden to death; and being
afterward found amongst the slain, was exposed to the view of the People, that
they might not flatter themselves with his being alive.

In this great battle, fought on the 17th of August 1516, no less than thirty
thousand Turks were slain, and about the like number of Egyptians and
Mamalukes, so that after two other mortal battles with Tomombeus, whom the
Mamalukes chose their Sultan, after the death of Campson, one in the great City
of Caire, which lasted three days with great Effusion of blood, and the other
upon the banks of Nilus, no less dreadful, all the Rich Countries of Egypt and
Palestine fell into the hands of the Turks, who possess it to this day; for
Tomombeus, flying after the last Defeat, was taken in a Marish among the Flags
up to the Neck in Water, and brought to Selymus, who would not admit him to his
Presence; but after he had rid upon a rugged Camel with his Face to the Tail
quite through the City of Caire in derision, he was hanged upon a Hook, under the
Gate of that City, and all the Mamalukes that could be found put to the Sword.

Thus Turkish Cruelty does wider spread,
And Death in Triumph by their Swords is Lead,
Glutted with Slaughter, he no Famine feels,
But Drunk with Blood profusely shed, He reels.
A Description of the fatal Battle of Nugis, fought between Lewis King of
Hungary, and Selymus, the First of that Name, Emperor of the Turks, at Nugis
in the Kingdom of Hungary, etc.
LEwis King of Hungary, upon notice that Solomon was advancing to Invade his
Kingdom with a powerful Army, and not being able to obtain Assistance of the
neighboring Princes, raised the whole Power of his own Country, not amounting
to above 30000 Men, and those but slenderly skilled in the Trains of War, yet
at the Persuasions of one Tomoreus, who promised him assured Victory, telling
him he had it by Revelation, the King young and unexperienced, rejected the
Counsel of some grave Captains who foresaw the Danger of fighting eight to one,
with an approved Warrior (for Solomon approached with no less than 300000 Men)
and resolved to give the Turks battle; so that it was not long ever both Armies
confronted each other, near to a small Town called Nugis, between Belgrade and
Buda, whenas the Turkish Commanders seeing the weakness of the King, besieged
his Camp for many days, yet the said Tomoreus desisted not to promise him
Victory, and undertook to set the Army in Battel-array, and indeed it was now
too late to think of Retreating without fighting their way through; so that the
Foot being stretched in a long Line as commodiously as the Place would allow,
they were supported by the Horse almost in the like manner, that they might not
be absolutely enclosed, or if they were, by doubling their Lines they might
cast themselves into a Ring, or Oval battle; whilst the Camp entrenched or
barrocado'd with chained Wagons was left on the right hand to secure the
approach on that part, though but slenderly guarded, and near thereunto was
placed a Regiment of the most experienced Horsemen for the security of the
King's Person, who would not be persuaded to reserve himself for a better Day,
by withdrawing from the Camp e're the battle was joined; so that now the great
Guns on either part begun to play furiously, though doing little damage, yet
the Turkish Squadrons advancing upon the first Charge, the Hungarian Horse gave
ground, and soon after broke their Array, which so discouraged the Footmen,
that they scarcely made any Resistance; but throwing away their Weapons, were
miserably slain; and in less than two hours space the whole Army was in Rout,
upon which the Turks following the Execution, not above 5000 escaped, all the
flower of the Nobility of that Kingdom being slain, and the King attempting to
escape, plunged with his Horse into a miry Place, where none coming to his
Assistance, he was stifled; nor did Tomoreus escape, but fell to augment the
number of the slain. After this fatal Blow was given to Hungary, which was
followed by innumerable Calamities, occasioned by Civil Dissentions. Solomon
entered Buda, and taking out of the Castle diverse Brazen Statues, placed there
by Matthias Corvinus, he departed to Constantinople, leaving the Kingdom in a
manner desolate, especially of its Nobility.

Thus Rashness (see) a mighty Ruin wrought,
And a free Kingdom to Subjection brought,
Which almost ever since has Groaned with War,
And hides more slain than in it the living ar'.
A Description of the Battle of Pavye, fought between Francis the French King,
and Charles Duke of Burbon, Charles de Lenoy, and the Marquess of Picara,
Generals for Charles the Fifth, Emperor of Germany.
THE French and Imperialists contending for the Sovereignty of Italy with
various Fortunes, and Francis the French King endeavoring to recover the
Duchy of Millain, the Duke of Burbon, Charles Lanoy Vice Roy of Naples, and
the Marquess of Piscara drew out an Army to oppose his proceedings, so that
after some time spent in training their Soldiers, and putting them in order,
it came to a pitched Field, and the Generals exhorting their Soldiers to do
their utmost Endeavors to gain Honor and Fame; the great Ordnance began to
thunder on either part, but that of the French being on the lower Ground, had
much the Advantage, the shot whereof passing through the Ranks of the German
Horsemen greatly incommoded them, which the Commanders perceiving, drew their
battles closer, and after some doubtful fight (whilst the Battle had wandered
over the Field) came to a bloody Encounter on all hands, so that the slaughter
grew hot, and the Wings still charging each other, each Nation strove by all
possible means to express its Valor; for in this battle fought not only French
and Germans, but Spaniards, Italians, and Switzers, indifferently on either
side, being Mercenary Soldiers, and hired for pay, and especially the French,
for the Honor of their King, who spared not at once to give command and charge
the Enemy, ranging through the fiercest attack, as knowing that if he lost that
Battle, it would be hard for him to escape; nor were the black Battalion of
Almayns (fighting on the Part of the King) less diligent in charging the
Switzer; so that one party engaging after another, they fought in the end in
all parts; so that the field was in a trice covered with the bodies of the
slain, and so eager were they to shed blood, that they minded not as yet the
taking of Prisoners on either side, by reason of which many men of Note were
slain that might have been made Prisoners; and amongst others Solice, whose
Horse being slain under him, and he oppressed with Armor, would have yielded
to the Captain of the Squadron of Horse that fought on that part, but a certain
Spaniard, envying the Horse should have the Ransom of so Noble a Prisoner, bent
his Harquibuss against his Breast and killed him on the Place; also Tremoville,
an other great Captain that had in his time won many great Victories, was shot
upon the like account; and Galeazo Sansenerino was slain in the Kings sight: so
that the Imperialists pressing on, (as having brought their whole strength into
the Field) many Gallant men were slain, and especially of the Horse, who were
for the most part in the heart of the battle, sustaining not only the Charge of
Horse against Horse, but frequently of the Footmen who flanked them, so that
the shot flying like hail, a great number were overwhelmed, Men and Horses
struggling together for Life, and many being dismounted were trampled to death;
so that it frequently happened, that the Front of the Battle was so barrocaded
with the slain, that neither Party could well advance to break into the
Squadrons, especially those on Horseback; and now the Switzers overcharged,
began to give ground, in striving to restrain which, the Lord Bonevet was
slain, and the King's Guard being miserably cut off with the shot of the
Footmen, he was left almost void of Succor, to the fury of the Enemy, and
many who loved their Lives dearer than their Honor left him, and scattered in
all parts, which the King perceiving, and that it was now but too apparent that
the battle went against him, having fought courageously, and done all that
could be expected from a great a Cptain; he labored to get from amongst his
Enemies; but being surrounded by the Horsemen of diverse Nations, though they knew
not directly who he was, yet supposing him a Person of Note, they pressed hard
upon him, nor did he forget himself, though he was forsaken by his Guard, but
continually wheeling his Horse to avoid the thickest of his Pursuers, defended
himself with his Sword, both giving and taking diverse Wounds; but whilst he
attempted a Bridge that passed over a Watercourse or small Rivolet, his Horse
was thrust in with a Pike, falling immediately down, in which fall he was much
bruised; so that he bled in abundance, lying at the same time with his Leg
under the Horse, and not able to relieve himself, when one Didaco de Aebilla,
and John Orbieta a Biscaian, coming in, and not well knowing him in that
Condition, shook their Swords over him, and willed him to yield, or he was a
dead man; but whilst he disdained to reply, or at least to discover himself,
Monsieur de La Motte came up, who knowing the King, kept off the Crowd, and
relieving him from the misery he lay in, required him to yield himself to the
Duke of Burbon, whom he said was at hand, but that duke, having revolted from
the King, whose Feudetary he was he grew angry, and in a chafe at his very
Name, fiercely replying, No, but call me hither Lenoy, who in the end being
sought for in all parts came of himself, and removed the great Crowd from about
the King, who pressed on all sides to see him.

It being known throughout the field that the King was made a Prisoner, the
Courage of those French that yet stood to it, altogether failed them, so that
the Imperialists crying every where Victory, they fled in all parts, as
likewise did the Switzers that sought on the Kings side, fearfully running into
the River Teniso, where being unskilful in swimming, they were drowned in whole
Troops; and those that remained on shore, although they threw down their Arms,
and begged for Life, were mostly slain, and all the Spoil of the Camp, besides
much rich Furniture of Horse and Armor taken, as likewise was Henry King of
Navar, and a great number of the French Nobility: and the Count of St. Paul
lying on the Ground wounded, a Spaniard cut off his Finger to take his Ring,
which he could not otherwise get off. As for the Duke of Alanson, who with a
Regiment of Horse he brought during the Battle, having stood a while a looker
on, he turned Tail and fled with those under his Command into France, to tell
the doleful News.

In this Battle, fought Anno 1523, upwards of 10000 men were slain, and as many
wounded and taken Prisoners, not reckoning those that were drowned in the River
Ten. so. As for the King, he soon after obtained his Liberty, in consideration
of his quitting claim to Millain, Naples, and Asti, as also his Superiority
over Artois and Flanders, paying moreover to the Emperor 120000 Crowns.

By this we see how Fortune deals with Kings,
Casting in doubtful chance all Earthly things.
He who an Army late in Triumph led,
Bereft of Power's a woeful Captive made.
A description of the Battle of Gabiniano, fought between Philbert Prince of
Orange, General for the Emperor Charles the Fifth, and Franaio a Captain of
the Florentines, Anno 1530.
THE Florentines having banished the Family of the Medic^'s, the Emperor
Charles the Fifth was so far offended thereat, that he caused his Forces under
the Command of Philbert Prince of Orange, straightly to besiege the City of
Florence in Italy, which being accordingly done, the Citizens resolved to send
for Farnaio, a Captain of theirs, who was abroad with some Troops on the
Frontiers, who by his falling into the Imperial Quarters whilst they sallied
out of the City, might be a means to raise the Siege, and so without further
delay they sent Han, a chosen Messenger, promising him great Rewards if he
prospered therein, which made him incontinently gather what Forces he could,
and advance with all imaginable Diligence and Secrecy, yet his Approach was
made known by the Imperial Espials. The Prince of Orange sent to Fabrico
Marmaldo, and Alexander Vitteli, who lay with their Regiments in the
Territories of Pisa, to haste to the Camp, yet take such a way that they might
follow in the Ear of Franaio's Troops, and fall upon him as they found their
Advantage, whilst himself with a detached Power would oppose him in the Front,
which accordingly happened after some skirmishing by the way in the Town of
Gabiniano; so that there the fury of the battle increasing, they fought on all
parts with great Fury, especially in the Marketplace, where Franaio leaping
from his Horse, and taking a Pike in his Hand, greatly encouraged his
Soldiers, nor failed Marmaldo to do the like, who casting his men in a thick
wedge, sustained the charge valiantly, whilst a part of Franaio's Foot
sheltring amongst the Chestnut Trees that grow thick toward the Wall of the
Town, poured in their shot like Hail, and as they saw it convenient, advanced
in parties, and having camisado'd the Enemy, as soon retired; which the Prince
of Orange (who fought on Horseback) perceiving, pressed on to dislodge them, to
whose Relief with a Troop of Horse, came Nicholas Mussio, a Greek of great
strength, with whom the Prince fought hand to hand, and although Mussu with his
Battel-Ax had bruised his Helmet, the Prince still pursued him with his Sword,
but entering too far amongst the Trees, he received two mortal Wounds by
Harquibuss shot, and fell from his Horse, and instantly died; (being stripped
by the Soldiers of his Cloth of Siver-Coat, and guilt Armor; whereupon his
Men were so discouraged that many of them fled away fearfully and unpursued; of
which Advantage Franaio laying hold, cried Victory, the better to hearten his
own Soldiers, and drawing his Troops close together, made a desperate charge
on those that yet stood firm, so that the Streets were covered with dead
Bodies, and the Channels murmured with Streams of Blood, nor had Victory failed
to have declared on his part, had not the Lansquenets of German Foot (who were
placed without the Town as a Battle of Succor) advanced and restored the
fight; for upon the flying of Rusales, a Colonel of Horse, with those under
his Command, the News was carried to the Camp before Florence, that the Prince
was slain, and his Army routed, but these fresh Forces coming on and renewing
the fight with great fury, the Florentines, after they had disputed Street by
Street, and House by House with the Imperials, found themselves too weak to
make any further resistance; so that Franaio, and Paul his Lieutenant, after
they had for many hours defended a strong House, and from thence with their
shot and Wildfire overthrown many of their Enemies, finding the battle
inevitably lost, yielded themselves to Marmaldo, when being brought into his
Presence armed as they were taken, he said to Franaio in a great Rage, And did
you think when you hanged up my Drummer against the Law of Arms, it would have
been my Fortune to have had you in my Power? To which Franaio without the least
show of fear or dejection replied, This is the chance of War, and the like may
also befall you, serving in the War; but if you take my Life, you shall gain by
my Death neither Profit, Honor, or Praise: yet Marmaldo having caused him to
be disarmed, wounded him with his Sword in the Throat, and left him to the
Soldiers to be dispatched, who incontinently slew him. Nor fell there in this
Encounter less than 2000 men, being the more memorable for that the two
Generals were slain, with many more of Note; upon News of which defeat of their
Forces, the Florentines yielded up the City, having defended it to the last
Extremity, leaving no unclean thing un-eaten; whereupon the Emperor deprived
them of their Francises, and made Alexander d' Medicis (base Son of Lawrence d'
Medicis) Duke of Florence, and of all the Countries depending thereon.

Thus one Succesless Battle Florence lost,
And a free State with servile Bondage cro'st,
Made Italy's chief Garden droop her Head,
As if her sragrant Flowers had all been dead.
A Description of the Memorable Battle of Cheresoles, fought in Peimont between
Alphons, Marquess of Guisto, General for Charles the Fifth, Emperor, and
France Duke of Anghien, General for Francis the French King, Anno 1544.
FRancis Duke of Anghien; with a great Power laving Siege to Carignano, (...)
strong Town in Peimont, Alphons, Marque^ of Guisto, Governor of that Province
for Charles the fifth, Emperor of Germany^ thought it highly concerned him to
hinde^ so important a Place from falling into the Hands of the French, and
thereupon drawing his Forces into a Body, he resolved to raise the Siege at the
hazard of a battle; no^ was not many days before the Armies confronted each
other, and began the fight (after they were arranged in battle array) with
their Cannon, and thereupo^n the Squardrons of Horse moved with great Courage;
the first that charged being the Horsemen of Thermes and Balleone, which charge
they maintained with so much Valor, that many were slain on either part, and a
great many borne to the Ground with their Lances, who for the most part were
trodden to death by the Horses, so that they soon came to use their Swords and
Battel-Axes; but Thermes at length bending his Forces upon the Italian
Footmen, was beaten from his Horse, and taken Prisoner by a common Soldier,
nor could Baleone's Wing (by reason of its being much inferior in number) long
resist the French men at Arms; so that many in that sharp conflict were slain,
and amongst them Julio Azzo, Son to the Prince of Tuderto and Baleone, having
his Horse slain under him, himself at the same time wounded, hardly escaped
being taken Prisoner; but the battle under the Command of Raimond de Cordona
and Seisneich had better fortune, for charging upon the Grevers, a sort of
Soldiers brought up in the Territories of Geneva, they so plied them with
Harquibuss-shot, that they put their Battle into much disorder, and won from
them the Ground they had a long time maintained; as likewise a Cottage that
sheltered them from the shot of the other Wing, with some pieces of Ordnance;
nor was it effected without great slaughter on either side, so that a Troop of
Horsemen were immediately sent to succor them, lest they should be all cut
off. In this Encounter Monsiew Destro and Charles Dross, Colonels of Horse,
were slain, as also Monsieur de Assier, a young Gentleman of great hope; for
the Spaniard, desirous to revenge old Wrongs, pressed furiously upon the
Frenchmen in this part of the battle, insomuch that they obliged them to
retire with great slaughter, even to the Gates of Carmagnola, and at the same
time the German Foot, who had lain upon the Ground to avoid the shot o^ the
great Ordnance, rose up and set forward to the battle, and Aliprando their
Commander going some paces before them, challenged out Monsieur de Mole, a
Captain of the French, to fight him i^ single Combat, which after being
accepted, both Captains mounted, and running furiously together, fell both of
them grievously wounded, one in the Eye, and the other in the Cheek, and
thereupon the Soldiers rushing together to their rescue, great slaughter
ensued; for Aliprandoe's Regiment, that joined as the Advance-guard, was not so
suddenly reinforced as intended, which in the end being over-matched by the
men at Arms, made them wheel off, which did not a little discourage their
Fellows, who suddenly coming on, had their flank left open to the shot of the
main battle, and those Horse that wheeled off, (being charged upon as flyers,
although the Marquess labored to make them face about, finding no place amongst
the Squadrons to make their retreat good) entered amongst the Ranks of the
German foot, which put them into great Confusion, for finding their battle was
behind the Ensigns, they brake quite through, and the French likewise pressing
on, got in at the breach, making great slaughter, especially of the hindermost
of those that fled, and when the Switzers who stood over against the Italians,
perceived this wavering, as likewise the slaughter of the Germans, they
likewise fell upon them with great fury, neglecting the Italians, with whom it
was expected they would have engaged; so that they who before were hard enough
put to it by the Gascoins and old Switzers, who fought in their front, and
weakened by the breaking in of their own Horse, (the French Horse likewise
charging them in the Rear) were not able to withstand the fresh charge, but
their Captains being most slain, and their Ensigns thrown down, turned their
backs and fled; yet being hotly pursued, they were most or them slain, and
amongst them diverse men of great Note, viz. Vulcain, Son to the Earl of
Furstemberg, Michael Preusinger, Lieutenant to Brannor, Scaliger, Antonya Vrste
a Captain of Great Fame, Hildebrand Tunnie, Balthazar Chaldese, James Figero,
Matrice Bursea, Adam Brall, and the Baron of Grimstein: and Aliprando near dead
of his Wound, was found amongst the dead bodies and taken Prisoner; and when
the Italian foot perceived the Germans broken and dispersed, and that the
Horsemen had left the Field, they made good their retreat, and with little loss
got about Midnight to Asti, whither the Horsemen were gotten before them, and
soon after came the Marquess with his Helmet much bruised and battered, and
shot with a Harquibus-shot into the Knee, so that the Victory was entirely left
to the French. And of the 40000 that were in the Field on both sides, 12000 are
acounted to be slain, whereupon Carignan^ surrendered to the Duke of Haghein.

Thus Peimont sees the blood of Foreign Lands
Reeking in Streams upon her thirsty Sands,
Such is the Fate where cruel War Commands.
A Description of the Battle of Lochen, fought in Saxony, between Charles the
Fifth, Emperor of Germany, and John Fredrick, Dake of Saxony, on the twenty
fourth of April, Anno Dom. 1547.
THE Emperor Charles the Fifth being displeased with diverse Princes of the
Empire, and the misunderstanding growing daily greater, they thought it the
surest way to arm on all parts, and stand upon their Guard, which making the
Emperor suppose it the best way to fight them separate, he pursued John
Fredrick Duke of Saxony upon his return into his own Country, by such speedy
marches that the Advaunt-guard of his Army attacked the Saxons before they
expected they were arrived in those parts, which created much Fear and
Consternation; yet maintaining only a kind of a flying fight till the gross
battalions came up, the Duke had leisure to put his Troops in Order, and formed
his Battle in this wise. viz. He commanded the Footmen of the Earl of
Bichenlinghen, in whom he reposed the greatest trust, and the Horsemen of John
Ponecan and Gaugulph of Eslenhen, to take their Stations in the front, ordering
them that if they charged they should retire, and avoid, as much as in them
lay, entering into a hot dispute, till the signal was given to assure them the
other Battles were in a readiness; then he cast 6000 footmen into two
Squadrons, and supported them with 500 Horsemen, riding himself from Rank to
Rank, to give necessary Orders and Directions for what was wanting, placing
another 2000 Horse as a Wing to cover the Foot on the Right side, and so
closing his Battle to prevent the Enemies breaking in, he stood in array to
expect the Event, whilst the Emperor, with whom was the King of Romans, and
the Great duke of Alva, placed in the Vaunt-guard of his Army 600 Lances, with
600 Hungarian Horsemen, 700 Italian Horsemen, and 100 Harquibusiers on
Horseback, then he divided them into three Troops, the Hungarians he placed on
the Right wing, the Germans on the left, and the Italians in the middle, and of
the rest of the Forces he made his battle, dividing it into three Squadrons, of
whom he committed one to the charge of the King of Romans, but the others he
led himself, the one consisting of 700 Horsemen, and the other of 1000, part
Lances, and part Harquibuses, commanding the whole Army to advance in such
order that the front might be broad and extended, that so they might prevent
being enclosed; and thus-both Armies being in array, and the Duke not
perceiving it commodious to retire, proceeded with a moving Oration to
encourage his Men by putting them in mind of the Prowess and Valor of their
Ancestors, and exhorting them to fight like men for their Liberties, Lives,
Wives, Children, and Country, and that for his part he would not be wanting to
fight or succor as occasion should require it. Nor was the Emperor wanting to
encourage his Soldiers to the like effect, so that now there being nothing
wanting but the Signal to join battle, that was not long delayed, for the
Trumpets suddenly sounding, the Imperial Battle moved with great swiftness, but
the Horse coming into dirty and slippery Ground, were so mired, that the
Ear-guard was forced to give back till the Advaunt guard had passed it, lest by
pressing on they should have broken the Array, and caused Confusion and
Disorder to have ensued, which gave the Saxons Opportunity to charge the Front
before the Rear could come up, insomuch that a hot and desperate fight ensued,
for the battle being begun in the Right-wing, the Saxons poured in their shot
like Hail, and had made great slaughter, had not the Italian and Hungarian
Light-Horse-men come in, and charged them in another part; which for a time
allayed their fury: whilst in another part the men at Arms of Naples, and the
German Harquibusiers sorely pressed their main battle, so that the
Advaunt-guard became open, and began to scatter, although the Duke labored all
that in him lay to keep his men in their Ranks, and to admonish them with Words
and Actions to do their utmost to support his Honor; yet fear had so possessed
them, that they could not be kept in their Battles, but began incontinently to
disrank; so that the Imperialists thrusting into their Array, brought them in a
short time into great Distress and Confusion; whereupon the Duke finding the
Day lost, used what Industry he could to make an orderly retreat into the
Neighboring Wood, but by reason his Array was broken, the Imperialists entered
with him, making great slaughter of his men, and pressed so furiously upon him,
that although he stoutly defended himself, yet at length he was taken Prisoner
by Hippalito a Venetian, and disarmed, as likewise were a great number of his
men, and some prime Commanders.

In this Battle 2000 foot were slain, as likewise 800 Horsemen, and 700 wounded
on the part of the Saxons, but of the Germans the slain exceeded not 500; there
were likewise taken 42 Ensigns, with all the Plate, Jewels, Baggage, and
Furniture of the Camp, though the Saxons made a kind of a marching or running
fight for the space of fifteen miles, in all continuing about eight hours; and
after this Victory all the Country of Saxony submitted to the Emperors
Pleasure, as soon after did most of the other Estates and Principalities that
combined to withstand and oppose him.

Thus Saxony in her own Confines pressed,
Through one great loss is many years distressed,
Lab^ring with War till Peace at last gave rest.
A Description of the Memorable battle of Muscle-borough-field, fought in
Scotland between Edward Seimour Duke of Somerset, and James Hamilton Earl of
Arran, Regents of England and Scotland, Anno 1547.
A Great difference arising between the two Nations, upon the Scots refusing
(as it had been agreed upon in the days of Henry the Eighth,) to give their
young Queen Mary (sole Heiress to the Crown of Scotland) to Edward the Sixth,
King of England, etc. The English under the leading of the Duke of Somerset,
and other Nobles entered that Kingdom, resolving by War to prosecute them for
their Obstinacy, and oblige them if possible, to the performance of what they
(without any Color or Reason) had refused; whereupon on the third of
September, Anno 1547, the Lord Regent passed the Tweed with an Army consisting
of 10000 foot, of which 600 were Harquibuses, 4000 men at Arms and Demilances,
with 2000 light Horsemen, of whom 200 were Harquibusiers mounted, and 1300
Pioneers, the Train of Artillery consisting of fifteen great pieces, besides a
Fleet of sixty five Vessels, whereof a great Gally, and thirty four Ships were
well appointed for War, the rest being Victuallers and Tenders, and on the
ninth of September encamped within two Miles of the Scottish Army, under the
command of the Earl of Arran, who the next Morning dislodged, as likewise did
the English, and advanced toward each other, though the former had but a bad
welcome, for some of the English Ships riding at Anchor in the River, let fly
so soon as they came within reach of their shot, and killed a Captain, together
with twenty five Soldiers, which made the Battalion of Archers commanded by
the Earl of Argyle retreat, nor could they be persuaded to advance, which made
the whole Army change the intended course by marching more Southwardly, nor
stayed they till they had possessed themselves of the Hill called
Fauxside-Bray, which made the duke of Somerset, the English General, send some
Troops thither to secure the Hill, it being of great advantage to those that
possessed it, and so successful was he therein, that he procured in a short
time several pieces of Cannon to be mounted thereon, which afterward proved
very serviceable in battering the Enemies Ranks, and in the Emergency the
Council debated on Horseback what was to be done, as not having liesure
otherways to do it, and came to result this, viz. that the Lord Gray of Wilton,
Marshal of the Army, and Captain General of all the Horsemen should with his
band of Bulloiners and other Troops, to the number of 1800 Horsemen advance to
charge the Enemy in the Front, whilst Sir Ralph Vane and Sir Thomas Darcy,
Captains of the Pentioners and Men at Arms, together with the Lord Fitz-Walter
and his band of Demilances to the number of 1600 should be ready to support
him, that so by a furious charge they might break or disorder the thick front
of the Enemies Pikes; and although this was a hazardous undertaking, yet the
Captains disputed not the Order; [only the Lord Gray desired the General (that
if he should miscarry in the Enterprise) he would be good to his Wife and
Children] and so taking leave, he advanced to meet the Scots, who with no less
speed came on in so thick a Wedge, that it appeared very difficult, if not
impossible to pierce their Array, for the Earl of Angues, who commanded the
Vaunt-guard, had in his Battle 8000 Men, and four or five pieces of Cannon,
which served as a flank on his Right, and on his Left he had 400 Horse men, and
was supported with 10000 Highlanders, and in the Rear-ward was the Earl of
Huntly with 8000 Scots, and 4000 Irish Archers, who served as a Wing unto them
both, being furnished likewise with Ordnance, as in the other battle; nor was
this all, for the English had the difficulty of a great Slough or miry Ditch to
struggle with in their Passage, which not only obliged them to break their
Ranks, but mited diverse of them that were not skilled in leaping, yet
surmounting these they came to a furious charge, insomuch that although at the
first onset the battle was not broken, yet it swaied and gave back to
Admiration, so that the English gained Ground apace, but the Lord Marshal
finding he was not at that time capable of forcing their Ranks, he made a
softly retreat toward the Hill, that they might disrank to follow him, and he
thereby have an opportunity to give a second charge before they could fall into
order, in which retreat he lost twenty five of his men, and had diverse wounded,
many of them Persons of Quality, as the Lord Generals Son, and Sir Thomas
Darcy, etc. Nor did they fail to lay hold on the Kings Standard, borne by Sir
Andrew Flammock, but it was so well defended, that they only broke the Staff,
and carried away the nether end; but the English Commanders having rallied
their Troops, and by moving Orations dissipated the fear the late slaughter
occasioned, and being reinforced, Peter Meucasa, Captain of a Company of
Harquibusiers on foot, drew up in the front of the Enemies battle, and was
seconded by Peter Gamboa a Spanish Captain, who commanded 200 Harquibusiers on
Horseback, who with their shot made such slaughter, that the Scots durst not
advance, and by that means the English Archers had time to march on the
Right Hand of our footmen, and feather them with their flights of Arrows, and
the great Ordnance playing transverse within Musket Shot, and the footmen who
had been obscured by the Horse, advancing in good array, the Scots began to
shrink together, though they were far superior to the English in number, and
quickly losing all Courage, betook themselves to open flight, their General the
Earl of Arran flying foremost, nor did Angues stand to it, but followed with
great Celerity; so that the rout was by this time in all parts, when as the
English crying, they fly, they fly, followed the chase with great slaughter,
the miserable Scots casting away their Weapons, and crying out for Mercy, which
in the first fury or the pursuit the Soldiers being hot upon Execution, few of
them obtained, so that our men using their own broad Swords, (which they had
scattered) against them, 13003 of them are reputed to be slain, and of Note the
Lord of Loghemworth, the Lord Fleming, the Master of Greym, the Master of
Arskin, and of the better fort about 1600, and 1500 were taken Prisoners, the
chief of which were the Lord Huntly, Lord Chancellor of the Kingdom, the Lords
of Yester, Hobby, and Hamilton, the Captain of Dun-Bar, the Lord Wimms, and a
Brother to the Earl of Casselles. It is further reported, that many perceiving
the pursuit grew hot, and that they could not escape it, fell down amongst the
slain, and counterfeiting themselves dead, found means when the Pursuers were
past, by the shelter of the Night to get into the Woods and adjacent Towns, and
so secured themselves from the destroying Swords. As for their Camp, Baggage,
Ammunition, and all of that kind, they fell into the Hands of the English, as
likewise did many considerable Towns and strong holds, but as for the young
Queen, she was before hand conveyed secretly into France.

The Scots grown obstinate thus dearly paid;
Because the happy Union they delayed,
Which Heaven at last, more kind than they, brought on,
And made the long contending Nations one.
A Description of the Battle of Dreux, fought in Normandy, between Lewis of
Burbon, Prince of Conde, and Aeneas Montmorency, Constable of France, Anno 1562.
GReat Troubles arising in France about Religion, soon after the Reformation
spread wide in Christendom, amongst others, who took up Arms to assert and
maintain it, was Lewis of Burbon, Prince of Conde, to oppose whom, Aeneas
Montmorency drew out the French King's Forces, and hasted into Normandy with
all speed; yet not so secretly but that the Prince with whom was Chastillion
the Admiral, had notice of his approach, and thereupon consulted with his
Associates what was best to be done, who together, all things being weighted,
resolved to give the Constable Battle, though the Catholic Army much
overmatch'd the Hugonots in number of Foot, consisting of 26000, whereas that
of his own was scarce 11000; yet he had the advantage in Horse by almost a
1000; so that both Armies by this time being encamped within sight of each
other; the Morning following the Prince drew into the Field and ranged his
Battle, placing his Horsemen, to the number of 4000 in the Vaunt-guard, and
himself led the Battle with Rechfocault, taking to him a Squadron of light
Horsemen, led by Courays; and posting on the other side, the Cornets commanded
by Monoy and Aveller, with certain Reysters or German Horse, committing the
care of the Vaunt-guard to the Admiral, with whom he joined the Prince of
Porcien, supported by other Troops of Horse; then followed a battalion of
German Foot consisting of 4000, supported by 500 loose shot called Enfans
Perdus, who, as the occasion requires, are to march before the Battalion as the
forlorn hope; then another strong Battalion of 23 Ensigns, consisting of French
Footmen, whose charge it was to manage and guard the Ordnance, being secured
in the Flank by a Wing or Party of German Horse; and in this Array he marched
with a square Battle.

The Constable perceiving the Hugonot Army by the posture it was drawn into,
resolved to give Battle, drew out likewise, comitting to the Duke of Guise the
Right Wing of the Advant-guard, and next in order he placed the Battalion of
the Spanish Foot, and the old French Soldiers, with four pieces of Canon; of
the Left Wing the Marshal of St. Andrews had the Charge, and was guarded on the
one side with a Battalion of Foot, and on the other with a Squadron of Horse;
and the main Battle principally was composed of 17 Ensigns of French Foot, and
22 Ensigns of Switzers the Constable himself commanded, enclosing 18 pieces of
great Ordnance; and thus stood the Battles of the Catholics in a great length
or depth, and the Battles of the Hugonots confronted them, when Conde giving
the Signal, and Curay going before with his light Horsemen, charged upon the
Switzers, where he found them left naked of Horsemen, and with great fury
broke in amongst them, making a considerable slaughter of them, though they at
first, by the help of their Ordnance, made a stout resistance, and the strength
of their own Weapons, but the shot flying thick as hail in their faces, they
were soon obliged to give ground, and soon after not being able to sustain the
charge of the Horsemens Lances, they broke their array, and scattered, leaving
their Ordnance behind them unguarded, whilst those that had routed them ranged
with great slaughter through the bloody Attacks; not did the Admiral delay to
charge the Constables battle, whilst the Reysters did the like upon Avelle's
Horse, who were to support it, but this beginning of good Success and Promise
of Victory lasted not long, for though the Constable was wounded and taken in
the Charge, his Battle being near over-set, yet Avelle perceiving the Princes
foot lest naked, broke in amongst them, and put them far and near to the rout;
so that not longer being able to make resistance in the disorder they were in,
they fled toward the Village of Blinvil, at what time the Duke of Guise coming
in with a strong reserve, disordered the rest of the foot that yet stood firm,
as not having been charged, though in entering amongst their Ranks, many of his
Horsemen, together with their Horses, were slain, so that Avelle who kept his
Troops firm, being returned from the rout of the foot, and perceiving the
Prince's Horse disordered in pursuit of the Switzers, he broke in, so that the
Prince himself was wounded, overborn and taken Prisoner by him, and his Troops
put to the flight, which was the only thing that put a stop to Victory's
declaring on the part of the Hugonots, and gave the Duke of Guise an
Opportunity to further his Advantage, yet the Admiral made great resistance,
laboring all that in him lay to restore the battle, in disputing for which the
Marshal of St. Andrews was slain, with diverse others of Note, and many were
wounded; yet the Admiral for want of Horse to second his Foot, was in the end
obliged to give ground, yet the fight continued bloody and doubtful, and
greater had been the slaughter, had not Night come and parted the Armies, who
otherwise, as men resolute, were resolved to have fought it out to the last
Extremity.

In the last Encounter (besides the Marshal of St. Andrews) were slain Monbrun,
Son to the Constable, the Lord Phinnes, the Grand Prior, and a Brother to the
Guise, Guire and Aenabault de' Brosses, with diverse others of Noble descent;
and amongst the wounded were the Dukes de Ama^^ and Nevers, who soon after died
of their Wounds, and many noble Prisoners were taken on either side, neither
having cause to boast of any advantage, for the slain computed to ten thousand,
were in a manner equally divided; and the battle parted by the Night as
aforesaid, the Admiral repaired with his Forces to Orleance, and the Duke of
Guise with those that were now under his command, to Paris.

Thus Night drew Curtains over the fatal Field,
To spare that Blood which yet remained unspill'd;
But calmed not their wild fury, for again
Grown big with War, the Captains take the Plain.
A Description of the Battle of Bassiack, fought in France between Henry Duke
of Anjou, Brother to, and Lieutenant General for Charles the Ninth, King of
France, and Lewis Prince of Conde, General of the Hugonot Army, Anno 1569.
ALthough the strengths of either party had been sufficiently tried, and France
yet reeked with Blood, yet it sufficed not the hot Spirits of the Leaders, but
they again drew out their Forces. The Catholics under the leading of the Duke
of An^ou, and the Hugonots under the leading of the Prince of Conde, and the
Admiral of Castillion, and after diverse Skirmishes the Forces on either part
increasing, though not half the Prince's Army were come up, Necessity obliging
him to engage, the fight began with great fury, but lasted not long before
Fortune declared against the Hugonots, for the Prince perceiving a great Troop
approaching to fight him at disadvantage with 4 or 500 Horse, he turned head to
charge them, till more of his For^es might come up, and gave a very hot charge;
upon the foremost pressing on with such fury, that he bore down and obliged to
retreat all that stood before him; but not being seconded as he expected, and
in hight of his Valor advancing too far, he found himself enclosed by the
Ranks of his Enemies, who laid upon him so forcibly, that having done all that
could be expected from true Valor, he was in the end beaten from his Horse,
sore bruised and wounded, where no timely succor coming in, he was constrained
to give place unto force; so that being bidden to yield by de Argence and
Monsieur Jean, upon their Promise to spare his Life, he surrendered himself, but
soon after being known, Montesquoin, a desperate fellow, contrary to Justice or
the Law of Arms, shot him dead with a Pistol: and thus ended the Great and
Warlike Conde, who with a handful of men for many years had resisted the power
of a potent Kingdom; but here ended not the misery, for his men understanding
he was dead, no longer kept the field, but were a great number of them
slaughtered in the pursuit.

During the battle, Dacier, the Prince's Lieutenant, and drawn his men, to the
number of 6000, out of Cognac, and, advertised that his General was engaged,
hasted by a great march toward Bassiack, but coming within a league of it, he
understood by those that fled, that the battle was lost, which caused him to
march toward Jarnac, but scarcely arrived there before the Catholic Troops
appeared, against whom he made head with much bravery, obliging them to recoil
in such a manner as gave him Opportunity to make his retreat good with small
loss, by passing Rivers, and cutting off Bridges, etc. to hinder the Horse that
hung upon his Rear.

The Admiral, and Dandelot his Lieutenant, perceiving the fight irreparably
lost, and the confusion in all places was great, retired with a small number of
the Nobility, shunning the greater number, the better to hinder the pursuit,
and so came to St Jean de Ae'ngly, where being advertised that the young
Princes of Navar and Conde were at Zaincles, they marched thither, and made
that the place of their Randezvouze, whither a great number of such as escaped
out of the battle resorted, and soon became a formidable Army, being joined by
those Troops that were not in the battle.

In this disaster were slain on the Hugonot Party, many of great Note, besides
the Prince As de la Tour, Chustebers, Portant, Chandenire, Mesauchere,
Brandanire, Besolones, Taberiere, Barette, Lay Mesleray, and about fifty
Gentlemen of lesser Note, for the heat of the battle fell upon the Horse, the
Foot scarcely coming to engage, though it went not unbloody on the other part,
for a great number of prime Men lost their Lives, especially in the quarter
where the Prince charged, yet the Prisoners (Protestants) were many, and
amongst them diverse of the Scottish Nation, who had engaged themselves as
Volunteers on the part of the Prince, the chief was Corbeson, Brother to the
Earl of Montgomery. As for the whole number of the slain it exceeded not 2000,
yet the winning the battle proved of great Importance to the Catholics, for
soon after they overrun Zantougevis, Anguemois, Limousin, and other Places of
Note, though thereby they gave way to the increase of the Hugonot Power, which
gathered to the Standard of Henry, the young Prince of Navar, whom they chose
their General, constituting at the same time the Admiral the Protector of his
Person; whereupon the War continued as hot as ever, and many great Battles were
fought with various success, nor ended it till after the death of Henry the
Third. Henry Prince, and afterward King of Navar, was Crowned King of France,
as being the next of the blood Royal.

Thus France the fate of Civil Discord found,
Which in her Bosom made a deadly Wound,
War raging through her Confines Terror yields,
Encumbring long her blood-bedabl'd Fields,
More Red with slaughter, then her Town's with Wine,
More Crimson Streams from Wounds, than from the Vine.
For still where Native Arms oppress the soil,
The Ground's made fat; with Blood the Rivers boil.
No Foes at Odds are swelled with so much Rage,
As when two kindred Hoast's fierce battle wage:
Nor need we to Pharsalian Plains retreat,
Nor fatal Mundas Field's nor Africks beat,
Where Roman Civil Hands in slaughter tired
Could not give Death those Lives their Rage desired,
Since Native Albion with like Ruin spread,
Yet mourns the Blood her mad-brain'd Sons have shead,
And drops sad Tears upon the mighty dead.
A Description of the famous battle or Sea Fight, commonly called the battle of
Lepanto, fought near the Gulf of that Name, between the Navy of the Christian
League, under the Conduct of Don John of Austrian, half Brother to Philip the
First, King of Spain, and Haly Bassa Commander in chief for Selimus the Second,
Emperor of the Turks, Anno 1572.
THE Turks under the Reign of Selimus, the Second of that Name, greatly
infesting the Seas, and riding triumphant as it were with a powerful Navy on
the Ocian; the Christian Princes, especially the King of Spain, the Pope, and
the Venetians, began to consider the great damage they had done, and what more
they were like to do them, if not curbed in time, which made them con^derate
and hasten out their Ships of War, that they might in Conjunction oppose the
growing Mischief, which meeting in the Fair or Bay of Messina on the Coast of
Sicily, the Admirals and the other prime Commanders called a Council to
consider what course was best to be observed, or what measure to be taken in
the management of the War against so powerful an Enemy, eneouraging each other
with an assured hope of Victory, if they could come to a fair and equal fight:
For the Venetians had sent thither 108 Galleys, six Galliasses, two great Ships
of extraordinary force, with diverse Galliots and Tenders, to which were joined
twelve of the Popes Galleys commanded by Collumnius, and with Don John of
Austria, General for Philip King of Spain, and Auria his Admiral, came 81
Galleys and other Vessels of Force, three of which appertained to the Knights
of Malta, nor were other Princes and States wanting to contribute to this
Expedition, viz. The Dukes of Florence, Savoy, and the Estate of Genoa, etc.
and in the Fleet, beside Mariners, were 20000 Persons, most of known and
approved Valor, a fifth part being of the Nobility and Gentry of Spain,
Venice, and Rome, etc. all gallantly accoutred and attended, the principal of
which were Franciscus Maria Prince of Vrbin, Alexande^ Farnesius Prince of
Parma, and Paulus Jordanus Vrsianus of the Honorable Family o^ the Roman
Vrsini; so that nothing being wanting but an Enemy to contend witha^ Venerius
the Venetian Admiral in Council pressed the General, that for as much as they
were assured that the Turkish Fleet was in the Gulf of Lepanto, speedy Orders
might be taken to sail thither, and give them battle with the first advantage,
which being agreed upon by all the Commanders, the Fleet was martialed in the
following order, viz. In the Right-wing consisting of 53 Galleys, Auria the
Spanish Admiral was placed, in the Left wing, with a like number of Galleys.
Barbadicus an experienced Commander of the Venetians took his place, and in the
middle the General placed himself with a Squadron of 70 Galleys, Collumnius and
Venerius commanding the rest of the Fleet on his Right and Left, and in this
Order they set forward with a prosperous Gale.

Whilst these Preparations of the Christians were in hand, the Turks had notice
of ^ll that had passed, and calling a Council ^n the Bay or Gulf of Lepanto,
where they ^ay, they held a long debate whether they ^ould give the Christians
battle, or decline ^t, but at length those that were against it ^eing over
powered by the number of Voi^es of the contrary Opinion, they came to a ^esult
that the Fleet should be put in order ^o receive them, which at the Command ^f
Haly Bassa, General of the Land Forces, and great Admiral, was done in this
manner so soon as they came out of the Gulf, viz. The middle battle consisting
of about 60 Galleys, was to be conducted by Haly Bassa, assisted by Partau
Bassa, attended by Agan, Master of the Turks Arsenal; and the rest, in all, to
the number of 350 Galleys and Ships of War, were disposed much in the same
posture as the Christian Fleet, viz. The Right wing commanded by Mahomet Bey,
consisting of 50 Galleys, to whom many experienced Sea Captains were joined.
The Left wing was committed to the charge of Vluzales, Viceroy of Argiers, an
old experienced Pirate, consisting of ^ Galleys, attended on by Cariolo and
Arab^ his two Sons, and strongly manned with Pirates and Sea Rovers. In the
Rearward was placed Amurath Dragut with 30 Galleys attended on by diverse small
Vessels. And in these Orders both Fleets being arrainged, (though indeed the
Turks were deceived in the number of the Christians, by reason the Left wing of
their Fleet lay under the Island, and could not be well discerned) the day
being fair and calm, about noon they fiercely engaged with such Shouts as made
the Ocian Ring, which notwithstanding wa^ soon exceeded by the thunder of the
Cannons, nor was God wanting to favor the Christians by the sudden vering of
the Wind, which drove the Smoke of the Ordnance and Vollies of small shot in
the faces of the Turks, so that after a long, bloody and obstinate fight of
four hours, the Turkish Admiral being slain, his Gally taken, and upward of 40
others taken, burnt, and sunk, Victory began to declare on the part of the
Christians, but the Turkish Commanders fearing the Anger of Selimus if they
should return vanquished, fought like men in despair, yet true Valor
prevailing, after an obstinate fight of six hours, all the prime Commanders,
except Vluzales Carragosa being either slain, wounded, or taken Prisoners; and
he perceiving the battle irreparably lost, shifted with his Squadron, and
getting clear with about thirty or forty Galleys, fl^d into the Bay of Lepanto,
leaving the rest in fl^mes, or miserably torn and disabled, to fall into the
hands of the Christians, who pursued him as far as with safety they thought
convenient, and then returned to take the Spoil; where it was a dreadful
Spectacle to behold the Sea colored with Blood, and thousands of dead and
dying Bodies floating upon the Waves, together with Masts, Tackle, pieces of
Ships, Galleys, and such Weapons as were subject to float; as also the Cries of
the wounded, and the flaming Vessels, which made the Sea seem on a blaze.

As for the exact number of the Infidels that perished in this fight, it is not
known; but modest Writers, and amongst others, Antenius Gnanaerius in his
History of this War, makes mention of no less than 32000, and amongst them
these of Note, viz. Haly Bassa General, Mahomet Bey Governor of Alexandria,
Cassanes Son to Barbarossa, the Piratical King of Argires, together with his
Son Mulaune Governor of Mytilene, Giador Governor of Chi^s, Cassambeus
Governor of Rhodes, Provi Agga, Captain of Naupp^^um, Mustapha Zelibi great
Treasurer to the Grand Seignior, Caracoza and others of Note; and amongst those
that were taken Prisoners, the chiefest of Note were Achmet and Mahomet, Sons
to Haly the General, and Nephews to Selymus, and Mechmet Bey Governor of
Eubaea. with 3500 of lesser Note; of the Turkish Galleys 161, as also sixty
Galliots and other small Vessels were taken, and upward of forty burnt or sunk
during the Fight.

This Important Victory to Christendom, which put a stop to the Turkish
Incroachment, being entirely gained; Don John, Venerius and Collumnius, coming
on board, the Admiral kindly embraced with all the Endearments of Reciprocal
Love, and afterward in a most Christian Manner, falling on their Knees,
ascribed not the Victory to the arm of Flesh, out to him who is the God of
Battles, returning hearty Thanks to the great and wise Creator and Disposer of
all things, for giving them so signal and important a Victory over the Enemies
of his Name, in Imitation of whose pious Example the whole Fleet, as well
Soldiers and Mariners, as Officers and Commanders, did the like.

In this bloody and dismal Fight were slain no less than 7566 Christians of all
Nations the Principal Persons were John and Barn dinus of the honorable Family
of Cordona in Spain, Horatio Caraffa, Ferentes Bisballus, Horatius and
Virginius Orsini, Noble Romans; and of the Venetian Nobility, Agustinus
Barbadicus, Benedictus Superantius, Vincentius Quirinus, Johanes Lauretanus,
Marinus Contarenus, Catharinus Maleperta, Georgius Andreas Barbadious, Marcus
Antonius Landus, Francisous Bonus, Hieronemas Contarenus, Antonius Poscaligus,
and Hierom Venerius, all of the Order of the Senators; with many of the Spanish
Nobility not mentioned by Name. The wounded of Note, were Venerius the Venetian
Admiral, John de Austrae, Paulus Forano the Count de San Fiora Marcus Molini,
Thomasius de Medici, Martello Reverio, Biffoli Marteuno, Guicardini Spina,
Mazingi Juli^, Maldini Guianovo Magnali, Johanes Marea Pucci, Toraboni
Figliazi, Fredricus E^ecello, and Gerardo; but not many of them dyed of their
Wounds, they being mostly given with Arrows

After this Renowned Victory was obtained, and the account thereof taken, the
Generals and great Commanders assembled in Council, to consider what was
further to be done, and ended in this Determination, viz. That Don John of
Austria, with the Spanish Fleet, and Collumnius, (or as some call him)
Gollonia, with the Popes Galleys should return to Mesina in Sicily, by reason
Winter approaching, it was no fit Season to besiege any Place of Importance.
But Venerius the Venetian Admiral, repairing his Navy, kept the Mediteranean,
and won many strong Holds from the Turks, both on the European and Asian
shores: and so vexed was Selymus, upon the news of this Defeat, that in a
sullen Humor he shut himself up for three days, not admitting any to speak with
him but those that brought him Necessaries; and then in a Rage, passed a bloody
Decree, to Massacre all the Christians in his Dominions, which had been
wickedly put in Execution, had not the Grand Vizier laid many Reasons before
him to divert him from it; nor have the Turks to this Day repaired the Loss,
but remain inconsiderable to what they formerly were at Sea, saying, That God
has divided the World by giving to the Christians the Sea. and to the Turks the
Land. Turkish Hist. in the Life of Selymus the Second.

Thus were the Proud Insulting Turks subdued,
Who had so many Lands with Slaughter strewn,
Whilst Grecian shoars beheld the woeful Wrack,
And trembled at so great a Ruin's crack.
Toe Sea too Blushed with an unwonted stain,
Shrinking to see her self the shambles of the slain.
A Relation of the Battle of St. Quintines, fought in France, between Aeneas
Montmorency, High Constable of France, and General for Henry the Second French
King, and Philbert Duke of Savoy, Lieutenant General for Philip King of Spain,
Anno 1577.
THE War being proclaimed between France and Spain, Philbert Duke of Savoy,
with an Army of 13000 Horse, an 40000 Foot, and 8000 Pioneers, laid Siege to
the Important Town of St. Quintines in Vermandois, to the Relief of which, the
French King sent Montmorency High Constable of France, with an Army consisting
of 4000 Horse, and 20000 Foot, with all the flower of the French Nobility, who
served as Volunteers in this Enterprise, and with him he drew a Train of twenty
pieces of Ordnance; when being come within fifteen Miles of the Place, he
detached 2000 Horse, causing them to advance and find out the Foard o^ the
River, which they must pass about three Miles on this side the Town, which they
accordingly did, but found it so narrow, that only six Horse a Breast could
pass it; not was it abandoned bnt defended on the other Bank by a Regiment of
Spanish Harquibusiers, who upon the approach of the gross of the French Army
were reinforced with some Troops of Horse, who kept their station
notwithstanding the Canon played against them with great Fury; but it was not
long ever the Duke of Savoy understanding the French Army was much Inferior to
his in number; calling a Council, it was after some Debate resolved therein,
that the French should not give themselves the trouble o^ passing the River as
they intended, and for that purpose were laving over Bridges: But that leaving
a sufficient number to block up the Town, the rest of the Army should
immediately pass over and give them Battle, whereupon Count Egmont was
commanded to lead the way with a 1000 Horse, Burgundians and Spaniards,
seconded by Ernes^^^ and Ericus Dukes of Brunswick with 2500 Horse, after whom
followed Count Mansfield with 800 Dragoons, and Count Horn with a 1000 Men at
Arms, seconded by a 1000 Horse, detached from diverse Troops; and in this manner
they forced the Passage without much Resistance, and ranged themselves in
Battle array, for Montmorency rather desiring to put a Supply into the Town,
than come to a Battle, only kept them busy with light Skirmishes, whilst the
Parties he had appointed for that purpose passed the River at greater
Distances; nor did he altogether fail herein, for 300 resolute Frenchmen did
enter: but finding the gross of the Spanish Army press upon him, he by little
and little began to retire toward the Hills, Skirmishing in the mean time to
retard their March, especially with the Light house, who sought to delay him
till the gross of the Army came up: But finding in the end that his Retreat
might prove disadvantageous to him, as not having any means of escaping a
Battle, if the Spanish General would oblige him to it, he put his Army in
Array, resolving to try the Fortune of War; which he had scarce done before the
Count of Egmont gave a furious Charge upon the advanced Parties of French
Horse, and being seconded by the Dukes of Brunswick, Count Home, Count
Mansfield, and Colonel Horckstrate, after a sharp dispute, wherein the French
behaved themselves with much Resolution and Bravery; fresh Troops of Spanish
Horse still coming in, and much slaughter made, Montmorency was obliged to
suffer his Horse men to Retreat to the Body of Foot, who casting themselves
close together in a thick Squadron, stood firm, and strongly sustained the
Charge, making it a bloody and doubtful Fight, which the Duke of Savoy
perceiving, poured in fresh Troops to prevent the retreat of those that were
almost wearied out, commanding Count Egmont to renew the Charge upon the Foot
men with greater fury, sending other Troops at the same time to charge the
Horse, that they might not have leisure to put themselves into Array; so that
the Frenchmen continually having fresh Forces to contend withal, overpowred
with number, and wearied, especially the Horsemen, betook themselves to flight,
abandoning the Foot to the mercy of the Enemy, so that a great slaughter
ensued, the Fight being maintained in a flying manner over the Plains, so that
on the part of the French there were slain to the number of 6000, and of note
John Duke of Anguen, Brother to the King of Navar, Vicecount Touraine Nephew to
the Constable, the Lords Campodenary, Eyrrie, Galan, Plenot and Gelot, with
many others, the Horse consisting mostly of Nobility, the wounded were about
2000, and of note Montmorency Constable of France, the Dukes of Longeville and
Montpensire, the Marshal of St. Andrews, Lewis Brother to the Duke of Mantua,
Vasey, Courtain, and Roche du Maine, the Rhinegrave, the Count Rochfocault, the
Lords Obigney, the two Birons, Montbrun and Merne, and about 4000 taken
Prisoners, with all the Bagage and Ammunition, whilst on the part of the
Spaniards not above 1000 were slain, the chief being the Sieur Binecourt,
Master de Camp, and two Noblemen of Germany, Count Mansfield was wounded in the
thigh, and Count Monbrey in the knee.

After this Battle the strong Town of St. Quintines fell into the hands of the
Spaniard, as likewise did Haron and Chastellet, they ranging freely in those
parts for that Summer without any interruption.

Out of Notalis Comes, etc.

Thus Wars sad Chance we see in blood is writ
And Victory flies to whom she thinks most fit,
Whilst mighty Realms contend for Sovereignty

A Relation of the great Sea Fight, fought off the Coast of England, between
the English and Spaniards in the year 1588. vulgarly called the fight of the
Spanish Invasion.
KIng Philip of Spain fretting in his mind at the prosperous success of
Elizabeth Queen of England, both abroad and at home, and more especially
resenting her assisting the Flemings, in their Wars held against him in the
Low Countries, as also the depredations made by Sir Francis Drake, and others
in the West-Indias, he at the Instigation of Pope Sixtus V. and some English
Fugitives prepared a great Navy to Invade England, for whose vastness and
seeming strength, it was named by the Spaniards the Invincible Armado, though
in the sequel it proved otherwise. This great Fleet at its setting out
consisted of 130 Galleoons, Gallies-men of War and Tenders containing 57808
Tuns, where in were 8405 Mariners, 19295 Soldiers, or Landmen, and 2088
Gally-slaves furnished with 220000 great shot, 4200 Kinta^s of Powder, 1000
Kintals of Lead for small bullets, 1200 Kintals of Match, 7000 Muskets, and
10000 Halberts with Partisam, Fieldpieces, and other Provisions requisite for
such an undertaking, of which the Duke of Medina Sidona was Admiral, and was to
be joined by the Prince of Parma, Governor of Flanders, and to be supplied
with further necessaries, which accordingly he provided and prepared in all
parts of those Provinces, upon notice of which and the other preparations, the
Queen whom they thought by reason of the close carrying on of their design to
surprise, unprovided for so important a defense, caused her Navy Royal
immediately to be fitted out, under the command of Charles Lord Howard of
Effingham, whom she constituted Lord Admiral, and Sir Francis Drake
Vice Admiral, with a Squadron was dispatched to the West of England, there to
cruze and observe the motion of the Enemies Fleet, whilst Henry Lord Seymour
second Son to the Duke of Somerset stood with Forty Sail to the Coast of
Flanders, to prevent Parma's joining with Medina, and thereupon mustered an
Army of Landforces, consisting of 10000 Horse and 32000 Foot, with part of
which she not only Encamped at Tilbury in Essex, but with the rest secured the
Places that seemed to Render the Enemy the easiest Access of Landing, though
through many distresses and disappointments the Spaniards had met withal, it
was confidently reported and believed by some that they could not in any
convenient time make their intended attempt or enterprise, yet contrary to the
expectation of the English, they on the 11. of July cast Anchor in the Chanel,
and from thence sent a Dispatch to Parma in the King's name, to join his Forces
with them, and send such necessaries as were convenient to further the
Expedition, but on the 20th. following about noon, being discried by the
English, they hasted out of the Harbors, and on the 21. of the same instant,
viz. the Lord Admiral Howard, Drake, Hawkins and Forbisher, the most expert in
Maritime Affairs, that Europe then afforded, played furiously in the Rear of
the Enemy, who were drawn up in the form of a half Moon, and so battered
Rechalde who commanded a Gally of great force, that he (his Squadron being put
to the worst) was so disabled, that he had fell into their hands had he not
been Received shattered as he was into the middle of the Armado, as likewise
was the Catharine of Spain, a Ship of great burden, although the Spanish
Admiral declined fighting as much as was possible, bulwarking the smaller
Vessels with those of greater force, bearing from the Coast of England toward
Calais, so that a great Ship of Biscay, commanded by Don Oquendo, being fired
on the 22. of June, a great Gally commanded by Pedro Valdez fell into the hands
of Sir Francis Drake, in which beside the Commander Don Pedro de Valdez, were
Vasques de Sylvas and Alanzo de Saijs, and other Noblemen, the whole number of
Men on Board, according to their own computation being 430, which were made
Prisoners and disposed of in diverse places, till they were afterward Ransomed,
nor fared the Vice Admiral De Oquendo better, for his Ship having received
great damage by fire, she was taken with much treasure and carried into
Plymouth, and although hitherto it had been a kind of a moving Fight, the
Spaniards showing an unwillingness to Engage before they Received their
Succors and supply from the Prince of Parma, who was indeed blocked up at the
same time by the Hollanders, who stood upon their guard on the Coast, yet now
the English Admiral pressed their towering Castles with his shot so furiously,
that many of them were miserably rent and torn, with small damage to the
English, for that the Spaniards being high built could not well bear their
Canon upon the English Ships, whose hulls were much lower, and when at any time
they did, the Commanders with their nimble Ships shifted and tacked to a better
and more commodious station of anoying the Enemy, and so incessantly the
Batteries were made, that nothing was heard but the thundering of the Canons,
and the cries of Men, whilst ascending smoke made dark the Skies. But the Lord
Admiral not thinking it convenient to graple with such strength, who had a
strong Army on board. After he had taken and sunk Twelve of their Ships and
Galleys, and killed them above 5000 men whilst they lay at Anchor before
Calais, in vain expecting the Prince of Parma: A stratagem was found out to
break and disperse them, which took more effectually than what had before been
put in practice, viz. into Eight of the oldest and least serviceable English
Vessels were put Pitch, Tarr, Rosin, Hemp, Flax, and other combustible matter,
their Guns charged and rammed higher than usual with stones, crossbar-shot,
pieces of Iron, and the like, when in the Night time the wind standing fair,
they were sent amongst the thick Squadrons of the Spaniards under the Conduct
of two expert Sea-Captains, viz. Mr. Young, and Mr. Prowess, with a command to
fire them so soon as they were within Musket Shot of the Enemy, and let them
drive, which by Trains laid for that purpose, they accordingly did with such
an unexpected thunder-crack, as made the Ocean tremble, and so amazed the
Spaniards with the unexpected approach of these flaming messengers, which bore
directly upon them, that seting up a dismal cry from all parts, they cut their
Halsers and Cables, as not having time to weigh Anchor, and scattered in great
confusion to avoid being fired, and such was the consternation, that running
fowl upon each other, great damage ensued, and yet greater, for by reason of
the nearness of the shore, diverse run upon the shallows and Sands, where some
of them were taken by the French as wrecks, others by the Hollanders and
Flushingers, and some fell into the hands of the English, who still pursued
them with the perpetual thundering of their Canon, and from that time deprived
them of Calais Road, so that finding themselves in a bad case, and no hopes of
Relief from Parma, who being blocked up, could not possibly come forth, a
Council was called to determine what was further to be done, to prevent the
danger that threatened them, and after many debates, it was Resolved, that
seeing the Prince of Parma had failed them, and they not in a condition to
continue long in these Seas, without a supply of Provision, and other
necessaries, they should immediately return to Spain by the Northern Passage,
as not imagining the English would follow them that way, yet were they not a
little deceived, for the Admiral doubting they might land in Scotland, chased
them to the Coast of Norway, and there left them to more serious Councils, not
without much indamaging them with his shot, as he hung on their Rear by the way.

The Spaniards being now freed from pursuit, had time to consider their loss,
which they found to be very great, and not to be Repaired in those Parts, and
especially wanting water, they were obliged to throw most of their Mules and
Horses over Board to save that little they had, and steering toward Spain,
sailed about the Cathanes, and the Coast of Ireland even to 61 degrees North
Latitude, which extraordinary change of Air disagreeing with the constitution
of the Spanish bodies, many of them died by the way, and so passing between the
Orcades and the Islands of Fare, the Duke of Medina with the best Galleys and
Ships stood away to the Westward for Spain, leaving the rest to follow as they
were able, where at his arrival he was deposed from all his Places of Authority
and trust, forbid the Court, and commanded to Retire and live private; as for
the Ships he left to follow him, they many of them fell in with the Coast of
Ireland, and being unskilful in those Seas, were cast away upon Rocks, and
shallows, and some were by the force of the Current driven into the Channel,
and taken by the English, but miserable was their condition, who fell into the
hands of the Irish, who for the most part put them to the Sword, for the
Plunder they found about them, others were taken by the Rochelers, and some
driven into New Haven in Normandy, so that of 134 Sail that set out of the Bay
or Port of Lisbon, only 53 returned into Spain; of the four Galleasses of
Naples but one, of the four Gallioons of Portugal but one, of the 91 Gallioons
from diverse Provinces but 33, so that in this Expedition 81 of their Vessels,
together with 13500 Soldiers and Seamen perished, many of the slain being
Persons of the first Rank and of great Quality, the Prisoners of note were Don
Pedro de Valdez, Don Vasques de Sylva, Don Alanzo de Saijs, Don Alanzo de
Luzon, Roderigo de Less, and Don Diego Piementelli, nor was there a Noble
Family in Spain in this Expedition, the charge of which is almost incredible,
but lost a Son, a Brother, or Kinsman. Speed in Reg. E. R.

Thus, thus, to frustrate what proud Spain designed,
The Rocks, the Fire, the Seas, the Shores, the Wind,
With English Arms and Courage all combined,
Ambition sinks, in vain is Mortal might,
When against it an Immortal Power does fight,
To vindicate the wronged, and do 'em Right.
Nor has Spain yet Retrieved what there it lost,
But wants those Millions that Armado cost.
A Relation of the Battle of Nimbre de Dios, fought between Captain Drake and
the Spaniards in America, on the 28 of July, 1572.
SIR Francis Drake being upon the discovery in the West Indias, and
understanding from the Natives by what cruelty and oppression the Spaniards had
gathered great Treasure in those Parts, he resolved to put in with them for a
share, and thereupon sailed to Nimbre de Dios, a Seacoast Town, where a great
part of the Spanish Treasure lay, and in the Night time came on shore, seizing
upon six Pieces of Ordnance, those that guarded them being fled to Alarm the
Town, when leaving a sufficient number of men to make a safe Retreat, if
occasion required it, he with great Resolution and bravery stormed the Town on
the East Side behind the Treasure-house, notwithstanding the opposition the
Spaniards made, and with Bea^ of Drum and Sound of Trumpet forced his way to
the Market place, whilst the Soldiers that were there in guard, as likewise
the Inhabitants put themselves in Arms, making show (to terrify the English)
of a greater force, by hanging lighted Matches on Lines athwart the Streets
between the Churches and the Crosses, but that stratagem being discovered, they
fled upon the first Charge, yet the Soldiers rallying came to push of Pike,
and the But-ends of their Muskets, so that a sharp Fight on all hands ensued;
but Drake encouraging his Men, and furiously pressing on, the Spaniards at last
throwing away their Weapons, betook themselves to flight, whose scattered
Weapons in the chase wounded many of the English, which obliged them to Return
to the Marketplace with the Prisoners they had taken, and being showed by them
the King's Treasure-house, they perceived in it through the Grates or
Iron-wickets, by the help of a Torch, a Pile of Silver-bars about seventeen
foot in length, ten in breadth, and twelve in height, and were given further to
understand, that in an other Treasury near the Waterside, there was much Gold,
and very many Jewels, but Drake doubting that whilst they were busy in lading
them away, a greater number of Spaniards might set upon his Men, resolved to
keep guard till the Morning, but some of the Soldiers, by reason of the
excessive storm that then happened, murmuring at the delay, he to satisfy
them, said, though to the loss of any thing that might happen, seeing he had
brought them to the mouth of the Treasury of the World, he would be no
hindrance of their making themselves Master of it, and so when the storm was
over, unwilling to give them any longer leisure to demur, he immediately
advanced, commanding part of his men under the leading of his Brother John
Drake and John Oxnam, to break the King's Treasury, whilst the Rest with
himself in Arms supported them; and certainly they had possessed themselves of
a vast booty, had not an unhappy Accident fallen out, viz. All things being now
in a readiness for the Attack: as Renowned Drake advanced to this great
Enterprise, his Men perceived him to faint, and to their unspeakable sorrow
found the cause to proceed from the great effusion of blood that had issued
from his Leg, wounded with an Arrow, and filled the prints of his footsteps,
the which though it much pained him he concealed, till his Men discovered it,
as loath to dismay them, well knowing they would not suffer him to perish, and
if they forsook their station to carry him on board, they could not at that
time regain it, and so it happened, for although they would have hazarded much
for such a booty, yet they thought their Captain's life of greater moment that
both the Indias, so that having refreshed him a little with some Cordials, and
bound up his Leg as well as the Juncture would permit, they entreated him to go
on board, but finding him unwilling to remove, rather choosing to hazard his
life than retire from so great an advantage, they, partly by entreaties and
partly by force, constrained him to Embarque, and so for the safety of their
Captain were content to forgo a treasure of inestimable value, yet in the
Harbor they took a Ship richly laden with Wines and other Commodities; in this
undertaking of the English few were lost, but of the Spaniards near 100 killed
and wounded; and though he sped not in this place, yet sailing in those new
discovered Parts of the World, he took may. Towns and sundry Rich Prizes,
returning victorious with much Treasure and Applause.

Thus Drake Renowned, the second Neptune styled,
In their new world the insulting Spaniards foiled,
And in wide Tracts discovers unknown Stars,
Whilst England's Fame to both the Poles he bears,
Views what ever Phoebus sees in his vast round,
And Lands unnumber'd, then unknown he found
Wild Nations him Adoring as a God,
Whilst he in Triumph on the Ocean rode;
Their Crowns and Scepters yielding to his hands,
Whose Name yet fair in Fames large Record stands.
A Description of the Memorable Battle fough^ between Hasan Bassa General for
Amurath the Third of that Name, Emperor of the Turks, and the Confederate
Princes of the Empire.
A Murath, the Third of that Name Emperor of the Turks, having obtained a
small Victory over the Persian Sultan, and growing proud of his acquirement
restless and impatient of Peace, called hi^ Bassas to consult what War was most
convenient to be undertaken the succeeding Spring, amongst whom were eight
different Opinions, whereof the first was to re^ new the War against the
Persians, the second to Invade the Kingdom of Fess an^ Morocco, the third to
War upon Spain, the fourth to besiege Malta, the fifth to Wa^ upon the
Venetians, the sixth against Sigi^mund King of Poland, the seventh to Invade
the Territories of Rodolphus the German Emperor, all which, together with the
several Reasons moving thereto, being patiently heard by Amurath, the last was
approved, so that resolving to turn his Arms on Hungary, etc. he raised huge
Forces in all his Dominions, as longing for the remaining part of that Kingdom,
and the Principality of Austria, wherefore, the better to be at leisure, he
concluded a Peace with the Persian Sophy, ordering his Garrisons on the
Frontiers to prosecute thoir Advantages with Fire and Sword, which they
improving, seized upon Willitz the Metropolis of Croatia, and committed therein
many outrages, and still increasing in power, they suddenly and unexpectedly
enclosed 6000 Foot and 500 Horse of the Christian Forces that had taken the
Woods Mountains and straight Passages, and cu^ them almost all in pieces,
loading with their heads six Wagons, which sudden Eruption so Alarmed the
Christian Printes, that they incontinently raised a great Power to put a stop
to the progress of the infidels, who had by that time taken many Towns, Castles
and strong Holds; and ^est Amurath should allege that these unexpected
Hostilities were committed without his knowledge, the Emperor Rodolphus sent
an Ambassador to Constantinople to understand the reason why without any cause
he had broken the League, but not being able that way to get any satisfactory
answer, he prepared more vigorously for War, causing his Forces to join with
those already raised by the Electoral Princes, etc. under the command of
Rupertus Eggenbert his General, who upon the approach of the Enemy consulted
with his Chief Commanders what was best to be done, and they being all of
opinion that it was best speedily to give Battle, thereby to prevent their
joining such other Forces as were advancing to their Aid, it was Resolved that
the Army, consisting of 40000 horse and root, should immediately advance, which
they did with much celerity in good Array, yet not so secretly but the Turkish
Commanders had notice of it, and put themselves in order to receive them and so
confident were they of obtaining the Victory, that they dreamt of nothing but
the spoil of the Christians, whom they already concluded overthrown, by reason
of the disproportion of number, they being indeed much inferior in number
(...) the Infidels, yet had the Imperial General so ordered his Battle, that
placing the Hussars and Croats in the Vanguard those of Carolslad and the
Harquibusiers of Serina in the left Wing, in the right the Borderers of
Carrania, all Horsemen, and in the main Battle the rest of the Soldiers with
the Horsemen of Silesia, under the command of Sigismund Paradiser, the
Reerward was encompassed or guarded with three Companies of Switzers; nor were
the Turks less diligent in Marshalling their battle, placing their best Footmen
in the front, and extending their Wing of horse to great advantage.

Thus things being in a readiness on either part, the Charge was sounded,
whereupon the Croats and Hussars in the Vaunt-Guard gave the first onset with
such fury, that being seconded by the Lord Aremsberg, they after a cruel fight
broke through the Squadrons of the Turks main battle, with their huge Swords
making fearful slaugh^er and wide desolation, insomuch that the stoutest gave
way, nor could Hassan Bassa their General, with threats and promises, Restrain
it, but still shrinking together in fearful manner, and both the Wings broken
by the Imperial horse, who fell upon them with a tempest of shot, by which a
great number of them were overwhelmed: this great Army consisting of 80000
horse and foot, fell into rout and confusion in less than three hours space,
and although Hasan Bassa endeavored to make an orderly retreat, yet he could
no^ do it, for the Christians following furiously, and charging upon those that
fled raised in them such a fear to prevent the Sword that urged them behind,
that in hastily passing the River Odder, a great number of them were strangled
in the Waters, and those that stayed in a fearful manne^ on the banks to search
for the foards, were most of them miserably slain, so that those who remained
disranked and sough^ every where to save themselves, by which means the
slaughter was scattered over a^ the field, and had been very great ha^ not the
approach of Night put an end to it yet there perished by the Sword, etc. 18000
besides a great number that perished in the River, and amongst the slain Hasan
Bass^ the General, Mahomet Beg, Achmet Beg, Suffer Beg, Meni Beg, Framulan Beg,
Curlii Beg^ Operd Beg and Goschus Bassa, together with Sinan Beg, Amurath's
Nephew, the only So^ of his Sister: As for the Prisoners taken they were many,
yet few of note, though the spoil of the Camp was very great. The Battle thus
happily obtained, the Christians, as well the Commanders as the Soldiers, fell
on their knees and gave immortal thanks to the God of Battles, to whom alone
they ascribed their success.

The News of this overthrow coming to the Knowledge of Amurath, he highly
raged, and at the Instigation of his Sister, who refused to be comforted for
the loss of her Son, sent a blasphemous denuntiation of War, stiling himself
there in Monarch of the World, and a Mighty God on Earth, etc.

Thus those that sought for Blood, with Blood were paid,
And meeting Death, their cruel fury stayed,
Who had with Flame whole Realms in Ashes laid.
A Description of the famous Battle of Lutzen, fought on the sixth day of
November, Anno 1632. between Gustavus Adolphus, the Warlike King of Sweden, and
Duke Walenstine, Generalissimo of the Imperial Army.
THE King of Sweden having entered the Empire with an Army, and overthrown
Count Tilly, the Imperial General with incredible slaughter, the Terror of his
Name spread wide, which caused many Towns and strong holds to be at his
Devotion, nor was it expected but that every where being victorious, he would
in a short time make himself Master of the Empire, though to oppose him
Walenstine Duke of Frizland was made Generalissimo, and another huge Army
raised, which the King, upon notice of their being at Lutzen, resolved to
attack, and therefore in the most secret manner marching all Night, he came
within sight of them in the Morning, and drew up into battle in this manner,
viz.

He divided this Army into two fronts, and each of these into the Wings and
battle, with their Reserves, each of the Wings composed of six Regiments of
Horse, lined with five bodies of commanded Musquiteers, every one of them
advancing with two Fieldpieces in their front, which played continually on the
Imperialists. The battle in each front consisting of four Brigades of foot, a
reserve of foot being placed between the two middle Brigades of the first
front, and a reserve of Horse hindermost of all between the two middle Brigades
of the rear or second front, and before each Brigade marched six pieces of
great Ordnance, which the King himself (who would ever be in places of greatest
danger) led, committing the lest to Duke Bernard of Saxon Weymar, and the main
body to Dodo Kniphausen, Serjeant-Major, and General of the whole Army, under
whom commanded many experienced Colonels and Captains, etc. of sundry Nations.

The order of the Imperial Army was in this manner, viz. It being drawn into
one large front, was divided into three bodies, the Right Wing of Horse which
tended to the town of Lutzen, was committed to the Count Rodolpho Coloredo,
appointed for that day Serjeant-Major-General of the Army, and was lined with
commanded Musquiteers, besides supported by others that were lodged in the
Gardens, and had likewise the advantage of certain Windmils standing upon small
Hills, whereon they planted nine pieces of Ordnance, the Mills and Millers
Houses serving them for a good shelter, the main battle or middleward was
commanded by the Generalissimo's station, being in the head of the Regiment of
Piccollommine's, consisting of Horse, which was placed in the middle of the
foot Regiments, the left wing placed opposite to the right, was commanded by
Colonel Henderick Holek, lately made Lieutenant velt Marshal under velt
Marshal Lupenheirne, yet no longer than till the other who was absent should
take the field.

Both Armies being ordered in battle array, and the advantages of the Ground
which was in a manner a plain Campain, unless some few ditches that proved
troublesome, being taken by either General as well as the time and opportunity
would permit, as likewise those of the Wind and Sun, which in this case is ever
observed by great Captains to be no small advantage to those whom they favor.
The fight began with the thundering of the great Ordnance, by which many were
overthrown on either side, but the eager Soldiers desired to come to a close
fight, so that advancing hastily toward each other, after the small pieces
that were in the head of the Musquiteers on the Kings part were fired, they
gave their Salvos, upon which the Horse that supported them charged furiously
upon the German Horse, so that many were slain, and a great number beaten down,
who were most of them trodden under foot, and the King having commanded Colonel
Stolhaunsh a Fleming, to charge the Cuirassiers, who were all in black Armor,
himself advanced at the head of the right Wing, with his Pistol in one hand,
and his Sword in the other; and when he had fired his Pistols, regarded not to
recharge them, but charged upon the Enemy with his Sword so furiously, that
although they fired thick upon him, and flashes were even in his Face, he
desisted not till he had broke their Array; yet a Regiment of Croats taking the
Advantage of the Kings being hotly engaged, thrust between the Right Wing and
the main battle, in order to seize upon the Baggage, and blow up the Powder,
but Colonel Bulach making head against them, they were obliged to retire; yet
upon his wheeling about to recover his station, they fell on his Rear, and much
disordered that squadron of Swedish Horse, but a sudden Mist falling, it was
not perceived by the rest of the Imperialists. And now the fight being hot on
all parts, and the King out of the greatness of his heat and C^th^ge still
pressing on, and entering amongst the Ranks of those Iron-men (as he called the
Cuirassiers) being himself only clad in a buss Coat, and not being well
supported, he was overlayed with numbers, for his men being in danger to be
hemmed in by the Cuirassiers and the Regiment of Picolmaini, which came fresh
to charge them, were obliged to give ground and retire toward their own bodies
to prevent the danger they foresaw; so that the King being left open to the
shot of the Enemy, received a shot in his left Arm by a Musquet-bullet, which
in the heat of his Courage he at first sli^oveed, but perceiving the blood gush
out abundantly, and that the bone was splintered, he thought fit to give way to
necessity, and thereupon calling to the Duke of Saxen Luenberg who charged with
a party on his right; Cousen, says he, I am surely wounded, help me to make my
retreat, the which whilst the Duke labored to do, the Squadron at the head of
which the King charged being put to the retreat, an Officer of the Cuirasiers
knowing the King broke desperately through the Ranks that sheltered him, and
coming behind him as he was Retreating, sh^^ (...) through the Body with his
Pistol, (...) at the same time, this is the right bird, yet enjoyed it not, for
scarce had he done it before himself was shot dead on the place, by Luchan the
Master of the Dukes horse, and so lost his expected Reward, yet so hotly the
Cuirasiers charged, that the Swedes were not capable of bringing off the dying
King, but were obliged to let him fall, where he was barbarously mangled by the
Enemy, who stripped him, every one getting something that could conveniently
come at him, as a Trophy of honor, all that he was heard to say, as those
report who were about him, when th^as demanded who he was, for at first those
that stripped him did not certainly know him, was, viz. I am the King of
Sweden, who do Seal the Religion and Liberty of the German Nation with my
blood, and then after some hesitation subjoyning, Alas, my poor Queen, and so
recommending his Soul to God, gave up the Ghost, yet was his Body after ward
Rescued and honorably buried, his death being lamented even by his Enemies:
and although the King was thus slain, yet he was a Conqueror even in death,
for the Swedes, instead of being discouraged, grew more enraged, and breathing
nothing but revenge for the death of their King, charged so furiously on all
parts, that although ^resh Supplies came hourly to the assistance of the
Imperialists, yet after nine hours obstinate fight, not only their right Wing
but their main battle was broken and disordered, which obliged the
Generalissimo, under the favor of the Night to draw off, yet in such
confusion, that most part of his Soldiers, fearing the pursuit of the Swedish
horse, disranked and fled, leaving their Cannon, and a great part of their
Baggage behind them, together with their wounded men, and 6000 dead upon the
place, many of them of great Note, when on the Swedes part there died not above
2000. the chief of Note on the part of the Imperialists were the Abot of
Fulden, by his place a Prince of the Empire, the Counts Puppenheim and
Bartholdus, Walenstine's Sergeant, Major General Bruner, Lodovicus Westrum,
Lancius Comargo, Witzeb and Fines, all Colonels of the respective Regiments,
together with Borda Taxheim, Lampart and Cammarhoff, Lieutenant Colonels,
besides diverse Sergeant Majors, Captains and Lieutenants; and on the Kings
side, of Note was himself, Nicholas Count of Wesenburg, Grave Nelees, Sergeant
General Isler, and Colonel Gersdorf, with some Lieutenant Colonels, and
diverse Captains.

Thus great Gustavus fell, yet conquering died,
Fortune never gave the battle from his side,
VVhere'er he fought be was victorious still
His body only Fate had power to kill.
A Brief Description of the memorable Battles and Skirmishes, etc. that
happened during the unhappy civil Wars in England, etc. in the Reign of King
Charles the First, as they are taken and drawn from warrantable history, etc.
AFter many Indignities had been put upon King Charles the First, of blessed
Memory, by an inexorable Parliament, whom no favors nor concessions could
oblige, he thought it highly convenient to oppose their force with force, and
thereupon in August 1642. he set up his Standard at Nottingham, so that the
Hostilities being begun, after the loss of about twenty men by a Sally out of
Hull, and the routing of Colonel Fines and Sands, by Prince Rupert at
Worcester, with co^nsiderable slaughter of their men, etc. The King resolved to
march toward London, but finding the Earl of Essex, who by this time was made
General for the Parliament marched after him, and hung in a manner upon his
Rear, he faced about to give him battle, or oblige him to retire, so that the
Armies facing each other, and the King having discovered the number of the
Rebels from a convenient stand with a Prospective, and desiring God and all
good men to assist his cause, on the 13 of October 1642. he drew into a large
Field or Plain, between Edghill and Keinton, in the County of Warwick, where
Essex was putting his Army in order, so that both Armies being drawn up in
battle array, the Charge was sounded, and thereupon a dreadful fight began,
continuing bloody and doubtful, Prince Rupert, who there commanded the King's
horse, making a great slaughter, and pursuing the Enemies horse even beyond
their Baggage, so that they forsook the field, but fresh Troops coming in, the
fight-was maintained with doubtful success till Night put an end to the fury,
yet the King soon after had many Places surrendered to him, and marched
triumphantly into Oxford with 150 Colors there taken, and in this battle are
computed to be slain between 5 and 6000 men on both sides.

And now the King's Army being Recruited, and increased by the coming in of
many Troops, and the Revolt of two Regiments, and a Troop of Horse from the
Parliament, upon his taking of Banbury, he marched toward London, whither
Essex was retired, upon which Essex with an Army composed mostly of Prentices,
and the City Trained Bands, drew out to oppose his passage, which made the King
advance to gain the Bridge, to prevent his being hemmed in, by reason the
Parliaments forces possessed most of the Towns in those parts, but part of
Hollis's Regiment made head against him, and being seconded by two other
Regiments, the Passage was hotly disputed, which lasted till Night, at what
time the Parlimentarians retreated, and left the Town to the Ksng, together
with 200 of their men dead upon the place, eleven Colors and fifteen Pieces of
Ordnance, but he slighting that place, returned to Oxford with his Army: nor
was the King's success in other Parts less, for in February following, Prince
Rupert with a select Party of 4000 horse and foot, making show to Regain Hadly
Castle, a little before taken by Colonel Massey, marched immediately to
Cirencester, and charging the Guard, forced his way into the Town, with
considerable slaughter, possessing it in two hours dispute, with all the
Magazine of the County, and 2000 Arms, making at the same time 1100 persons
Prisoners, yet this Joy was somewhat lessened, by the Defeat of 1500 Welch-men,
raised by the Earl of Worcester and his Son, for the service of the King at
Hingham house, by the Forces under the command of Colonel Massey and Sir
William Waller; as for the rest of the Year 1642. it was passed over in sundry
light Skirmishes, sometimes successful to one Party, and sometimes to the
other, the most material of which was, that in Hopton-Field near Hautly in
Staffordshire, where the Earl of Northampton was slain, and that of Bramham
Moor, wherein Sir Thomas Fairfax was routed.

In April 1643, young Hautham the Son of Sir John Hautham, whose Father had
denied the King entrance into Hull, was routed by Colonel Cavendish near
Ancas^er in Lincolnshire, and most of his party slain or taken Prisoners, and a
hot skirmish happened between the Kings party and Essex's men near Causum Bridge,
wherein the former was worsted and obliged to ret^^^t with some loss; and in
May diverse s^^^mishes with various success happened in the West between Sir Ralph
Hopton, who commanded there for the King, and Sir Geo. Chudleige for the
Parliament, though the former for the most part had the advantage; nor did
Hostilities cease in other parts, for in June diverse skirmishes happened between
Prince Rupert and Essex, the most material of which was in Chalgrave-field in
Oxfordshire, where the Prince furiously charging a body of the Parliament
Horse, routed it, killing and wounding a great part of the Enemy, and amongst
the latter John Hambden, who soon after dyed of his Wound, as did some others;
and on the fifth of July Sir Ralph Hopton with a few Forces of the Kings under
his Command, engaged Sir William Waller, who had double his number, maintaining
the fight from two in the Afternoon, till about one the next Morning, whereupon
Waller perceiving him resolved to obtain the Victory or dye in the place, left
the field, yet soon after, being ashamed of the retreat. he followed Sir Ralph
to the Devises in Wilt-shire, whither he was marched with a Resolution to set
upon him, of which the King having notice, sent 1500 Horse from Oxford, (where
he lay encamped) to his assistance; but upon the Comjunction, Waller not
thinking it convenient to try the event in that place, drew off to
Roundway-down, but being hotly charged he was in a short time broken and
disordered, whereupon with his Horse he fled in great Confusion, leaving his
foot to the mercy of the Royallists, who were most of them slain in the fight,
or taken Prisoners, together with four pieces of Cannon, all the Ammunition and
Baggage, nine Cornets, and 28 foot Colors, so that by this fatal blow given on
the 13th of July, Waller having lost his Army, most of the Horse deserting him
in his flight, he hasted to London with the lamentable story of his defeat.

Essex by this time with a powerful Army having relieved Gloucester, and
surprised a Convoy of the Kings, which fell into his hands through mistake,
marched to Newberry, where the King remained as yet with his Army, and had
prepared to receive him in the best order the short time of notice would give
leave or opportunity; so that on the 20th of September 1643, both Armies
confronting each other the charge was immediately sounded, and seconded by the
thundering of the Cannon, and Vollies of small shot on either side, whilst
Prince Rupert with his Squadron forced the main battle, and put it into great
disorder, but whilst he pursued his good fortune, he found himself charged by
two squadrons of Horse that descended from the Hill, where till now they had
been posted, so that the fight was doubtful and bloody on all parts, it being
in many places brought to the Sword; so that the Lord Jermin, who commanded
there a Regiment of horse for the King, being over charged by number, was
obliged to force his way (not without great hazard) through the Battalions of
foot, yet was the fight maintained with considerable slaughter on either part,
till Night put an end to the fury, both Armies keeping the field till the next
day, and then retired from each other as by consent. The Persons of Note slain
were the Earls of Carnarvan and Sunderland, the Lord Viscount Faulkland, and in
all on both sides, near six thousand.

In March, Sir Thomas Fairfax and Mitton were set upon by Prince Rupert at
Drayton in Shropshire, and routed; as likewise was Sir John Meldrum, who had
entered England with his Scotch Forces, in favor of the Parliament, forced to
leave Newark which they had besieged, with the loss of their Canon, Ammunition,
and all their Baggage, which was Relieved by Prince Rupert, and only permitted
to depart with their Lives: But now Sir William Waller having gotten another
Army, Anno 1644, fell upon the Lord Hopton's Forces near Winchester at
unawares, and over-pow'ring him in number, cut off diverse of his men, and
obliged him to leave the field, whereupon Winchester surrendered, but Waller was
soon after overthrown by the King's forces at Crop-ready Bridge, and Essex with
the gross of the Parliament Army blocked up in Cornwall; and now the Earl of
Newcastle being besieged in York, Prince Rupert advanced with an Army of Horse
and Foot to Relieve the City, upon whose approach the Besiegers drew off, and
were upon their retreat hotly pressed and charged by a Sally from the Town,
when the Garrison, under the command of the Earl, joining with the Prince, they
with conjunct Forces followed the Parliament forces to a place called
Marston-Moor, where both Armies drew up, and with great sury joined battle,
which continuing with much effusion of blood for the space of four hours,
victory in the end declared against the Royalists, and in this fight, called by
many the bloody fight of Marston-Moor, 9000 men on both sides are computed to
be slain, after which battle York surrendered, and almost all the Towns in the
North, so that for a while, nothing but Skirmishes happened: But on the 27 of
October both Armies meeting a second time near Newbury, an obstinate fight
ensued, but the Royalists having done all that could be expected from true
valor, and still oppressed with fresh numbers of the Enemy, were forced in the
end to give way to necessity, and leave the field in some disorder; nor is it
guessed that on both sides less than 4500 were slain, after which nothing more
happened in England this year, but the skirmishing of Parties, and taking of
Towns and Castles; but in Scotland the Marquess of Montross with inconsiderable
forces, raised by virtue of a Commission from the King, routed diverse Armies of
the Covenanters, putting all Scotland in fear of being Reduced to its obedience
by his Prowess.

Anno 1645, Essex having laid down his Commission, it was taken up by Sir
Thomas Fairfax, and Cromwell was made Lieutenant General, most of the prime
Officers of the Army being changed, yet the King's party strugled strongly for
the Royal cause, though many finding things in a manner desperate, had retired
from the Army, and passed the Seas, for besides diverse skirmishes, Colonel
Massey in April, was routed by Prince Rupert at Lidbury with considerable loss:
But in June following, the King's forces were defeated at Langport, where about
200 were slain, and 1400 taken Prisoners, which occasioned soon after the
surrender of Pomfret, Scarborough, Bath and Bridgwater; yet in August the
Parliaments Quarters, with some slaughter on both parts, were beaten up about
Tame, and the Scots defeated at Kielsieth in Scotland by Montross; and in
September, Montross was defeated at Phillipphaugh in the said Kingdom, and the
King's forces in England were Routed on Routon heath near Chester: and in
October the Lord Digby was likewise defeated at Sherborn in the County of York;
and in March following, the Lord Ashley was defeated near Stow, and Dening
surrendered to the Parliament; yet the great blow that caused the Royal Cause so
much to decline, was the unfortunate battle of Naseby, fought near the Town of
that name, and so, as it was the saddest, I shall conclude, with the
description of it, this unfortunate War.

The Armies meeting near Naseby, and the King in a Council of War resolving to
give battle to Fairfax, who had for some time followed him in the Rear, he so
ordered it, that himself commanded the main Body, and Prince Rupert, assisted
by his brother Prince Maurice, the right Wing, and the Lest was committed to
Sir Marmaduke Langdale, there were likewise two Reserves, the one commanded by
the Earl of Lindsey and the Lord Ashley, and the other by the Lord Bards and
Sir George Lisle; of the Rebels Army Fairfax and Skippon commanded the main
Body, the Right Wing was committed to Cromwell and Colonel Rossiter, and the
left to Ireton, there were in the Army likewise two Reserves, under the charge
of Colonel Pride, Rainsborrough and Hammond.

The Armies being in array, the Charge was sounded, whereupon Prince Rupert
advanced with great Resolution, charging the Left Wing commanded by Ireton,
which after some Resistance was forced to give ground, in this conflict Ireton
was wounded in the face and thigh, and had his Horse shot under him, and was
taken Prisoner, so that the Prince pursuing this advantage, followed the chase
even to the Town of Naseby, and upon his return summoned the Baggage and
Artillery to surrender, but without success in the main, for by reason of the
Prince his not timely returning to the battle, Cromwell had the best opportunity
to charge the King's Left Wing, which he did with such fury, that he soon broke
and disordered it, whereupon that Wing fled, leaving the main battle (wherein
was the Person of the King) open and unguarded in either flank, so-that the
Reserves not being able to make it good, and Cromwell returning with his
victorious party before the Prince, charging in the flank, whilst the battle of
the Enemy did the like in the Front, notwithstanding the great Resistance that
was made, the King's battle of Footmen became broken and disordered; so that
although it came to handy-strokes, with much Resolution and obstinacy on either
part, yet fresh Supplies of the Parliament foot coming in, and the Royal-Army,
considering the safety of the King, who was pressed on all parts, finding it
self unable to make longer resistance, retreated out of the Field, as the
Prince was advancing, who perceiving the bad fortune of the King's Army since
his absence, and despairing to restore the battle, retired likewise; Fairfax
pursuing the King till within two miles of Leicester, though in the way a
Retreating-fight was maintained on the part of the Royalists, so that the King
not thinking himself safe in Leicester, marched without staying directly to
Litchfield.

In this Fight about twenty Colonels and Officers of lesser note, together
with 600 common Soldiers were slain of the King's Party, and many wounded,
amongst whom of note, the Earl of Lindsey, Lord Ashby, Colonel Rastol, etc.
but almost all the Foot, together with their Officers, were taken Prisoners,
and in all six Colonels, eight Lieutenant Colonels, eighteen Majors, seventy
Captains, 4500 private Soldiers, 200 Ensigns, one of the King's Coaches, with
part of his Treasure, and almost all the Wagons, Ammunition and Baggage,
together with his Letters and Furniture, with twelve Pieces of Ordnance, 8000
Arms, and the KING's Standard, which quite broke the strength o^ the Royalists,
insomuch that they could no^ bring any formidable Army into the field
afterward: nor was it long before the King^ being besieged in Oxford, made His
escap^ thence, and cast himself upon the Scotch Army, who for a Sum of Money
delivered Him up to the Parliament, whose usage toward Him was so Inhumane,
that it cannot be mentioned without a deep sense of sorrow by any good
Christian.

Wherefore in silence let us mourn His fate,
Who died a Martyr for the Church and State.
A Brief Description of the second Battle of Worcester, fought on the Fatal
Third of September, Anno 1651.
KIng Charles the Second, of blessed memory, being crowned at Scone in
Scotland, entered England with an Army, for the Recovery of his Right, in August
1651 and by easy Marches, with little difficulty, entered Worcester on the 22
of August, being Joyfully received by the Town's men, who were glad of that
opportunity to Return to their Allegiance, and there it was solemnly debated,
whether he should stay there, and expect the event, or immediately march to
London, but in the end the former was concluded, at least so long till the
Soldiers had well Refreshed themselves, which gave the Enemy advantage to
gather about that City from all parts, yet care was taken for fortifying the
place, and securing the advantageous Passages, to which purpose a Line, and
several Mounts were raised, yet Major General Lambert, who commanded for the
Parliament, sending suddenly a Party of Horse to discover the difficulty of the
passage at Vpton, where Major General Massey commanded 300 Horse and Dragoons
for the King, about fifty of them ventured over on a piece of Timber,
accidentally left cross that part of the Bridge that was broken down, and
although the Royal party immediately took the alarm, and beat them into a
Church, where they defended themselves, yet so speedy was Lambert in sending
over a greater number of men, that after a hot dispute, Massey having his Horse
killed under him, and himself shot through the Arm, was obliged to Retreat; and
now Cromwell's Army that had followed the King in the Rear out of Scotland,
began to join with those Parties that were already gathered out of diverse
Counties, making in all between, 50 and 60000 Men, when as the King's whole
Power exceeded not above 10000, so that with these numerous Forces, he was in a
manner encompassed, and there being no hopes left of marching away without
coming to a battle, after diverse Sallies with various success, the fatal day
drew nigh, for Cromwell, Fleetwood, and others, after the gaining the pass at
Vpton, endeavored to make themselves a clear passage to the City, that their
Army might join in the Leaguer, to which end two Bridges were ordered to be
made, the one over the Severn, and the other over Them, over the last of which
Fleetwood advanced, to attaque the City on the West part, which so Alarmed the
Royal Army that then lay within their Leaguer at St. Jones, that to hinder the
approach, they sallied out with the greatest part of the Horse and Foot, so
that a hot dispute ensued, till overpowred by number, more than by true valor,
they were obliged to Retire again into their Leaguer; But whilst this encounter
was on the West side, Cromwell passed his Army over Severn, and marched
directly toward the Wall, which the King perceiving, sallied at the head of
the Horse, and charged with so much courage and bravery, that Cromwell's own
Guard, and the best of his old Soldiers were forced to Retire, whilst seconded
by those numerous Supplies of fresh Soldiers, who served like the Turkish
Asapi, to blunt the Royal Swords, so that their wearied Arms, no longer able to
hold out, they were forced to Retreat, notwithstanding the Generous Example of
the King, who performed things worthy of wonder, executing at once the part of
a brave Commander, and a valiant Captain, in which he had his Horse twice shot
under him, yet could he not bring them to rally, for being pressed and
overpowred by numbers, they had not time or space to do it in; so that in the
end the retreat turned into a disorderly flight, whilst the Enemy following
close at their heels, entered Pell mel with them into the City.

And now notwithstanding the flight and confusion, the cry went through the
field to save the King, who although he was pressed by Duke Hamilton and
others, to reserve his fortune to a better day, yet scarcely could he be
induced to quit the field, nor would he till he perceived it impossible to
rally his men, and too plainly found the battle was irreparably lost, and that
Cromwell had entered and possessed himself of a part of the City, and soon after
took the Fort Royal by assault, putting all he found therein to the Sword, but
not without considerable loss, especially of the Cheshire men, 1600 of which
fell in the attempt; and now when it was almost too late, the King left the
field, and by the Aid of diverse Loyal Souls, after a considerable while
concealing himself, found means to escape beyond the Seas.

In this fatal battle, fought on the third of September, most of the Kings foot
were either killed or taken Prisoners, but of the Horse about three thousand
escaped out of the Field; those that account the least, recon 3000 that were
slain, though none of note amongst them, and the chief of the Prisoners were
the Earls of Derby, Lauderdale, Cleveland, Shrewsbury, and the Lord Wentworth;
and of the Scots the Earls of Cranworth and Kelly, and the Lord Sincler, with
diverse Knights and Gentlemen, and soon after Duke Hamilton and Major General
Massey and others were taken.

This strange and wonderful Victory, as the Juncto then sitting at Westminster,
gave it out, though they had ten to one in the field, made the Sectarian party
greatly rejoice, and to appoint public days of Thanksgiving, as if God were
the Patronizer of Villainies.

But since they missed of what was most their Aim,
We will not their further wicked Acts proclaim,
Lest by such Monsters we the Nation shame.
A Description of the Great and Memorable Battle, fought before the City of
Vienna in Austria, on the 11. of September, Anno 1683. between the King of
Poland, the Elector of Bavaria, the Duke of Lorain, etc. and the Grand Vizier
Cara Mustapha, etc.
VIENNA, being pressed by the Turkish Power, and the Garrison therein under
Ernestus Count of Staremberg, greatly weakened by sickness, and the loss
sustained in diverse Sallies; the Duke of Lorain having joined the King of
Poland, they thought not convenient any longer to hazard a place of such
Importance, but to attempt the Relieving of it, at the Price of a Battle, and
so on the 10 of September, 1683. about eight in the Evening the Armies marched,
in order to it, making together between 70 and 80000 fighting men, the King of
Poland commanding the Right Wing, the Dukes of Lorain and Bavaria the Left, and
the Elector of Saxony and Prince Waldeck the main Body; and in this order, with
what speed and silence they could, they marched through a great Forest, the
which had the Enemy taken care to have fortified, would have proved a work of
much difficulty; Cara Mustapha, the Grand Vizier, trusting to his number of
men, expected not to be attaqued in his Camp, he being at his sitting down
before the place 120000 strong, but finding himself mistaken, he thought it
best to Rouse out of that Security, and upon the Approach of the Christian Army
detached 10000 Horse, with an express command to possess themselves of the
Passes, etc. but the Christians before that had passed them, yet they advanced
to Charge the Front of the Army, but being gauled by a Regiment of Foot lodged
in a Vineyard for that purpose, which was supported by three other Battalions,
they only fired and wheeled off with great Cries, whereupon the King of Poland,
and the other Commanders drew the Army up in three Lines, all closed without
any Interval, and in that firmness they encroached upon the Enemy, at what time
the Turkish Horse advanced with great shouts, hoping to break the Array of the
Battle, but perceiving the Christians stood firm to expect them, they made a
halt, and discharging their Harquibusses at a distance wheeled off, whereupon
the first Line fired upon them, and the whole Army advanced by a slow March,
still gaining upon the Infidels, and making of them a considerable slaughter,
who Returning charged as before at a convenient distance, and so wheeled off,
continuing often to do the like, and as often the Christians fired upon them,
and so proceeded till within two Furlongs of their Camp, at what time a Body of
Foot and Dragoons were detached to Attaque their Canon, of which they soon
became Masters, without any considerable loss, the Enemy wanting Foot in a
readiness to defend them; nor did their Horse make any great resistance, yet
they made a show to charge the Right wing in the Flank, to prevent which, the
King of Poland commanded the second Line, to advance and make a Front on that
side, whilst in Person he charged their Front with the first Line, making them
continually to give ground, and whilst the Fight was hot on both sides, the
Turks in the Trenches made a furious Assault upon the City, struggling even at
the utmost hazard to carry it; and so resolute they were in throwing themselves
into the Ditches and Breach, that great slaughter ensued, which obliged Count
Steremberg, the Governor, to send with all speed to the Duke of Lorain for
assistance, least the Turks at that juncture should enter, and mix the ruin of
the Citizens and Garrison-Soldiers with their own, when immediately the
Margrave of Baden was detached with 5000 Horse and 3000 Dragoons, who entering
the Trenches at the time the Garrison sallied, the Turks that were in them were
cut in pieces, and trodden down on all hands to the number of 6000, which
unexpected bad success made known to the Vizier, and finding that now his hopes
were altogether frustrated of entering the City; in the time of the confusion,
he gave ground toward the Evening with the Gross of his Army, in hopes to make
an orderly retreat to the Camp, but being furiously charged by the Christians,
he fled beyond it, yet the Generals suspecting they might Rally and fall upon
them under the favor of the Night, would not enter the Camp by reason it might
be a means to separate and scatter the Army, but stood in Battalia till the
next Morning, at what time they perceived the Vizier was retired in great
confusion with all the Horse, leaving the Foot behind him, to the number of
25000, who defended themselves in the Camp for a time, but the King of Poland
entering furiously on the one side, and the Duke of Lorain and Elector of
Bavaria breaking in on the other, for want of their Horse they could make but
small Resistance, for their Array being soon broken by the violent Charge of
the Polish Horse, and overwhelmed with a Tempest of shot; they were almost all
of them killed or taken Prisoners, which gave the Polish Horse an unexpected
opportunity to pursue the Vizier, which they did with such success, that they
cut off a great part of his Rear, and took very much of his Baggage, but
fearing to separate themselves far from the Gross of the Army, least falling
into an Ambush, the Turks might Rally and charge them, they were content to
Return with what Booty they had gotten.

In the Camp were found fifty Pieces of Canon, two Horses Tails, the Grand
Visier's Standard, a great Sum of Money, a little before sent thither to pay
the Army, together with many Rich Jewels, and the Letters of diverse of the
discontented Hungarian Nobility, wherein they pressed the Vizier to besiege the
City, promising him all the Assistance they were capable of contributing
toward his taking of it by storm or capitulation: The Visier's Horse was
likewise taken, with his Pavilion, and all the Tents, Baggage, and most of the
Provision and Forage.

In this battle, fought on the 11. of September, the Turks lost between 20 and
^0000 men, and their loss in the Siege before this time, not being computed
less than 20000, besides such as dyed of the bloody Flux, and other diseases,
and amongst the slain were diverse Bassa's and Zanzacks of Provinces, and some
of note taken Prisoners, though the loss of the Christians, in consideration of
so signal a Victory obtained over the Infidels was but little, viz. about 1000
slain, and as many wounded in the Action, the Chief of the former being the
Count Trotmandorfe, and a Brother of the Duke of Croy, who advancing too far
upon the Quarters of the Janissaries, were killed with Harquibus shot, but the
loss of the Besieged was very considerable, for of 15000 fighting men which
were in the City at the beginning, not above 5000 Remained, and those so weak
by sickness and wounds, that they began to despair of holding out against
another vigorous Attaque. And thus was this great City Relieved and Rescued (in
a manner) out of the hands of the Infidels, who received such a blow in this De
feat, as has ever since curbed their Towering Ambition, and for which
miscarriage, as it was imputed to the Grand Vizier, he lost his Head, being
first strangled with a Bowstring, by the Order of the Grand Seignior, and soon
after followed another overthrow, which was given the Turks near Barkan, viz.
on the ninth of October, wherein 9000 were computed to be slain and taken
Prisoners; and of the Poles and Germans not above 600, whereupon the Fortress
of Barkan capitulated, and was put into the hands of the Duke of Lorrain for
the use of the Emperor Leopold the First, etc. And soon after that, upon the
retreat of the Vizier to Belgrade, sitting down with a part of the Army before
Gran, anciently called Strigonium, and having beaten the Turks from an Eminence
upon the River where they had fortified themselves, he had the place surrendered
after a furious Battery and many Assaults, the Garrison capitulating to march
out with as much baggage as they could carry to Buda or Newheusel, and since
that both Newheusel and Buda are reduced to their Obedience, etc. both taken by
storm, the former on the nineteenth of August, Anno 1685, and the latter on the
second of September, Anno 1686.

And thus the tot'ring Ott'man state smks low,
That late to all the World did dreadful show;
Thus God, in whose Eternal Thoughts are shut
The Fate of Empires, when he will please to do it,
Can humble haughty man, and make him know
That on him does depend all things below.
The Great and Memorable Battle of Alcazar, fought in Africa on the Plains of
Temista, between Don Sebastian, King of Portugal, and Mulei Moluc King of
Morocco; in which perished three Kings, with all the Flower of Portugal.
DON Sabastian King of Portugal, being young, and of an Heroic Spirit,
desirous to win Fame, cast in his Mind many things how and by what means he
might accomplish some enterprise that might eclips the Glory of his Ancestors;
and first he proposed to widen by a new Conquest his Territories in the
East-Indias, where the Portugals had many strong holds, but considering the way
too long for the subsistence of so great a Fleet as he must carry with him, he
in the end concluded to invade Africa, where he held several Frontire Towns,
under pretext of re-establishing Mulei Mahomet, who had fled to him for
succor, as having been a little before expulsed his Kingdom by Mulei Moluc,
his Kinsman, and so with a gallant Fleet, and an Army of between 18 and 20000
men, Portugals and Strangers, he set out of the Bay of Lisbone on the 25th of
June, 1578, and coasting along the shore, obtained a fair Wind, by the favor
of which in a few days he arrived at Almadraves, a Town between Tangier and
Arzil, and having visited his Garrison, and furnished it with all things
necessary, he landed his Forces somewhat nearer to Alarach, to furnish them
with Water, of which they were in great distress; and after diverse Councils
resolved to march into the firm Land of Africa, whilst Mulei Moluc was making
great Preparations to oppose him, and withal sent to offer the King of Portugal
ten Miles of Country lying round his Fortress of Tangier, if he would withdraw
his Army; but the King returned answer that he would not quit the Enterprise,
unless he would put Tituan Alarache and Cape D' Aghero into his Possession; but
this seeming to the Moor too excessive a demand, he sent back word that he must
consider of it although the siege was before Morocco, and so drawing forth his
Army, consisting of about 60000 men, most Horse, he advanced toward the
Portugals, who had entered by easy Marches the main Land as far as the River
Mucazan without any other Interruption than a light skirmish, and were by this
time increased by some Troops of Moors that came and submitted to Mulei
Mahomet, besides a small number of Andeluzians that guard the frontiers, so
that the Army consisted (beside those that were left to guard the Fleet) of
13000 foot, and 1600 Horse, not reckoning the Moors, who made not above six or
seven hundred, viz. Ten thousand Portugals, three thousand Germans, a thousand
Spaniards, and six hundred Italians.

The Army of Moluc consisted of 3000 Moors of Andalouzia, as well Horse as
Foot, under the conduct of Doali Algori and Osain, who had passed into Africa
from the Wars of Alpussares, he had also 3000 foot, and 25000 Horse, with 1000
Harquibusiers on Horseback, the most part of them Rhenegados and Turks; and
although these were the chief strength on which he relied, yet over and above
he had about 10000 Horse, and 5000 foot raised in haste, besides a great number
of Arabians. And in this case Moluc kept to himself the Title of Generalissimo,
and gave the Title of General of the Horse to his Brother Hamet, protesting to
strangle him with his own hands if he was found guilty of Cowardice, he made
likewise Osain Colonel of the Harquibusiers on Horseback, Mahomet Faba of the
Rhenegados, and Musa Captain of his Guard.

During the approach of the Moors, in this manner the King of Portugal divided
his Army in three squadrons, almost united together, that the one might the
better succor the other; that in the front being divided in a manner into
three divisions, for in the midst the Adventurers were commanded by Alvaro
Pirez, Brother and Lieutenant to Christopher D' Tavora; on the left hand were
the Castilians led by Alphonso D' Aguilar, lined with Harquibusiers of the same
Nation, commanded by Lewis d' Godoji, and the Germans on the left hand under
the command of the Lord Tamberg, mingled with Italian Harquibusiers, and the
Portugals of Tangier under the command of Captain Hercules Pisa, every Nation
being put in ranks with their Commanders in the front. In the squadron that
seconded this were the Portugals, under the command of Michael d' Norogna and
Vasco d' Sylveria flanked with Harquibusiers, and in the other which served for
the Rearward, were the Portugals under the command of Diego Lopez de Sequeira,
and Francis de Tavora. For the Guard, of whom two wings of shot were formed, in
the Rearward were likewise 300 Harquibusiers, and on both sides of the Army the
Horse was placed in the form of Triangles. The Right Wing commanded by George
d' Alancastro Duke of Avero; on the left was the Standard Royal Jean de Sylva
the Spanish Kings Ambassador, and Theodose Duke of Barcaellos, eldest Son to
the Duke of Bragance, on the Right hand, a little separated from these were
about 200 called Africans, which live on the Frontiers, and near them the Moors
of Mahomet, and in this order they marched with their Baggage in the midst
between their Horse and Foot on the Right Wing, on both sides leaving a space
between their Squadrons, to Retire, if need required it.

The Disposition of the Moorish Army further than what has been mentioned, was
as follows, viz. The Footmen who were all Harquibusiers, were placed in the
form of a Crescent or half Moon, the first Rank being Andalusians, the second
Rhenegadoes, and the third Africans, so distinguished from others, for their
living on the Borders upon the two Horns of the Crescent, he placed two
Squadrons, in each 10000 horse, and behind toward the Rearward, at equal
distance, followed the rest of the horse, in small Troops, with a design to
extend and encompass the Portugal Army; but whilst this was doing, Moluc the
Moorish King fell exceeding sick of a disease that had long affl^cted him, yet
put forth his strength to the utmost, to give necessary orders in all places,
and having encouraged his Soldiers with a moving Oration to do their utmost
for the preservation of themselves, and the safety of their Country, he retired
into the main Body where his Litter stood, as likewise his Guard and his
Standard.

Whilst these things passed, the Christians approached, and in the Plains of
Tamista both Armies confronted each other, when by the command of Moluc, whose
sickness extremely increased, the Moorish Horsemen extending the horns of their
Crescent, joined them at the back of the Christian Army invironing the whole
Camp in the form of an Oval circle, and then began to straiten it, by drawing
in their Ranks closer and firmer, whilst their Footmen stood in the Front to
oppose any further passage that way, when as the Canon from the Moorish Army
began to play, but without any great Damage; nor had the Christians upon the
discharge of their Canon much better success, but the Portugals being somewhat
dismayed upon the second fire, the King to prevent their further consternation
of that kind, gave the signal of Battle, whereat the Squadrons of the
Advantguard, and of the Horse moved with wonderful force and valor, the
Footmen encountering the Moors with great fury, so that a bloody and doubtful
Fight began, yet coming to hand^ strokes, the Moors were thrice broken and put
to flight with the loss of their Colors, but fresh Troops being frequently
sent to fill up the Gaps their Sword had made, they wearied the Christians with
slaughter. In the Rearward Francis de Tavora with the Regiment of Sequiera was
hotly charged, where he made a stout Resistance, killing many with his own
hand, those in the middle were the last that engaged, but Moluc gave them no
long time to consider e're he sent a Squadron of Horse to engage Vasco de
Sylveire and Michale de Norogna on either side, so that now the Fight grew hot
on all parts, but these latter made weaker resistance than the rest, many of
them throwing away their Arms, and falling on their knees yielded at
discretion, most of whose Heads the Moors cleft in sunder with their Scymiters,
they not being as yet at leisure to take Prisoners: And now the Circles of the
Moorish Horse and the Squadrons that were behind move furiously, and charged
the Avantguard, where the Italians and Castilians had cut in pieces a great
number of their best men, so that the Christian Army being closely begirt and
presled on all sides, the Soldiers grew fearful, especially the Portugals, who
began to loose their order, by shrinking together, whilst on the other hand the
Enemies orders were open, insomuch that they could approach without any
disorder of their own, nor could the King with all his Labor and Diligence
prevent it, though no Expression nor Action of Bravery was wanting in him to
set them an Example of true Valor; and much worse had been their Estate, had
not the Portugal Horse (accustomed to live on the Frontiers with the Moors) of
King Mahomet, and the Duke of Avero with his Triangle timely charged those
Troops that were hasting to break in upon, and disorder the foot, and put them
to the rout; but this happy success lasted not long, for whilst the Duke, who
commanded the greatest number, fought hand to hand, he discovered a squadron of
Horse approaching to charge him, who being far superior to him in number, he
durst not abide it, but followed the chase of those that fled, designing to
return to the fight with greater advantage, as indeed he did, for turning his
Horse he charged those that came to encounter him, but being overpowred by ods
of number, and pressing violently by the Enemy, he could find no place of
retreat amongst the squadrons, but rushing through the Ranks of the Germans,
some part of the Horse entering amongst the foot, created no small confusion on
the other side of the Army, where yet the Standard Royal remained; the Troops
of Horse there placed made great slaughter of the Moors, pursuing them even to
their Artillery; but being succored by the squadrons that were sent to support
them, they returned afresh to the fight, so that in a short time it fell out
worse with these Horse than those commanded by the Duke, the King not being
there, but gone to the Vaunt-guard, for being home charged by the Moors, they
sell in amongst and greatly disordered their own foot, so that both Horse and
Foot being in disorder, and no place of retreat left, flight and Confusion
ensued, for although this part of the Horse consisted most of Nobility and
Gentry, yet many of them being young men sent by their Friends to wait upon the
King, and little expecting to come to so sharp a Conflict, were raw and
unexperienced in the Trains of War, so that whilst some were fighting
valiantly, others even in the same Troop were flying, unpursued of the Enemy;
yet where the Italians and Spaniards fought, the King being then in the
Vaunt-guard a looker on, great resistance was made, insomuch that above 2000
Moors were killed in the place; but not being succored, they were in the end
overcome, rather weary with killing hand to hand, than by the force or Valor
of the Enemy who pressed them with their Multitude; yet the first charge of the
African Horse of the Portugal Army, commanded by Edward de Menesses, struck no
small terror to Moluc, for seeing his men fly, (sick as he was) he left his
Litter, and mounting on Hors^back (notwithstanding the Christians shot
approached) he in a great Choler advanced to restrain their flight or dye in
the place; but being seized with a fit of his Disease, in the midst of his fury
he sunk from his Horse into the Arms of his Favorites, who came about him to
persuade him to return; and being carried to his Litter, he there instantly
dyed; yet was his Death kept secret by the Rhenegados that attended him, lest
upon the bruit thereof the Moors should leave the Field, and consequently the
Victory to the Portugals, which no doubt they would have done, had they at that
time known it; and although the Portugals had notice of it some hours
afterward by several Rhenegados that deserted the Moorish Camp, and it was
published to encourage them to maintain the fight; yet it proved too late. for
by this time the greatest part of the Army was in Confusion, losing continually
ground, and shrinking together, notwithstanding the squadrons of the main
battle did not move, but unfurnished of shot, stood lookers on, urging it was
the Kings command, till charged by the Moors on Horseback, they most of them
miserably perished, their Commanders in that Consternation not being able to
draw them into any proper Posture of resistance or defense: and now Francis de
Tavora having long by his Valor withstood the Moorish charge of Horse and
Foot, was slain by a Harquibus shot, whereupon his men were so discouraged,
that many of them threw down their Arms and fled; and soon after the Duke D'
Avero having rallyed some Troops of Horse, and charged desperately upon the
Moorish squadron that attempted to force the Ranks of the Germans, had his
battle overborn, and was himself unhorsed and slain; and on the other side were
Christopher de Tavora and Alphonso de Norogna, with diverse others of account
slain. And the Arabian Adventurers (who came rather to spoil the conquered than
to fight, having a little before fallen upon the Moors Baggage when they
supposed they were in the rout) with a full carreer charging the foot that
stood firm brake their Ranks, and put them into great Confusion, so that
Victory now declaring against the Christians in favor of the Moors, and the
chief Commanders being unhorsed, and their Magazin blown up by an accidental
fire, nothing but flight and slaughter ensued, though the King, with some of
his trusty Friends about him, endeavored by Words and Example of true Valor
to restrain them, and restore the Battle, though in vain; for after he had
acted the part of a valiant Soldier, killing many of the Enemies with his own
hand, and having three Horses slain under him, in vain being required to yield,
he expired, fighting courageously on the heaps of the slain, after which every
one shifted for himself. King Mulei Mahomet escaped out of the battle, but
hastily attempting to pass the River Mucazan, now swelled by the Moons
increase, he was there drowned, as were many hundreds who were deceived in the
Foards, the River being swelled to a greater height than when they passed it;
so that as the Plain^ were covered with the slain, the River was no less
pregnant with the floting Carcasses of those that were drowned therein.

The battle thus entirely won by the Moors, Hamet hasted to his Brother Moluc^
Tent to rejoice with him for the succes^ of his Arms, but finding him dead, and
it being further made known, himself by the general consent of the Captains and
Souldery, was in the Field saluted King, and many Presents made him of the rich
Plunder found in the Christian Camp, as also of sundry noble Prisoners, amongst
whom of chiefest Note were, Anthony Prior of Crato, and the young Duke of
Barsellos: nor was the day less famous for the Death of three Kings, viz. Don
Sebastian King of Portugal, Mulei Moluc King of Morocco, and Mulei Mahomet the
cherif or expulsed King, and by the imprisonment of the greatest part of the
vanquished Nobility of a Realm, and so many Soldiers, the Prisoners being more
than the slain; for of all that landed, not above one hundred returned to the
Fleet to tell the News; and though the number of the slain on either side is
uncertain, yet next to the Kings mentioned, there fell of the Christian
Nobility, the Duke of Avero, Alphons Earl of Vimiosa, Lewis Contingo Earl of
Rodondo, Vasco d' Gama Earl of Vidignera, Alphons de Norogna Earl of Mira, John
Lobo Barron of Alvito, Alvara de Mello Son to the Marquess of Ferrara,
Rhocterick de Mello Son to the Earl Tentugvel, Jamie Brother to the Duke of
Bragance, John de Sylveria Son to the Earl of Sorteglia, Christopher de Tavora,
the Lord Tomberg, Arias de Sylva Bishop of Conionbra, with many others of
account; so that some Noble Families by this means were quite extinct, and sew
in the Kingdom of Portugal but had a Son, Brother, Nephew, or some other
Relation that fell in this unfortunate battle, sought the fourth of August,
Anno 1578.

Portugal Hist. Lib. 2. The Christian Arms thus Fate in Asrick crushed.
In Royal Deaths her killing fury blushed,
Whilst Crimson Strea^ns from mixtures of the slain.
Manured with Blood Tamista's thi^sty Plain,
A Relation of the last glorious Victory of the Christians over the Turks, near
the River Drove.
THE Hardships suffered by the Imperialists, as well in going to the Enemies,
when they were encamped under Esseck, as in returning thence, having as it were
spent all their Forces, the Duke of Lorrain had no sooner passed the Drove
again, but that he prevailed with the Duke of Bavaria to draw near the Danube,
where Provisions could not be so scarce as in the Parts whence they came. This
was a Course so necessary for the Army, that there was no other way to rescue
it from absolute Ruin; the Cavalry, more especially, had been in want of
Forage for above a Month, for having been almost continually in the Morasses,
it had had no other subsistence than what they afforded.

The Turks knowing its distress, and being also encouraged by what had befallen
them near Esseck, they marched after it. In the mean while the Imperialists got
to Mohatz', where they stayed eight whole days to recover themselves of their.
Fatigues. There the Danube furnished them with abundance of Provisions, and
their Army being in some wise recover^d, a Council of War was held to consult
on what undertaking it should be employed. Herein it was resolved that
Alba-Regalis should be besieged, and that they should immediately begin their
march to execute this design. During these Transactions, some Parties of
Tartars advanced under favor of the Woods, and snapt up our Forragers. The
next day they did the same again, and our Spies brought back word that the
whole Turkish Army was at hand, and was moving onward with Intention of
beleaguering Ziolos. A deserter and a Prisoner, taken by a Party, confirmed
this Report; whereupon a new Council of War was held, the Result of which was
to demolish Ziolos and Five-Churches, take the Garrisons thence, and all that
was within them, and then to march on to Alba-Regalis, where we were in hopes
of making good Lines before the Turks could come up to us. On the 8th of August
we left Mohatz to put this design in Execution, but we had no sooner begun our
march, but that there appeared a body of 3000 horse, that advanced very near
us, which compell^d us to halt. It skirmish'd in good order, insomuch as to
hinder the Army from getting that day to the place where the Duke of Lorrain
had designed to encamp. Thus it stopped within half a league above Mohatz, where
the Spies not only confirm^d the News they had brought the day before, but
further, that the Grand Vizier had so efficaciously represented to the Grand
Seignior, that he was in a Condition to fight the Christians, that he had
received Orders to give battle. The Duke of Lorrain imparted these News to the
Elector of Bavaria and the General Officers, who did not question the Truth of
the Information, seeing with what boldness the 3000 Horse had stopp^d them the
day before. Nevertheless they persisted in the design they had projected, and
orders were given for the continuing the march on the morrow. In the mean
while, part of the Night was spent in sending out parties, and in clearing our
Arms. The Parties gave not any Account on which any Reliance could be had, but
a Spy that had been in the Turks Camp brought back word, that the Grand Vizier
had caused the Orders he had received from Constantinople to be proclaimed
throughout the Camp, with a promise of rewarding all those that should behave
themselves as became them in the battle. The Imperial Army having renewed its
march at break of day, it was again disturbed by a body of Horse, that did not
discontinue skirting it, and ever and anon coming up to try its temper; the
Duke of Lorrain drew up Forces to receive it, but they made such an orderly
retreat, that there was no way to get them to an Engagement. This pass^d on the
9th of the Month, and the Enemies Conduct was still the same on the 10th and
11th still following the Army that was marching toward Ziolos; at last the
Imperialists being come that day near the Hill of Hersan, at the foot of which
was formerly a fine Village bearing the same Name, but which War has totally
ruined, the Duke of Lorrain had notice that the Grand Vizier, after having
marched day and night, had made such expedition that he was but a league
distant from him, nay that he had possessed himself of a Wood that was on his
way, and wherein he had put some Troops, hoping to fall upon his in the flank;
as nothing was to be neglected with such an Enemy, that since the beginning of
the Campaign had exerted such great skill and experience as was not to have
been expected in the Turks, it was thought expedient to call a Council of War
anew; it was the Elector of Bavaria^s turn to command the Vanguard the next
day; but as it was dangerous to make such a movement, it was resolved, contrary
to what is commonly practiced in a march, that every one should remain at the
Post where he was the day before. We again sent out several Parties, but of few
men only, to know exactly whether what was said of the Enemy was true; but the
Enemy on his side being not willing to lie still, sent 2 or 3000 Horse that
very Evening, which gave an Allarum to the Camp. As the whole Army stood at
their Arms, it was impossible for them to do any thing, on the contrary they
were driven back to the very thickets, and we durst not push them further, as
fearing there might be some considerable Succors behind the Bushes. The Duke
of Lorrain, to be ascertained of this, caused men to climb up to the Hill of
Hersan, and they bringing him word that there appeared a great body beyond the
thickets, some Volunteers advanced to fire their Pistols at them; but not being
so advantageously mounted as many of the Turks they went to attack, they were
immediately surrounded, and their Heads hewn off in the Presence of the whole
Army. This was done with such fearful howlings, that it daunted all those that
had not yet been engaged with those Barbarians. In the mean while, each man
withdrow into the Camp, and as it was not question^d but that there would be a
considerable brush the next day, the greater part of the Generals spent the
Night on Horseback, and toward break of day the Enemies came to surprise and
take away the main Guard. Some blows were given in this occasion, but the
Imperialists being in a due Posture, they killed five or six Turks for as many
of theirs which fell upon the Place. One of those Barbarians who was not yet
dead, having been question^d, said that the Grand Vizier was hard by with his
Army, consisting of 70000 men, that he had been retrenching himself all the
Night, that he had also lined the Wood above mentioned with more men, that he
pretended he was so advantageously encamp^d, that he bragg^d he should defeat
the Christian Army, without being compelled to give Battle. Hereupon a Council
of War was held anew, and as the falling back would have been the abandoning
of Zyclos, and the other Places on the Drove, they agreed to pursue their march
toward the former of those Places. The Orders having accordingly been given,
the Duke of Lorrain put himself at the head of the Vanguard, which was composed
of the right Wing, and that he might be under Covert from the Enemies that were
in the Wood, he left some Dragoons and Battalions to cover the flank of the
Horse. The Enemies lying at watch to take their Advantages, made then a
Movement which perplexed the Duke of Lorrain; He perceived that they were going
to fall upon the Duke of Bavaria; wherefore he Detached Picolomini with his
Brigade to go and give him Succors. And indeed they began to Skirmish with
that Duke, who advancing to encourage his Men by his presence, a Turk slipped
along under favor of the Bushes, and seeing the Elector have a Red-Embroidered
Coat on, with a white feather in his Hat, and thence presuming him to be a
Person of Quality, he fancied it would be a brave Exploit in him to kill him.
Whereupon he fired his Fusil at him, but instead of hitting him in the Body, he
hit him in the left hand, and this made so much noise that all those that were
not far from his Person believed him to be dangerously wounded. Without farther
Enquiry this same rumor was immediately spread about his Troops, and this
might have been of ill Consequence, had he not shown himself immediately to
them all.

In the mean while, the Army being on its march, and the Vanguard having passed
a Bottom, it moved up along a furrow, at the upper End of which there was a
Hedge that covered a Plain; beyond this Hedge were some Turkish Horse, which
were to amuse the Duke of Lorrain, while the main Body fell upon the Duke of
Bavaria, making a show as if they meant to come to Blows with him; but having
avoided the Battle at the same time they seemed to offer it, the whole stress
fell upon the Duke of Bavaria, who having orders not to Engage, contented
himself with standing upon the Defensive part. This did still the more Embolden
the Infidels, and coming up very close, and every other moment to try his
Temper, he sent to acquaint the Duke of Lorrain with the posture of his
Affairs, and to ask his leave to fight. The Duke of Lorrdin sent him back word
to follow the Orders they had agreed on in the Morning, but his Electoral
Highness seeing himself still more and more press^d, sent back to tell the Duke
of Lorrain, that when they were in a Council of War, they might argue as they
pleased, but that when the Enemies were pouring upon them the case was very
Different; that every other minute there fell upon him new Batallions and new
Squadrons, which it was impossible for him to stand the Brunt of, by merely
keeping upon the Defensive part, that his Men being thereby Exposed, began to
murmur at so much prudence; that it was to be feared that after their having
suffered much, they might take the Course of avoiding the Danger by flight,
since possibly they would imagine they might honorably do so, since we led 'em
not to fight.

During these Occurrences the Number of the Infidels did visibly multiply, and
having flipt along a Wood, they wholly faced it, insomuch that when the
Imperialists came to pass, they made a Discharge upon them, which laid some of
them upon the spot, and compelled the Rest to halt. To perplex them the more,
they appeared at the same time at the Vauntguard, but then Design being to make
their utmost Onsets on the side of the Elector of Bavaria; they proceeded no
further than to Skirmish which hindered the Duke of Lorain from being able to
send other Succors than that beforementioned to the Rear. In the mean while,
as every thing till then had promised them the Victory, a Body that had not as
yet fallen on, advanced upon the Duke of Bavaria, with dismal screams and
howlings, insomuch that he saw himself thereby forc^d, without staying for
permission to fight, to use his utmost Endeavors to free himself from so great
a danger. He made head against them with such Troops in whom he most Confided,
and having caused small Fieldpieces to be placed at the head of the
Batallions, they were put to so good a use that they kept the Enemies in great
Respect. In the mean while, Picolomini; who, as has been said, was sent to the
Duke of Bavaria's Succors, thinking him in great Danger, ran to him with his
Men, and the Duke seeing him come, Commanded him to drive the Turks from a
Bottom, which he had newly passed himself. Picolomini executed this Order with
great Courage, and being seconded by good fortune, he not only remained Master
of the Bottom, but also pursued the Enemies to the very Wood, which they still
possessed, and which was the place of their Retreat. There they perceived that
they had unaccountably given way, since he had none to back him; Insomuch that
being ashamed of what they had done, they returned to the Charge, and made such
havoc of the Regiment of Commerci, which was of that Brigade, that in a trice
they killed 200 of its men. The rest seeing this, betook themselves to flight,
and the sooner, for that they were all terrified to see these Barbarians, who
had cut off the heads of the greater part, which they carried before them,
howling at such a rate, as was capable of daunting the most Resolute. In this
Occasion was it that the Prince of Commerci was wounded with a Lance, and that
the Count de Ligneville, the Major of his Regiment was killed, whose Head they
cut off as well as the rest. The rest of the Turkish Cavalry, having this
advantage on its side, fell anew with extraordinary fury upon the Duke of
Bavaria, who was not a little put to it to stand the first Onset; Nevertheless
having with his own Person performed Wonders, and thereby given an Example to
others, they all stood firm; Insomuch that after a long and obstinate fight the
Turks begat to Buckle; but in such good order, that in turning their backs they
seemed less to Fly then make a Retreat. This induced the Elector to consider
whether he ought to pursue them or not; but that held him not long in suspense,
they of themselves returned to the Charge, and that with so much Resolution and
Fury, that had not the Elector commanded Cannon to be brought, they had been
Capable of routing him. but having caus^d it to be charged with Cartridges, he
dispersed the most daring. An infinite number of Volleys were fired in a trice,
and this with so much success, that we heard the Cries of those that were
wounded by them, which did so very much intimidate the rest, that they betook
themselves to flight. They retired aside the Wood, which made us halt for some
time, apprehending it might be lined, and that inste^ of prosecuting a Victory,
we might ^zard the receiving an Affront. In the mean while, the Duke of Bavaria
having caused it to be viewed, and none of them being there found, we pursued
them, but the Pursuit was not long. After we had marched a very little time we
perceived they had entered into Retrenchments, which we could scarce believe
though we saw it with our Eyes. These Retrenchments had indeed been made in
haste, and we saw they had not had time to complete them; but as their
situation was advantageous (for they were between a Morass and a Wood) it was
not judged convenient to advance further without first using mature
consideration. We perceived it to be the Grand Visiers Camp, which was
confirmed to us by some Prisoners, who informed us that there were still
several fresh forces that had not as yet stirred out of it. This occasioned new
thoughts, as also for that the head of this Camp was defended by a battery of
twelve Pieces ^f Ordnance, which began to speak to us in Thunder. It was still
further augmented in a moment, and the Turks fearing that the Imperialists
would undertake to force them, notwithstanding so many difficulties fell to
work in our very fight to stop up ^^me Passages that were as yet quite open.
^^y, and we perceived a Man with a Turba^t all beset with Jewels, and a stately
Vestment give his Orders without seeming to be under the least Concern. We
judged as well by his Character as from the richness of the things mentioned,
that if it was not the Grand Vizier, it was at least a Person of very great
Eminency among them. This whetted the Greediness of the Soldiery, who being
vexed that they had fought so long without having got any thing, asked why they
stopped at such small Impediments. The Elector was altogether of the same
Opinion, but the General Officers about him having given him to understand that
the undertaking to force those R^orenchments without Cannon, would be too great
a venture, several Pieces were brought up, which were placed battery-wise with
wonderful Expedition. The greater part of the Retrenchment being only of Dirt
and Mud, having been hereby levelled in a trice, all of a sudden we saw the
Cavalry march, without staying for Orders, telling each other that if they
could but pass, they were enriched for ever. That of the Turks seeing it coming
with so much resolution grew daunted, and without staying for its coming up,
fled cowardly away, abandoning the Infantry to the Discretion of the
Conquerors. The Janissaries were startled at the Desertion of their Horse,
nevertheless they marched up to the breach, which they defended with such
Courage as was near akin to despair. But the Cavalry having opened it self a
passage through other Places, they were quickly surrounded and put to the Sword.
The rest of the Infantry suffered very much, and none escaped but the most
ready at their heels. All the Tents were found in the Camp, which the Elector
having entered made directly up to that of the Grand Vizier, which was
observable for its extraordinary Wealth, and for several marks which are
peculiar to the Generals of those Barbarians. He found no body in it, nor about
it, though it was well worth the pains of looking to, as well in regard of its
self, as of what it contained.

In the mean while the Duke of Lorrain advanced, and complemented his Electoral
Highness upon the happy success of that day, but having not leisure to enlarge
much upon that, he gave Dunewaldt orders to pursue the Runaways, and detached
ten thousand Horse for that Expedition. This General found some of the
Fugitives on the way, but making directly to the Bridge which the Turks had
over the Drove, he found the main body had passed it, and had broke the Bridge
after them. But the shore was all strewn with Clothes, and Bodies lay floating
over the River. Two Bassas, and several of the Principal Officers were taken
Prisoners, with about 800 common Soldiers, and the dead ten times as many. The
Conquerors got all the Canon, consisting in 90 Pieces of Ordnance, and twelve
Mortar-pieces, with Tents, Camels, Wagons, and Elephants in abundance, with
all other sorts of booty almost beyond Imagination. This Victory cost the
Imperialists not above 600 men, as they themselves say, and as others eighteen
hundred.

Thus does the God of Battles make each man
His Power and Might in every Action own,
And that it is he that rules the World alone.
THE SECOND PART.
THE Soldiers Encouragement: Or, the Nobleness of his Profession highly to be
prized and esteemed; in a modest and brief Essay, containing the necessity of
it in all Empires, Kingdoms, and Estates; with Directions to a young Soldier or
Officer, worthy os his notice, etc.
HAving thus far, Reader, proceeded to give you an Account, according to what I
find in the best Historians, of such memorable Battles, as upon which, for the
most part, depended the fates of Kingdoms; and the great Captains of sundry
Nations, thereby to raise in them a thirst for, and a desire to, Military
Glory, which is for the most part attended by Fame and Renown; I shall continue
to say something that may yet prove more profitable and advantageous especially
to the young Soldier; and first of his usefulness, and the Nobleness of his
Profession, etc.

As there are but chiefly four conditions, or main supports in a Civil Life,
viz. the Sword, the Gown, Trade and Husbandry, so these are so linked together,
that the one can but badly subsist without the other, and rarely the latter
without the former, for as the Gown makes and administers wholesome Laws, to
hinder the stronger from oppressing the weaker, and to deter evil-minded men
through sear of punishment, those Laws would be frequently violated and
contemned by such, as would violently break through them, to execute their own
wicked purposes and advantages, were not they protected by the Sword, which
over-aws offenders, by carrying with it a Power sufficient to put them in
execution, nor could the Merchants securely pass the Seas, to Enrich by Foreign
Traffic their Native Land, were they not frequently Convoyed, by a Power
sufficient to guard and protect them, from Pirates and Sea-Rovers, who contemn
all Laws, and measure the success of right and wrong by violence and force of
Arms, to the ruin of peaceable and industruous men, or how could the laborious
Husbandman gather the fruits of his Labor; and the Increase of the Earth, did
not the fear of Punishment restrain such, as otherways would spoil and waste
them, or convert to their own use, what never caused any sweat to descend upon
their brows, nor does any thing in a State more contribute to its greatness and
tranquillity, than an orderly and well governed Soldiery, who are at all times
ready to expose their Lives to the utmost hazard and danger, in righting
Injuries and affronts done to their Prince or Country; so that as well the
Enemies at home, as those abroad, desist through fear of punishment, from those
lawless enterprises, which otherwise they would be continually putting in
practice, to the great disquiet, if not subversion of the State or Kingdom, for
which tranquillity and quiet Repose, a Soldier may with the least Imputation to
be laid to his charge of arrogating vain glory to himself, conclude in some
measure his Country beholden to him, nor has it been held amiss to count the
profession of Arms one of the noblest, and most to be esteemed amongst all
others, not only for the causes I have mentioned, but for sundry other pregnant
Reasons, for by it Men's fortunes are Raised, many times from the lowest
degree, to the very top of Greatness: and not only their Fortunes, but their
Fame, which continues as a grateful Remembrance to their Country, and an honor
to their Posterity: nor can the profession be said to be beneath the Regard of
those of the Noblest rank, seeing the fortunes of Empires and Kingdoms are so
often cast in the Balance, and require not only Valor, but Caution,
Experience, and sound Judgment, to rescue them from many dangers. Nor must
those that would be truly accounted brave in this way, be unfurnished with good
qualities and moral Virtues, as Prudence, Conduct, Valor, hardiness, patience,
but above all, seeing a Soldier carries his Life in his hand, he must be
endued with Religious and Pious Principles, that his Conscience being at peace,
the terrors of Death, and consequently of a fearful Judgment after it, may not
terrify or deter him from undertaking any Enterprise that is brave and daring;
for although a man given up to wickedness, may, when danger is afar off, seem
bold and desperate, yet when Death stares him in the face, the thoughts of his
Immortal state will trouble him, and the twinges of Remorse makes his Courage
flag; there are many things more, necessary to be known, to which great Regard
ought to be had, and especially,

When a young Gentleman, in what station soever, enters the Army, without
prejudice to his Reputation, he ought to understand that he is obliged to show
great Respect to those that are his Superiors in Place or Command, a civil
Respect to his Equals, and to have a Love and Charitable Regard to his
inferiors, or such as are under his Command, that in so doing he may win their
affections, to stand by him in the greatest Extremity; for, especially where
the Soldiers love their Officer, they will never leave him in any action, and
gain to him a great deal of Reputation, when on the contrary they will many
times shrink from him in the heat of the fight, sacrificing their honor to
their Revenge; wherefore although his Courage be never so great, he is obliged
to yield to Invincible necessity, yet it is more honorable to be taken
Prisoner, than to turn his back and fly, for if he be once suspected of
Cowardice, it will be very difficult to raise his sinking Reputation, and in
many things it is better to confess Ignorance than be Presumptious to undertake
any thing he understands not, for those to whom he makes such an ingenious
acknowledgment, will rather compassionate than deride him, and take pleasure to
instruct him, to show their own Experience, and Reward his modesty, nor is it
any dishonor to ask advice, upon Important occasions, by way of opinion, nor
need he therein discover his own weakness, but by a kind of a secret Inquiry,
inform himself in what may prove advantageous: There are some General Rules
that ought to be known by all, especially by Commanders, viz. that a Captain of
Horse ought no more to dispute the command with a Captain of Foot in a Garrison,
than the other ought to do it with him in the Field, for in doing it he would
very much wrong his judgment, nor ought an elder Captain in a younger Regiment
to expect he should without peculiar Orders, or an extraordinary Commission
command a younger Captain in an elder Regiment, for their Rank is otherwise,
according to the Antiquity of the Regiment, and not according to the Date of
the Commission; nor is there a small respect required from subalternates, to
their Superiors respectfully, in all places, thereby to gain love, credit, and
applause, even of the meanest; and thus having made a small Essay, not
unnecessary to be taken notice of, by young Soldiers, and Officers: I shall
now proceed to speak something of Gunnery, whereby those that are desirous to
become Engeniers, may in some measure be advantaged, in their first
undertakings, and then to speak of Artificial Fireworks, and their use, as
they relate to War, and Recreation, that nothing material may be omitted, that
can be conceived necessary for the Adornment of this Work.

That Arts and Arms may equally be twyn'd,
Mars and Minerva in one Circle joined,
To give more luster to the warlike Scene,
By making public that which envies screene,
In darkness shades, as loath to let it see,
The longed for light, where it so fain would be.
THE YOUNG Engeniers Masterpiece: OR, A TREATISE of GVNNERY In all its
material Parts and Particulars, guiding and directing in what of that kind
relates as well to Sea as Land.
In knowing and managing any piece of Ordnance to the best Advantage on all
Occasions, and sundry other Matters, and things highly necessary to be known,
etc.
AS for the Person who will undertake to be an expert Gunner, it is highly
requisite that he be not unskilful in, or a stranger to the Mathematics,
whereby he will be incapacitated to work any Proportion by Rule, and
consequently be obliged to manage his undertaking by guess, rather than by any
certain Rule; nor is the Art of Geometry to be neglected, seeing height,
breadth, and depth, as well as lengths are to be observed in this kind of
mensuration, that so the plot of any piece of Ground or convenient distance may
be taken to advantage. And as for the Necessaries wherewith he ought to be
provided, I hope few or none that proceed to this undertaking are ignorant: yet
I think it not amiss to mention what is requisite, that none may plead
ignorance; and in this case they must have in a readiness the following
Materials, viz.

Spare Wheels and Axeltrees, Rammers, Ladles or Scoups, Sheepskins well wooled
for Sponges to clear the Piece, Canvas or strong Paper to make Cartrages when
the Piece is hot and will not Endure loose Powder without siring it as soon as
it is cast in, of which more hereafter: as for shot of all kinds, according to
the undertaking, he ought to be stored, together with Artificial Fireworks and
Torches, dark Lanthorns, etc. hand Spikes, Budgbarrels, Baskets, Match, and a
well armed Linestock, with a pair of Compasses called Caliber Compasses, to
take the exact Diamiter of the shot, and the bore of his piece, ever observing
to charge according to the thinnest part of the Metal, thereby to prevent
breaking; and another thing necessary is to be observed, viz. When a piece to
be fired lies upon a direct line, or under Metal, be sure to ram it with a
good wad, lest the Powder lying hollow, and not full up to the Metal, burst
it; and that he may move or traverse his piece at pleasure, he must have Crows
of Iron, Coins of Wood, and take special care to know the depth of the Chamber
or charging part; he must likewise be furnished with a scale whereby he may
know the force, weight, measure, and carriage of his piece, as also the
proportion on the charge, and the weight of the shot.

As for the Names of the great Pieces commonly in use, they are the Base, the
Rabanet, the Faulconet, the Faulcon, the ordinary Minnion, the Minnion of the
largest size, the Sacker the lowest sort, the ordinary Sacker, the Sacker of
the oldest sort, the lowest Demiculverin, the eldest sort of Demiculverin, the
ordinary Demiculverin, the Culverins of the best size, ordinary Culverin,
Culverin of the largest size, lowest Demicannon, ordinary Demicannon,
Demicannon of the great size, Cannon Royal, or of the largest size; and to
these, according to their weight and bore, ought to be proportioned the charge
of Powder and Shot; and by that Rule likewise one may know how far a Piece will
carry; as suppose a Piece be eight foot long, weighing 1500 weight, and four
inches Diamiter in the bore, charge it (for so much it requires) with 4 pounds
of Powder, and it will carry a shot of 61. 160 paces, of five foot to the pace,
provided it be not defective by Reason of Flaws or Honycombs, and so
proportionable the rest of greater or lesser weight.

As for a true piece, it is for the better distinction divided by Gunners into
several parts, and thus distinguished, viz. the outward most part of the breech
is called the Cascabel Deck, the Ring next to the Touchhole the base Ring, and
the space between the Touchhole and the next Ring is called the Chamber or
charging Cilinder, and the second Ring the Ramforce Ring, the third is called
the Tronion or balance Ring, that next the Muzzle is called the Cornice Ring,
the Extremity is called the Muzzle, the top the Superficies, and the whole
length the chase, by readily knowing which any assistant to a Gunner may
understand what he is required to do.

As for Shot they are generally three sorts, either Lead, Iron, or Stone,
according as the store can furnish, or the Emergency requires; and in these,
according to their weight, there is a disproportion in bigness, which to
prevent trouble in a hasty Enterprise, ought to be considered, lest in weighing
alike, they prove (especially the latter) useless, by being too big for your
Piece, and thus we consider them.

The proportion between Lead and Iron is six to nine, so that a shot of Iron of
six pound weight, is as big as a shot of Lead weighing nine pound, and the
proportion between Iron and Stone is three to eight, by which means a shot of
thirty pound of stone, is as big as a shot of eighty pound of Iron, and so
proportionable.

If there be any cracks, flaws, or honeycombs in a piece, which not only hinder
its carriage, but many times endanger its breaking, you may discover the
former, viz. stop the muzle and touchhole of the Piece, so soon as ever you
have shot it off, and if there be any such thing, the smoke will come through
insensible cranies, but if it be defective; by reason of the latter, viz.
honey-combs, which are a sponginess, or scaling of the metal within, you must
search it with a piece of candle, in a long cleft stick, or by reflecting the
Sunbeams into it with a Looking-glass, which will occasion so much light, that
one may thereby discover them, though there is little remedy to be had in these
cases, for the bettering the Piece, nor are they less to be discerned, by
striking the Piece with an Iron hand-spike in all parts, for if it sound hoarse
or jarring, then are there flaws and defects, but if it sound clear, then
account it a perfect Piece, and to it you may accordingly proportion your
charge, for if the Piece be not sound, or of no true bore, you must beware of
overcharging, least you endanger your self, and others.

As for Cartrages, seeing they are very useful, in loading Pieces when hot,
with often firing, and not able otherways to endure the powder, I shall speak
something of them, and their use.

Cartrages are usually made of stiff-paper or canvass, upon a wooden Mould,
proportionable to the Piece in the form of a Rocket-cartoush, but larger, the
first of these must be done by rolling the paper thick, and pasting it in each
rolling, fixing to it a firm bottom, and the last by sowing or glewing strong
canvass in the like nature; into the cavity put so much powder as is a
sufficient charge for the Piece, and stop it in lightly with paper, or flax,
and so thrust the hard end foremost into the chamber of the piece, leaving
about an inch vacant, that it may the better take air, and so with a sharp
priming Iron, pierce it through the touchhole and prime, then follow it with
your shot, and discharge as you see occasion, but by the way you must observe
that your Cases be dry, least by damping the powder they prevent its firing, as
also to make them according to the proportion of the piece, that so without any
difficulty, they may be ready at hand on all occasions; as for the Ramers,
Ladles and Sponges, all the difficulty in them, is to fit and proportion them
to the respective pieces, having good stuff in order thereto.

As for the wheels and carriages of pieces, they ought to be much regarded,
especially in case of a march, lest by their defect in breaking, they hinder
any extraordinary Enterprise, and it as often happens for want of a true
mounting wherefore take notice, that one and a half the length of the cilender
of the bore, or chamber of the piece, should be the length of the carriage, and
the depth four d^amiters of the bore or concave in the middle, but at the end
next the ground not above the thickness of the diamiter of the shot; as for the
wheels they ought to be strong, and one half of the length of the piece in
height if for Land-service, but if for Sea a less proportion will serve.

As for the Turneons they must be so placed that the piece may stand true
mounted, lest a false shot be often made, and in this case two thirds of the
piece must appear above their Center, nor must Cordage be wanting, especially
at Sea; and those being strong, ought to be four times the length of the piece,
and the britchings twice the length of the piece, though great Pieces for fear
of breaking loose, and overswaying the Ship, are often coined and braced so
straight that they cannot give much way, especially in case of a storm. Now to
charge and fire a piece dexterously, and like a Gunner, let those that
undertake it observe this Method.

Lay your budg-barrel or Cartrages of Powder to the Wind-ward, and your
Linstock with the fired Match to the Lee-ward, placing your self on the right
side of the Piece, and having cleansed the Concave and the Touchhole, fill
your Ladle, but so as no Corns may scatter over, then charge it into the piece
as home as you can, turning it by the end of the staff with your Thumb and
Fingers, being sure to keep your Body clear of the Muzzle, and so drawing out
your Ladle, ram a wad by three or four quick strokes of your Rammer to prevent
the Powder from scatte^^^^ in the Chamber; then put in the shot, and after it a
wad in like manner, so that the Powder may be forced yet closer, whereby it
will deliver the shot with greater violence, and prevent any Vacancy that may
occasion the bursting of the piece; and whilst this is doing, you must cover
the Touchhole to prevent any accidental fire from falling into it, then prime
by drawing a Train to the base Ring, and so give fire, ever observing not to
touch the Touchhole with your Match-coal, lest it blow both that and your
Linstock out of your hand, and disable it for some time of doing service,
especially if the Touchhole be any thing large.

If you are required to shoot at a random mark, or by Elevation, you ought to
understand that the Random of a piece is the entire distance from the place of
discharge to the place where the Bullet first falls or grazes on the level
Line, or on the Ground, by Artists termed the Horizential Plain, and to obtain
the true knowledge of this it must be practiced in a level Ground where nothing
may obstruct the level Line, or leveling of the shot, and therein observe the
distances of the paces from the Piece to the fall, then mount the Muzzle one
degree, and take again the like notice; and in still mounting by degrees, you
will be capable of perceiving how far the piece will carry mounting, or at the
level with an equal proportion of Powder, even to the tenth degree, or so high
as your piece is capable of mounting, which will in a good piece advance thirty
or forty paces, of five feet to the pace, through which means an experienced
Gunner by his Map may be certain at what distance to make his shot, whether
into the Trenches or a Town, or to dismount the Enemies Cannon, or to batter a
Wall, Bulwark, or the Ranks of an Army; but if he would make a good shot at a
party of moving Horse or Foot, or at a Ship under sail.

Observe in the first place your length, to know certainly whether or not you
are within reach, and if so it being in a straight Line, in the second place
consider the slowness or swiftness of the motion of the men or ship you intend
to hit, and thereupon lying upon an equal level, neither too high nor too low,
fire at another mark some distance before it, and beyond that, so by the two
motions the Bullet and the Mark you design to hit may meet, for although the
Bullet flys with incredible swiftness, yet it requires some small time to
accomplish its end.

But if you aim at any Light either on the Sea or on the Shore in a dark Night,
then fix a piece of lighted Match, or a bit of a Torch on the Muzzle of the
piece, and bringing that and the middle of the base Ring even with the light,
if it stand still, or be passing on in a direct line, and give fire, by which
means if your piece be steady and carry true, you can hardly miss your aim.

If a shot by reason of over-rash charging (with one above proportionable size)
stick in the piece, whereby if it be fired hastily it indangers the breaking,
dissolve bay Salt in Vinegar, and pour it in at the Touchhole till it has
melted the Powder, then strike the piece where the Bullet sticks, the piece
being lowred with the muzzle downwards, and it will fall out; if not, let the
piece dry, and then put Powder in at the Touchhole till you find a small
charge, and so give fire, having struck the Bullet before with your Rammer to
loosen it.

It is worth observing that if a piece by reason of its being often shot off be
very hot, it loses much of its force every time (after the second or third
time) lessening something of its motion as to the distance; wherefore if the
occasion will permit, it is best to let them cool between every shot, but if
not, cool them as well as you can with your Spong diped in Water, etc.

If at any time a Gunner for want of skill, or by mistake has placed his piece
amiss, so that the shot flys wide of the mark, to mend it he must observe how
much wide he was, if the shot has hit any part near the mark, and if it be too
high, then must he bring the piece a degree lower, or according to the
distances he perceives he erred in; but if on one side, then must the piece be
breeched about, and if too low it must be better leaveled, ever observing that
in making a true shot it is requisite to bring the middle of the base Ring even
with the middle of the muzzle Ring, both which being exactly measured, may be
notified by sticking up a nail by the help of a piece of Wax or Clay, and both
those brought even with the mark, only the top of the former to be seen, give
fire, and your Expectation, if the piece be a clever shooter, will be answered.

Many it is true, leavel their Ordnance by Rule, and indeed it is the exactest
way, though somewhat tedious, yet may it be done without any Rule by the help
of a steady Eye, especially if the piece be true, and a far shooter, only it
requires the Gunner to be skilful in guessing at the distance of the mark,
whither it be in a right Line, mounting or declining, by bringing the mark even
with the Muzzle and Base-ring exactly in the middle.

It is not the least of the Gunners care to procure good powder, such as may
easily take fire, and retain its full strength, for powder in long lying,
taking unseasonable wet or the like, will lose so much of its strength, that a
pound and a half will not work the effect of one pound, nay, that which is at
the bottom of the Barrel is much more forcible than that which is at the top,
and the reason is, because the force of the Saltpeter, if it be not moved or
stired about, tends downward, now to know good powder from bad, observe these
Rules: First, feel whether the Corns are well dried, being of a dark bluish
color, and taste much of the fire; secondly, take some of the Corns, and lay
them upon a sheet of white paper, and if when you fire them, they leave a black
mark or yellow sindge behind them, then is the powder gross and earthy, and
will neither endure well, nor be of any great force, but if it leave no mark,
or at least a white one resembling white smoke, then is the powder good, and
will fire both quick and with great force.

If the Powder be naught and unfit for ^se, to fine and strengthen it take it
and bruise it to dust with a wooden beam or beater; then add to every pound an
ounce of Saltpeter reduced into meal, sifting them together through a fine
Sieve or Boulter till they are very well mixed, then having a Sieve of
Parchment punched full of holes, mix the Ingredients with water, till with a
wooden Bowl you may press them through the holes in corns, which lying in an
indifferent warm and dry place will harden of themselves, and so that powder
which was very weak will become very strong, and do Execution equal with any,
or to make it the stronger you may use Aqua vitae instead of water, and making
it up into balls, keep them in a dry Chest for your use.

White Powder is compounded of Saltpeter, six times so much as of Brimstone,
and twelve times so much as of Camphire, all finely beaten and incorporated to
a degree, that no knops or knots may be found therein, then moisten them with
Brandy or Aqua vitae, and when you have so ordered the Ingredients, corn them
as the former, or make them up into fine balls for your use, etc. If you design
to charge a Mine, which is many times a Gunner's business, you may do it either
with Bags, Sacks or Barrels of Powder, though to prevent dampness the latter is
the best, because the Powder in some Mines, where the ground is low, is obliged
to lie upon floats, by reason of the Springs that are there met withal, then
must the Powder be laid, so that by a Trane through canes or wooden troughs,
the Bags or Casks may communicate with each other, and charged over with beams
of wood, that it may rise directly, and not swerve to either part, or bursting
at the vent, it answer not your expectation, as for him that fires it, he may
do it by a Match laid to the Train, and know by that how many hours it will be
ever it take fire, for six Inches of good Match will last an hour burning, or
he may do it at a distance, through a cane train, or upon board.

If a House be designed to be blown up, to prevent the progress of a fire, then
the Barrel ought to be placed in the Vault or Cellar, under the main Beam, with
a strong piece of wood set up against that beam, from a cross beam that covers
the beam, that covers the barrel, to give the fire more force, which must if
you would take it upright, be placed as near as you can in the middle or center
of the Building, but if you would overthrow it, or turn it into a Street or
Garden, then must it be placed near to that side you design to raise, and so by
loosening the foundation, it will overturn it, as for the Train in this case,
it may be laid upon boards, from the Powder covered, as it is laid with a
woollen cloth, to prevent the sparks of fire from falling into it before the
time intended, by which much mischief may happen both to the Engenier, and
those that are assistant to him, as some times too sadly has happened.

In case a Ship that is sunk in a River, or near the shore, is not worth
weighing, or cannot be well weighed, many hold it may be blown in pieces in the
water, after this manner, viz. Let down the quantity of two Barrels of Powder,
or more in a Brandy-punchin, or some such stench-Cask, doing it by the guidance
of Ropes, sinking it with a greater weight into her Hold, if possible, or if
that cannot conveniently be done, it may be placed under her side, though the
former is better, and there being a long pipe of leather fixed into the bung of
the Cask with rosin and pitch, that the water cannot penetrate, let the upper
part of it be above water, supported by the floating of bladders, and when all
is fixed, have an Iron-bolt ready, that will easily slide down the pipe into
the powder, which being red-hot will fire it, but as soon as ever you have
delivered it, with a long pair of Pincers, it is the best way for you to make
off with your Boat, least it be overturned with wrecks that will arise from the
shattered Ship, or you basted with the sudden smoke that will arise out of the
water, forced and rent in a fearful manner with the fury of the fire, that
strugles to recover and join with its proper Element.

If you will weigh any Ship or Ordnance, it must be done by lashing together
Lighters, empty Casks, or wooden Floats at low water, having slung what you
intend to weigh, load them likewise, that they may sink the deeper, and the
Cords or Chains may be drawn more straight, by which means at high water, being
unloaded, they will rise and raise with them what they are fastened to, if
their proportion be equal, five Tun above the water, being computed to raise
three times the weight in the water, by which method a greater, or lesser
weight may be raised.

It is requisite that a Gunner should know the weight of his piece, the better
to enable him to understand what force or strength it requires to draw it, or
Remove it from place to place, and in this case many are marked, but some
defective therein, wherefore if he have no opportunity of weighing them, he may
according to the proportion of those that are weighed, measure and guess
according to computation, as near as may be, and then consider that a piece of
10000 weight requires no less than 18 Horse and Oxen to draw it, especially in
Winter time they must be in good case and strength to perform it, and where
many times by reason of the steepness, the piece cannot be drawn by Beasts, it
will require 100 men's strength to effect it.

Many other things of this kind I might set down, but seeing these are the most
material, and my intention being no other than to instruct Beginners, who are
not Proficients in Experience; I shall say no more at this time, but proceed to
another useful part of Engenry, no less useful for a Gunner to know, by reason
at one time or other it may greatly advantage him: and this consists in making
Artificial fireworks, useful in War by Land and Sea, as likewise very pleasant
for Recreation.

More Brats of Typhons brood are yet behind,
Such as for Mankinds Ruin were designed;
Though little thought our tender Mother, Earth,
In days of old to teem with such a Birth.
She careful of her Sons, long time did shroud
What now in Flame and Thunder speaks so loud.
Directions to prepare Artificial Fireworks, useful in Sieges or Fights at
Sea. or Land, on sundry Occasions; and not only to make them the plainest and
easiest way, but to use them to advantage, and to know to what particular ends
they are designed, according to the Ancient and Modern Engenry, etc.
AS for Fireworks of Warlike use, especially in the siege of any Town, etc.
they are commonly sent out of Brass Mortars or great Ordnance, and some of
those for Recreation out of Mortars made of Wood or strong Past-board, and
sometimes Canvas.

Those Mortars that are made of Brass are to be of the finest Metal, thereby
to be free from cracks and flaws, and in them it is to be observed that if any
of their bores be ten Inches in the Diamiter, the Mortar ought to be one foot
nine Inches in length, and the Chamber to be laden with Powder three Inches
and a half Diamiter, and five Inches deep, the thickest of the Metal above the
fire Port, ought to be three Inches and a half, and so by degrees to lessen or
grow thinner to two Inches.

As for Mortars of Wood they are bored and turned much in the fashion of the
former, greater or lesser as occasion requires it, but ought to be plated
within and without with Tin or Copper, or they will be always in danger of
bursting, and do but little Service.

Mortars of Past-board are made upon Rowlers glewed still in the rolling, and
corded over with Pitch and tarred Cords, and having cut off both ends so that
they may be smooth and even, turn a foot and sholder to fasten the Trunk upon,
and in the middle thereof let your Chamber be made for the Powder strongly
plated within and without; and if the Mortar be six Inches diamiter, the
Past-board must be an Inch and three quarters thick, and the Trunk about
sixteen Inches long, the Chamber two Inches Diamiter must be three Inches deep,
and when the Trunk is upon the breech of Wood, it must be fastened on with
Coopers Nails, and corded over with pitch Cord, leaving so much space as may
serve to bore a Touchhole, but these are seldom used but in Fireworks of
Recreation, unless great necessity require them to throw small Bombs, and that
mostly on Shipboard; but as for a Balloon, one of them will carry it an
exceeding hight.

A Granado in the first place is a hollow shell of Iron, Brass, and sometimes
of Glass, in which there is left a hole to put in a faucet or Pistol barrel to
carry the fuse, in the Composition is commonly Brimstone, Saltpeter and dry
Powder, the quantity of each being left in the mixture to the Discretion of the
Engenier, as he intends either to fire or blow up any House, etc. and sometimes
they are filled only with whole Powder; as for the fuse it is to be
proportioned to the length the Granado is to fly, lest sooner expiring it fire
the Granado, and break it in the Air, and is commonly made of Powder wet with
Oil of Petrolum, but sometimes made of Char^ole, Brimstone and Powder beaten
and finely sifted.

In charging your Mortar you must consider what quantity of Powder will carry
the Granado, and so much being put into the Chamber, press it down with a wad
of Flax, and after that place a Turf quite over it, filling the bottom of the
Mortar, and so sling in your Granado by the help of Cords, observing the fuse,
which must be charged into it within an Inch of the head, stand directly in the
middle, when having primed and touched the fuse, give immediately fire to the
Mortar, whose Touchhole you must be sure to keep always in good order, lest
the fuse burn out before the Powder in the Chamber take fire, and so endanger
not only the breaking of the Mortar, but the destroying of your self and others.

There are an other sort of Granados, though to the same effect, made of Canvas
and strong Past-board, wetted with Oil of Spike, or it may be done with Brandy
or Water, mold them upon a round ball of Wood with Glue and Pitch in each
doubling, and when they are well dried, cut them in half to take out the Ball,
then put them together with Glue, and cover them over with other strong Canvas
coated with Pitch, and so bind them strongly together with Cords, leaving a
hole to charge at, and for the fuse, and these many times do the same Execution
as Shells, and ought to be managed the same way? but are sometimes filled with
Wildfire, Pitch, Rosin, etc. being then rather designed to fire than blow up.

Hand Granados are in effect the same with the former, though much less, their
Shells are made of concave Iron, with a fuse of Paper, Reed or Quills, and
sometime are made of Glass, Earth, or Wood, but those for Sea are more commonly
of Canvas or Past-board, which are kept hollow by rolling upon a bottom of
Twine, and pasted or glewed still in the rolling till they become an Inch thick
in the case, when being dried, one end of the thread left at a hole for that
purpose is drawn out many there are that stick pieces of Lead, or half
Musquet-bullets about them, that when they burst, those many forcibly scatter
and wound the Enemy. As for their Composition it is generally Powder, Brimstone
and Saltpeter, but may be filled with dry Powder if occasion require it; the
fuse being at the same time made of Wildfire, and grafted in with Pitch or soft
Wax, leaving the head of it about a quarter of an Inch above the Shell.

There has been formerly used in firing Towns and Castles a strange way, which
is now altogether left off, yet it may not be amiss to recite it, viz. Instead
of a Mortar the Engeniers were wont to dig a deep cavety in the Ground slant
ways, with the mouth of it toward the Town in the manner of a mouted Cannon,
bricking or stoneing it round in the form of a Well, in the bottom of which
they placed a Barrel, or as much as was convenient of Powder, laying Beams a
cross over it, and upon those Beams a quantity of Turf and Earth, then having a
huge Faggot of Timber prepared, bound strongly with Iron-chains, it was put
into this place all on a fire, and so by the means of a Train, the Powder
firing, blew it into the place designed with great force, the ground serving in
those days instead of a Mortar, but probably without any certain Aim.

The Seamen, for firing Ships, were wont to make flaming Arrows in this sort,
viz. taking the head and shaft of a broad Arrow, and the Iron of the head being
very long, they made an Oval-case of strong Canvas and Past-board, glewing it
firmly in all parts, and this being filled with a composition of Salt peter,
Gun powder, Brimstone, made into Wildfire with the Oil of Petrollum, is fixed
upon the neck of the head, the case being punched full of holes, and when
fired, and flung with a strong hand, it will stick in the side mast of a Ship,
and if not suddenly prevented, will set it on fire.

Stink-pots are made of Earth, and filled with Tar, Turpentine, and beaten
Brimstone, in which is a great wad of Hemp, and ends of Rope, which being fired
and thrown on board, breaks upon the Deck with a stream of flame, sending
withal such a stench and noisome smoke, that it not only indangers the Ship,
which it many times fires, but forces the Men from their stations, and gives
the throwers an opportunity to enter.

Carcasses, now much in use, are made up with Leather and Canvas, strongly
bound, glewed and pitched, filled with a composition of Powder, Brimstone,
Saltpeter, Rozin, Pitch, Turpentine, and the like, and thrown out of Mortars
and Engines.

The Art of making and preparing Artificial Fireworks for Recreation, after
the newest and best Invention, in sundry forms and manners, pleasant and
profitable, etc.
AS for Artificial Fire works, there are sundry sorts relating to Recreation,
but in general, I may reduce them under three heads, viz. those that ascend in
the Air, those that expire on the Earth, and such as swim in the water, and
these again I may as properly divide into three particular sorts, viz. Those
for the Air are the Balloon, the Sky-rocket and the flying Saucission, for the
Earth the fiery Lances, the ground Rocket, and the ground Saucissions; for the
Water, double and single Rockets, Globes or Balls, but before I proceed to the
composition, I shall say something of the Moulds, etc.

If the caliber or bore of your Mould be an Inch in Diameter, then ought it to
be six Inches in length, being made for a Rocket of the Air, and the breech one
Inch and a half, the Broach being no less than 3 Inches long, and in thickness
a quarter of an Inch circumference, the Rowler in this case must be three
quarters of an Inch Diameter, and the Rammer half an Inch, being hollow at one
end to receive the Broach, for the carroush coffin must be loaded, the Broach
being in; if the bore be two Inches Diameter, the Rocket must be a Foot long,
if but half an Inch, it must be in length but three Inches, and so
proportionable, as it is more or less in the Diameter, as also the Breech must
be coherent, or else they will never mount well.

In the composition of a Sky-Rocket, the principal thing to be considered, is
an exact and proportionable mixture, therefore for the composition of middle
sized Rockets, add no more than two ounces of Charcole to a pound of Powder,
both being bruised and searced through a fine Sieve of Lawn, or such a like
material, with which fill your Rocket, the Head and Broach being in, putting in
the Powder by degrees, and pressing it down between each, filling with your
Rammer, then try it, and if it break or burn out too fast, add more Charcole
dust, but if it burn dull and refuse to mount, then add more Powder, and so
order it, till you find it answer your expectation, and for defect of Charcole,
you may use Seacole, finely beaten, but it will not make so bright a Tail, for
as the Powder forces the Rocket to mount, so the Charcole makes the fiery
train. If you would have it sparkle much in mounting, you may put some
Saltpeter meal into it, if you would have your Rocket give a Report after the
Fuse is spent, you must put a piece of Paper, when it is three parts charged,
with the composition, and making a hole in the middle of it, put after it a
Pistol charge, or so much as will fill it, of corned Powder unbruised, and so
doubling in the breech, seal it down with wax, pitch, or glow, observing always
the Cases be well choked in the Primer, or you may, for want of wax, or the
like, choke the But end with a Cord, and so cut it off.

To fire your Rocket for the Air, fasten to it a straight wand, sufficient to
poise it, and fix it with the mouth, and the Tail of the wand downward, upon
some place above your height, and so with a Fuse or Match give fire, or by a
Train you may fire six or seven together, making them spread in the Air, like
fountains of fire.

Ground Rockets, as to their Moulds, are made in the manner of the former, but
the composition somewhat differs, for in this case Powder dust and
Salt-Peter-meal very fine sifted are required, which must be forcibly rammed by
degrees, till within an Inch of the Top, and then a Pistol charge of corned
Powder being put in Choke up the end exceeding close with a small cord, and
cutting off what hangs over, leave it picked.

In this manner Serpents, commonly used to adorn great Fireworks, are made,
but if you intend them to mount, let your filling be only beaten Powder well
fisted, and if you design them with a Train, then it will require some Charcole
dust, at least an ounce to six ounces of Powder.

To make the Resemblance of Golden Rain, and Stars of diverse sorts, having
filled a great Rocket for the Air, with a charge of hard Powder, make upon the
breech of him a kind of a Gallery, by drawing over a greater case, or pasting
on stiff paper, then having filled about thirty or forty Goose quills, or so
many as it will hold, with beaten Powder, Brimstone, and Saltpeter, bore the
end of the Rocket full of holes, and paste them into that vacancy, that they
may not fall off till the Rocket is spent, and then by some Powder scattered
under them, they taking fire will appear to those that are on one side of the,
like the streamers of a Comet or golden rain, and to such as are under them
like a show of fire.

As for Stars, they are especially two sorts, made of dry and wet Powder; to
make the first of these, take a pound of Saltpeter, half a pound of Brimstone,
a quarter of a pound of bruised Gunpowder, beaten finely, and well sifted, sow
up as much of this composition in a double Rag, pierced full of holes, as the
quantity of a Walnut, and wet the Rag over on the ourside with the Oil of
Petrolum, fix of these six or eight upon the head of a great Rocket, so that
when it is at its highest, they may take fire, at what time they will expand
themselves in flame, and appear for a time to the Spectators like real Stars.

The second sort of Stars are compounded of Saltpeter, half a pound of
Brimstone and half a pound of Powder grossly bruised, and wet with the Oil of
Petrolum, and made up into Pellets as big as Wall-nuts, dry them by rolling in
the dust of dry Powder, and fix five, six, or seven of them upon a great
Rocket, and send it up into the Air, by which means when it is spent, these
Stars will fire, yet will not blaze bright as the former, but fall more like a
body of Fire, by reason of the Composition of moisture.

Stars there are of an other sort, which give reports at the going off like
Pistols, and these are composed of Saltpeter, Brimstone and Powder made into
Wildfire with Aqua fortis and Oil of Tartar, fastened to the heads of short
Cases filled with dry Powder, and of these a large Rocket will carry up eight
or nine, and give fire to them upon its expiring; but they ought for the better
securing them till they fire, to be put into a great case, one part of which
may shut over the stern of the Rocket.

To make Fire-boxes, ^ire-launces, and Fountains of Fire, observe the following
directions.

The Fire-box consists of a great many small Rockets put into a great Cartoush,
which fired by Trains, fly out one by one, and sometimes altogether, with
prodigious noise and fury.

The Fire-launce in all respects is to be molded as the ground Rocket, only
the Cartoush must be Past-board glewed as it is rolled, and bound about with
small Cords, nor must there be any broach in it whilst it is a filling. The
Composition if you desire it to have a long fiery train upon the Water, must be
one pound of Saltpeter, half a pound of Brimstone-dust, and half a pound of
Powder all finely beaten together, with two ounces of Charcole dust, but if you
would have it burn bright like a Candle, then to one pound of Saltpeter, and
half a pound of Brimstone, put a quarter of a pound of Powder, and fasten to
each of them a Rod in the nature of a Sky-Rocket, and they will when fired live
along while upon the Water, and appear in a dark Night exceeding pleasant.

To make Trees or Fountains of Fire, fix diverse small Rockets on the head of a
great one, by running their Rods through a broad overbearing of ^ast-board, and
if they fire whilst the Rocket is ascending, they will spring up and spread in
streams of Fire, resembling the branches of a Tr^^, but if they fire when the
Rocket is just spent and descending they will appear like the Streams of a
Fountain in Fire.

A Fire-wheel or Gerondel is very pleasant, especially to adorn the Angles of
great Fireworks, and is ordered after this manner: Prepare a wodden Wheel in
the fashion of a spinning Wheel, but the rim some what narrower, and fasten
round it Rockets of the smallest size, so that the tail of the one may by a
train wraped up in Paper, fire the head of the other, when as the Wheel being
put upon a pin of wood, the Rockets will fire one by one, and the force of them
will carry it round with incredible swiftness till all be spent; observe to put
them upon the Wheel in the nature of a Wheel-band, etc.

The Balloun is accounted the most excellent of all Fire works, tending to
Recreation, and must be shot out of a Past-board Gun or Mortar, to make which I
have already given directions.

As for the making the Balloun, you must prepare strong Paper or Past board,
and roll it upon a wooden Rowler eight Inches in Circumference, or somewhat
more, glewing it between every rolling, then choke the Cartoush at one of the
ends, leaving a little hole for a port-fire, which must be of durance by way of
fuse till the Balloun can come to its height, which done, put in as many
Serpents as the Cartoush will hold, and amongst them three or four Saucissions
to break it, making them not to differ in length from the Serpents, fill them
with the Composition of the Air Rockets, pressing the touch, if dry, strongly
into the throats of each of them, unless you make your fuse of Wildfire, and
then it needs not, observing ever to let the necks of the Saucissions to be
longer than those of the Serpents, that so they may all take fire before the
Balloun is broken, and upon the Crown of each place a considerable number of
either sort of Stars, and small quills of Brimstone-powder and Saltpeter, then
choke the other end as strongly as may be, and prime it with stouple or
Cottenweek dipped in wet Powder, and afterward very well dried again, and so
having charged your Mortar or Past-board Gun, with the muzel mounted upwards,
^end it into the Air, and when it is at its height it will break, and present
diverse delightful Figures, representing sundry shapes and forms.

Flying Saucissions are made as to the Cartoush, in the manner of a ground
Rocket, but the filling must be whole Powder, except so much dust-Powder and
Charcole as will serve for a port-fire till they can be delivered at their
height in the Air, which must be done out of Past-board Guns set in a Row upon
a bench or piece of Wood, and fired by a train underneath, and they will give
reports in the Air like Muskets.

The Guns must be made upon Rowlers of Wood, with strong Past-board about a
foot and a half, or two foot in length, worked in the rolling with Glue, or
well made Past-board, and being corded over, they must be choked with a strong
Cord at one end, only leaving a small hole at the bottom to give fire; as for
the bore of each it must be proportioned to the Saucissions.

If you would have Rockets run upon a Line backward and forward, you must
choose a smooth and even line, and stripe. it over with Soap to make it run
more glib, fasten two Rockets of the Composition of the Sky Rockets, head and
tail, one on the one side, and the other on the other side of a small Cane,
through which the Line must pass; so that when one is spent by running one way
on the Line, the other may fire and come back again; and upon these you may
place the forms of Dragons, Ships, or Men, which in the Nightime will appear
dreadful to the Beholders.

In case you are distressed for Match to use on these or the like Occasions,
take hempen Cords that have not been pitched or dawbed with Tar, pull them to
pieces, and then twist the loose stuff to the bigness of a man's Thumb, and boil
it in Wood-ly-ashes, adding a small quantity of Saltpeter until the Lie be
consumed, then make it up, and draw it through your hand, holding part of the
pieces or remainder therein twice or thrice, and dry it in the Sun.

Stopple or priming week is no other than Cotton-wool boiled in Water and
Gunpowder, and afterward dried in the Sun, or by the Fire: And thus Reader I
hope I have performed this undertaking to your Satisfaction.

FINIS.
