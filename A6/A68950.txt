A new balade of the worthy service of late done by Master Strangwige in
France, and of his death.
ENgland has lost a Soldiour of late
Who Strangwige was to name:
Although he was of mean estate
His deeds deserved fame.
For as the Plowman plowes ye ground
And toyleth to til for corn:
So Stra^gwige sought a deadly wound
For Britain where he was borne.
In deed of birth he was borne bace
Although of worshipful kyn:
In youth he sought to run the race
Where he might prowes wyn.
In his young years he walked wide
And wandered often a stray:
For why, blind Cupid did him guide
To walk that wyldsome way.
Thus here and there I wot not where
He sounded where to ride:
But happy haven he found no where
Nor harbor for to abide.
But when he had the course out run
Where Pirates prict the Card:
Twyse at the least, he thought undone
And looked for his reward.
For by legal laws he was condemd
Yet Mercy bare the mace
And in respect he would amend
He found a Princes grace.
And in that state he bowed to GOD
And to his righteous Queen:
He would no more deserve such rod
Nor at Justice bar be seen.
He thus contented for a while
And laughed Fortune to scorn:
Till weeds did work by subtle guyle
To ouergrow the corn.
And then occasion served just
That Martial men must trudge:
He vaunced himself with valiant lust
To go he did not grudge.
And to the sea he sought a charge
Where he might take his chance:
And therewith spread his sails at large
To seek a port in France.
And passed by a warlyke town
Where municion lay a land
He spoyld and cut their chains a down
And passed by strong hand.
Where as he caught a deadly wound
Yet his courage never quayled:
But as he had been safe and sound
On his way forth he sailed.
And passed through even to that port
Where he vowed to aryue:
And still he did his men coumfort
And courage did them give.
Then ATROPOS did him assail
That al Adams kind does call:
Against whose force may none prevail
But subject to him all.
This life (quod he) which was me lent
From judgment seat in perrill:
I came with heart for that intent
To spend in my Queens quarrel.
Therefore this debt here will I pay
This life which is not mine:
O Lord receive my spirit to joy
That by Christ's death is thine.
All Subjects now, look and forsee
That to trade the wars pretend:
Offenders eke (if any there be)
Make ye no worse an end.
FINIS.
