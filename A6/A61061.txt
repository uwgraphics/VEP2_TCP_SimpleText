THE COVNTER-SCVFFLE.
LEt that Majestic pen that writes
Of brave K. Arthur and his Knights,
And of their noble feats and fights:
And those who tell of Mice and Frogs
And of the skirmishes of Hogs,
And of fierce Bears, and Mastive Dogs,
Be silent.
And now let each one listen well,
While I the famous Battle tell,
In Woodstreet Counter that befell
In high Lent.
In which great Scuffle only twain,
Without much hurt, or being slain,
Immortal honor did obtain
By merit,
One was a Captain in degree,
A strong and lusty man was he,
The Other a Tradesman bold and free
Of Spirit.
And though he was no man of force,
He had a stomach like a Horse,
And in his rage had no remorse
Or pity.
Full nimbly could he cuffe and clout,
And was accounted, without doubt,
One of the prettiest sparks about
The City.
And at his weapon any way
He could perform a single fray,
Even from the long pike to the Tay
-lors Bodkin.
He reckt not for his flesh a jot,
He feared nor Englishman nor Scot,
For Man or Monster, cared he not
A Dodkin,
For fighting was his recreation,
And like a man in Desperation,
For Law, Edict, or Proclamation
He cared not
And in his Anger (cause being given)
To lift his hand' against good Sir Steven,
Or any Justice under Heaven,
He feared not.
He durst his enemy withstand,
Or at Tergoos or Calis sand,
And bravely there with sword in hand
Would greet him.
And noble Ellis was his name,
Who'mongst his foes to purchase fame,
Nor cared though the Devil came
To meet him.
And this brave Goldsmith was the man,
Who first this worthy brawle began,
Which after ended in a Can
Of mild Beer.
But had you seen him when he fought,
How eagerly for blood he sought,
There Is no man but would have him thought
A wild Bear.
Imagine now you see a score
Of madcap Gentlemen, or more,
Boys that did use to royst and rore,
And swagger.
Among the which were three or four,
That ruled themselves by wisdoms lore,
Whose very Grandsires scarcely wore
A dagger.
A Priest and Lawyer, men well read,
In wiping poones and chipping bread,
And falling to, short grace being sed,
Full roundly:
Whose hungry mawes no Sallets need
Good appetites therein to breed,
Their stomachs without sauce could feed
Profoundly.
'Twas ill that men of sober diet,
Who loved to fill their guts in quiet,
Were placed with Ruffins that to riot
were given:
And (O great grief!) even from their food,
(Their Stomachs too, being strong and good)
And that sweet place whereon it stood,
Be driven.
But here it is fitting I repeat,
What food our dainty Prisoners eat;
But if in placing of the meat
And Dishes,
From curious order I do swerve,
It Is that themselves did none observe,
For which nor flesh they did deserve,
Nor fishes.
But some (perhaps) will say that Lent,
Affords them not what here is meant,
So much, so good, and that they went
without it
It Is like; but if I add a Dish,
Or twain, or three, of Flesh or Fish,
They either had, or did it wish,
Never doubt it.
Then wipe your mouths, while I declare,
The goodness of this Lenten fare,
Which is in Prison very rare,
I tell ye.
Furmity as sweet as any Nut. The Supper.

As good as ever swill'd a Gut.
And butter sweet as e're was put
In belly.
Eggs by the dozen, new and good,
Which in white Salt uprightly stood,
And meats which heat and stir the blood
To action.
As buttered Crabs, and Lobsters red,
Which send the married pair to bed,
And in loose bloods have often bred,
A Faction.
Fish buttered to the Platters brim,
And Parsnips did in Butter swim,
Strewn ore with Pepper neat and trim
Salt Salmon.
Smelts cryde, come eat me, do not stay,
Fresh Cod, and Maids full nearly lay,
And next to these a lusty Ba
-con Gammon
Stuck thick with Cloves upon the back,
Well stuffed with Sage, and for the smack,
Daintily strewn with Pepper black,
Sous'd Gurnet,
Pickrell, Sturgeon, Tench, and Trout,
Meat far too good for such a rout,
To tumble, toss, and throw about
And spurn it.
The next a Neats-tongue neatly dryde,
Mustard and Sugar by his side.
Rochets buttered, Flounders fryde.
Hot Custard.
Eeles boiled and broyl'd: and next they bring
Herring, that is the Fishes King,
And then a Courtly Poll of Ling,
And Mustard.
But stay, I had almost forgot
The flesh which still stands piping hot,
Some from the Spit, some from the Pot
New taken,
A shoulder, and a Leg of Mutton,
As good as ever Knife was put on,
Which never were by a true Glutton
Forsaken,
A Loyne of Veale, that would have dared
One of the hungriest of the Guard,
And they sometimes will feed full hard,
Like tall men.
And such as love the Lusty Chine:
But when that I shall sup or dine,
God grant they be no Guests of mine,
Of all men.
Thus the Descriptions are complete,
Which I have made of men and meat.
Mars aid me now, while I repeat
The Battle,
Where Pots and Stools were used as Gins,
To break each others Heads, and Shins,
Where blows did make bones in their skins
To rattle.
Where men to madness never ceast,
Till each (furious as a Beast)
Had spoyld the fashion of a Feast,
Full dainty.
Whereon had they not been accursed,
They might have fed, till bellies burst:
But Ellis showed himself the worst
Of twenty.
For he began this monstrous brall,
Which afterward incensed them all,
To throw the meat about the Hall,
That Even.
And now give ear unto the jarre,
That fell between these men of war,
Wherein so many a harmless skarre
was given.
The Board thus furnished, each man sat,
Some fell to feeding, some to prate,
Mong whom a jarring question strait
was risen.
For they grew hotly in dispute,
What Calling was of most repute:
It Was well their wits were so acute
In prison.
While they discoursed, the Parson blythe Parson.

Fed, as he meant to have the tithe
Of every dish, being sharp (as Sithe)
In feeding.
But haste had almost made him choke,
Or else perhaps, he would have spoke
In praise of his long-thred-bare Cloak,
And breeding.
But after a deliberate pause,
The Lawyer spoke, as he had cause, Lawyer.

In commendation of the Laws
Profession.
The Law, quoth he, by a just doom,
Does censure all that to it come,
And still defends the innocent from
Oppression.
It favors Truth; it curbs the hope
Of Vice; it gives Allegiance scope;
Provides a Gallows and a Rope
For Treason.
This does the Law, and this is it
Which makes us here in prison sit,
Which grounded is on holy Writ
And Reason.
To which all men must subject be,
As we by daily proof do see,
From highest to low'st degree;
The Scholar,
Noble, and Rich: It does subdue
The Soulidier, and his swaggering crew,
But at that word the Captain grew
In choler.
He looked full grim, and at first word The Soldier

Rapt out an Oath, that shook the board,
And struck his fist, that the sound roared
Like thunder.
It made all skip that stood him near,
The frighted Custard quaked for fear,
And those that heard it, stricken were
With wonder.
Naught did he now, but frown and puff,
And having star'd and swore enough,
Thus he began in language rough.
Thou cogging,
Base foysting Lawyer, that do set
Thy mind on nothing, but to get
Thy living by thy damned pet
-tifogging.
A Slave, that shall for half a Crown,
With Buckram bag, and daggled Gown,
Wait like my dog about the Town,
And follow
A business of the Devils part,
For fees, though not with Law nor Art:
But head as empty as thy heart
Is hollow,
You stay at home and pocket fees,
While we abroad our bloods do leese,
And then, with such base terms as these
You wrong us.
But Lawyer, it is safer far
For thee to prattle at a Bar,
Than once to show thy face i'th'warre,
Among us,
Where to defend such thanklesse Hinds,
The Soldier little quiet finds,
But is exposed to stormy winds,
And weathers,
And often in blood he wades full deep,
Your throats from foreign swords to keep,
And wakes when you securely sleep
In feathers.
What could your Laws or Statutes do,
Against Invasions of the Foe,
Did not the valiant Soldier go
To quell' em?
And to prevent your further harms,
With Ensign, Fife, and loud Alarmes
Of warlike Drum, by force of Arms
Repell' em?
Your Trespass Action will not stand,
For setting foot upon your Land,
When they in scorn of your Command
Come hither.
No remedy in Courts of Powles,
In Common Pleaes, or in the Rowles,
For joulling of your Iobbernowles
Together.
Were not for us, thou Swad, quoth he,
Where would thou fog to get a fee?
But to defend such things as thee,
It Is pity.
For such as thou, esteem us least,
Who ever have been ready pressed,
To guard you, and the Cuckowes nest,
Your Ctiy.
That very word made Ellis start, Citizen

And all his blood ran to his heart,
He shook, and quaked in every part
With anger.
He looked as if naught might assuage
The heat of his enflamed rage,
His very countenance did presage
Some danger.
A Cuckowes nest? quoth he: and so,
He humm'd, and held his head full low,
As if distracted thoughts did o
-verpresse him.
At length, quoth he, my Mother sed, Ellis a Bristow man.

At Bristow she was brought abed,
And there was Ellis born and bred,
God bless him.
Of London City I am free,
And there I first my Wife did see,
And for that very cause, quoth he,
I love it.
And he that calls it Cuckowes nest,
Except he says he speaks in jest,
He is a villain and a beast,
I Will prove it.
This I Will maintain, nor do I care,
Though Captain Pot-gun stamp and stare,
And swagger, swear, and tear his hair
In fury.
And with the hazard of my blood,
I Will fight up to the knees in mud,
But I will make my quarrel good,
Assure ye.
For though I am a man of Trade,
And free of London City made,
Yet can I use Gun, Bill, and Blade
In battle.
And Citizens, if need require,
Themselves can force the Foe retire,
What ever this Low Country Squire
Do prattle.
For we have Soldiers of our own,
Able enough to guard the Town,
And Captains of most fair renown,
About it,
If any Foe should fight amain,
And set on us with all his Train,
We Will make him to retire again,
Nere doubt it.
We have fought well in dangers past,
And will do while our lives do last,
Without the help of any cast
Commaders
That hither come, compelled by want,
With rusty Swords, and Suits Provant,
From Vtrich, Numigen, or Gant,
In Flanders.
The Captain could no longer hold,
But looking fircely, plainly told
The Citizen, he was too bold,
and called him
Proud Boy, and for his saucy speech,
Did shortly vow to whip his breech:
Then Ellis snacht the pot, with which
he mall'd him.
He threw the jugge, and therewithal,
He gave the Captain such a mall, The Scuffle

As made him thump against the wall
his Crupper.
With that the Captain took a Dish
That stood brim-full of butterd Fish,
As good as any heart could wish
To supper.
And as he threw, his foot did slide,
Which turned his arm and dish aside,
And all be-Butter-fishifide
Nic Ballat.
And he, good man, did none disease,
But sitting quiet and at ease,
With butterd Rochets sought to please
His pallat.
But when he felt the wrong he had,
He raged, and swore, and grew stark mad,
Some in the room been better had
without him;
For he took hold of any thing,
And first he caught the poll of Ling,
Which he courageously did fling
about him.
Out of his hand it flew apace,
And hit the Lawyer in the face,
Who at the Board in highest place
was seated.
And as the Lawyer thought to rise,
The Salt was thrown into his eyes,
Which him of sight in woeful wise
Defeated.
All things nere hand, Nic Ballat threw:
At length his butterd Rochets flew:
And hit by chance, among the crew,
The Parson.
The Sauce his coat did all be-wet,
The Priest began to fume and fret,
The Seat was butterd which he set
His -- on.
He knew not what to do or say,
It was in vain to Preach or pray,
Or cry you are all gone astray,
Good people.
He might as well go strive to teach
Divinity beyond his reach
Or when the Bells ring out, go preach
In The Steeple.
At this mischance the silly man,
Out of the room would feign have ran,
And very angerly began
To mutter.
Ill luck had he, for after that
One threw the Parsneps full of fat
Which stuck like Brooches in his Hat,
with Butter.
Out of the place he soon repaires
And ran half headlong down the Stairs,
And made complaint to Master Airs
with crying.
Up ran he to know the matter,
And found how they the things did scatter,
Here a Trencher, there a platter
were lying.
I dare not say he stunk for woe,
Nor will, unless I did it know,
But some there be that dare say so,
that smelt him.
Nor could ye blame him, if he did,
For they threw dishes at his head,
And did with Eggs and Loaves of Bread,
bepelt him.
He thrust himself into the throng,
And u'sd the virtue of his tongue,
But what could one man's word among
so many?
The Candles all were shuffled out,
The Victuals flew afresh about;
Was never such a Combat fought
by any.
Now in the dark was all the coil,
Some were bloody in the broyle,
And some lay steept in Sallet-Oyle
and Mustard.
The sight would make a man afeard:
Another had a butterd Beard,
Another face was all besmeard
with Custard.
Others were daubed up to the knee
With butterd Fish and Furmitee;
And some the men could scarcely see
that beat'em.
Under the Board Lluellin lay, Will. Llu ellin a prisoner there, sometime the
Keeper.

Being sore frighted with the fray,
And as the weapons flew that way,
he eat'em.
The bread stuck in the windows all,
Like bullets in a Castle wall,
Which furious Foes do seek to scale
In battle.
Shoulders of Mutton, and Loins of Veale,
Appointed for to serve the Meal,
About their ears full many a Peale
Did rattle.
The which when Oven Blany spide, One of the under Keepers.

Oh, take away their Arms he cryde,
Lest some great hurt do them betide,
Prevent it,
And then the Knave away did steal,
Of food that fell, no little deal,
And in his house at many a meal
He spent it.
The Captain ran the rest among,
As eager to revenge the wrong
Done by the Pot which Ellis flung
So stoutly.
And angry Ellis sought about,
To find the furious Captain out,
At length they met, and then they fought
Devoutly.
Now being met, they never lin,
Till with their loud robustious din,
The room and all that was therein,
Did tumble.
Instead of Weapons made of steel,
The Captain took a salted Eele,
And at each blow made Ellis reele,
and tumble.
Ellis a Pippin pie had got,
A forer weapon than the pot:
For lo, the apples being hot,
did scald him.
The Captain laid about him still,
As if he would poor Ellis kill,
And with his Eele with a good will
he mall'd him.
At length, quoth he, Ellis thou art
A fellow of courageous heart,
Yield now, and I will take thy part
hereafter.
Quoth Ellis, much I scorn to hear
Thy words of threats, being free from fear.
With which he hardly could forbear
from laughter.
Together then afresh they fly,
The Eele against the Pippin Pie:
But Blany stood there purposely
to watch 'em
The weapons wherewithal they fought,
Were those, for which he chiefly sought,
And with an eager stomach thought
to catch' em.
But escaped not now so well away,
As at the Veale and Mutton fray:
He thought to have with such a prey
his jaws fed.
But all his hope did turn aside,
He looked for that which luck denied;
For Ellis all be-pippin-pyde
his Calves head
Woe was the case he now was in,
The Apples hot, did scald the skin,
His Skull, as it had rotten bin,
did coddle.
With that one fool among the rout,
Made outcry all the house about,
That Blany's brains were beaten out
his noddle
Which Lockwood hearing needs would see,
What all this coyl and stir might be, A Turnkey a fat fellow.

And up the Stairs his Guts and he
Went wadling.
But when he came the Chamber near,
Behind the door he stood to hear,
But in he durst not come for fear
Of swaddling.
There stood he in a frightfull case,
And as by chance he stirred his face,
Full in the mouth a buttered Playce
Did hit him.
Away he sneakt, and with his tongue,
He licked and swallowed up the wrong,
And as he went the room along
Be-him.
For help now does poor Lockwood cry,
O bring a Surgeon, or I die,
My guts out of my belly fly:
Come quickly.
Blany with open mouth likewise,
For present help of Surgeon cries,
Pity a man, quoth he, that lies
So sickly,
Philips, the skillful Surgeon then,
Was called, and called, and called again,
If he had skill to cure these men,
To show it.
At length he comes, and first he puts
His hands, to feel for Lockwoods guts,
Which came not forth so sweet as Nuts,
All know it.
He cries for water. In the mean
One calls up Madge the Kitchen queen,
To take and make the Baby clean,
And clout it.
Fast by the Nose she took the Squall,
And led him softly through the Hall,
Lest the perfume through knees should fall
About it.
She turned his Hose beneath the knee,
Nor could she choose but laugh to see,
That yellow, which was wont to be
A white breech.
She took a Dish-clout off the Shelfe,
And with it wipt the durtie Elfe,
Which had not wit to help it self
Poore-breech.
Thus leaving Lockwood all be-rai'd,
Unto the mercy of the Maid,
Who well deserved to be paid
For taking
Such homely pains, Now let us east,
Our thoughts back on the stir that is past,
And them whose bones could not in haste
Leave aching.
And like the Candles, shall my Pen
Show you these Gallants once again,
Which now like Furies, not like men
Appeared.
Fresh lights being brought to appease the bral,
Show twenty mad men in the Hall,
With Blood and Sauce their faces all
Besmeared.
Their Clothes rent and sows'd in drink,
Oil, Mustard, Butter, and the stink,
Which Lockwood lest, would make one think
In sadness,
That these so monstrous creatures dwell,
Either in Bedlam, or in Hell,
Or that no tongue, or Pen can tell
Their madness
They were indeed disfigured so,
Friend knew not friend nor foe-man foe,
And each man scarce himself did know:
But after
A frantic staring round about,
They suddenly did quit their doubt,
And loudly all at once brak out
In lafter.
The heat of all is now alaid,
The Keepers gently do persuade;
And (as before) all friends are made,
Full kindly.
Ellis, the Captain does embrace;
The Captain does return the grace,
And so do all men in the place,
As friendly
By Jove I love thee, Ellis cried;
The Captain soon as much replied,
Thou art, quoth he, a man well tried:
And Vulcan
With Mars at ods again shall be,
E're any iarres twixt thee and me:
And thereupon I drink to thee
A full Can.
And then he kneeld upon the ground.
Drink't off (quoth Ellis) for this round
For ever shall be held renownd:
And never
May any quarrel twixt us twain
Arise, or this renew again,
But may we loving friends remain
For ever
Amen, cryde Captain, so did all,
And so the health went through the Hall,
And thus the Noble Counter-brall
Was ended.
But hunger now did vexe'em more,
Then all their anger did before:
They searched in the room how far their store
Extended.
They want the meat which Blany stole,
One finds a Herring in a hole,
With dirt and dust black as a coal,
And trodden
All under feet; The next in post
Snaps up, and feeds on what was lost,
And looks not whether it be roast
Or sodden.
A third finds in another place
A piece of Ling in durtie case,
And Mustard in his fellows face;
Another
Espies, that finds a loaf of bread:
A dish of Butter all bespread.
And stuck upon another head
In The poother.
Thus what they found, contented some,
At length the Keeper brings a Broom,
Meaning there with to cleanse the room
With sweeping.
But under Table, on the ground,
Looking to sweep, by chance he found
Luellin, faining to be sound
-ly sleeping.
He pulled him out so swift by the heels,
As if his arse had ran on wheels,
And found his pockets stuffed with Eeles:
His Cod-piece
Did plenty of provision bring,
Somewhat it held of every thing,
Smelts, Flounders, Rochets, and of Ling
A broadpiece.
At this discovery each man round
Took equal share of what was found,
Which afterward they freely drowned
In good drink.
For of good Beer there was good store,
Till all were glad to give it over,
For each man had enough and more
That would drink.
And when they thus had Drunk and fed,
(As if no quarrel had been bred)
They all shook hands and all to bed
Did shuffle.
Ellis, the glory of this Town,
With that brave Captain of renown,
And thus I end this famous Coun
-ter Scuffle.
FINIS.


To the Reader.
THis Bacchanalian Night-prize of the Counter-Scuffle, being thus finished,
has ever since frighted hoth Prisoners and Iaylors from coming into any
room, for fear of a second uproare. So that the Counter, for want of sweet
garnishing, and cleanly looking to, is grown so nasty, that no man (by his good
will) will thrust his nose in at any of the grates: Nay, will rather go a mile
about, than come near it; Though to keep it sweet, a great deal of Mace is
stuck upon every Sergeant, as if he were a Copon in white-broth.

Upon this slovenlinesse, it is woefully haunted with Rats, not such Rats as
run up and down in Brew-bouses, sucking the new wort of strong Beer so
long, and in such abundance, that half the City is compelled to drink Beer as
small as water; Nor those Rats which are not mealy mouthed in Bake-houses,
where they gnaw so many batches of Bread, that a Penny loaf wants sometimes
three or four ounces in weight: And then the honest Baker is blamed, and
cursed, and (perhaps) innocently set in the Pillory.

Neither are they those Rats, which greaze their throats in Tallow-Chandlers
shops, where they nibble so much upon Candles, that not one pound in an hundred
is ever full weight.

No, these are no Rats with four legs, but only two; and though they have
nests in a thousand places of London, yet for the most part they run but into
two Rot-traps, that is to say, The Counters of Wood-street and the Poultry, and
for that cause are called Counter-Rats.

How caught, how mouz'd, and what they are,
This picture lively does declare.
THE COVNTER RAT.
OF Knights and Squires of low degree,
Of Roaring Boys, that stick and snee,
Of Battoon Dam-mees, that cry Bree,
I sing now,
At men and women, (Bawds and whores)
At Pimps and Panders that keep doors, I mean no Play-doores: Those are too
honest.

At all that outface Vintners scores,
I fling now.
What fling I? Nothing, but light rimes,
(Not tuned as are St. Pulchers chimes)
No steeples height my Muse now climbes,
But flies.
Close to the ground as Swallows do,
When rainy weather must ensue,
She flies, and sings, and if not true,
She lies.
Lay ( The Kings Iuggler.
Hocus Pocus) thy tricks by,
Let Martin Parkers Ballads die,
Thy theaming likewise I defy;
O Fenner.
Let Hogsdon-Scrapers on their Base
Sound Fum-fum-fum from totterd case,
Nor Mean, nor Treble now take place,
But Tennor;
A Counter-Tennor is that note,
Too easy, -- it is nere sung by rote,
But got with wetting well your throat
With Claret.
Or stout March-beere, or Windsor Ale,
Or Labor in vain, (so seldom stale,)
Or Pymlico, whose too great sale
Did mar it:
He that me reads, shall fall out flat
With Homers Frog, and Virgils Gnat,
And Ovids Flea, which so near sat
The Moon shine.
For I of stranger wonders write,
Of a wild Vermin got each night,
Mad Bulls in the dark, but guls in sight,
Of Sunshine.
My Metamorphosis is rare,
For Men to Rats transformed are,
And then, those Rats are Prisoners fare,
O pity!
But it is good sport to see them dressed,
To garnish out a Mornings Feast,
Each bit being salted with a jest
Scarce witty:
These are not Rats that nibble cheese,
Or challenge moldy crusts for fees,
And rather will their long tails leese
Than Bacon:
No, these are they, whose guts being crammed,
(As Canons hard with powder ram'd)
And Bag-pipe cheeks with wines inflamed,
Are taken
By Constables and Bill-men eke,
Who speak not Latin, French, nor Greek,
But are Night-Sconces out to seek
Night-sneakers,
Who late in Taverns up do sit,
Whiffing smoke, Money, Time, and wit.
Pouring in Boules, till out they spit Full Beakers.
These (then) being to the Counter led.
Each Prisoner shakes his shaggie head,
And leaning half out of his bed,
A laughing
Falls, -- And cries out -- A Rat -- A Rat,
Oh! roares another, -- Is he fat?
If not, -- Fley off his cloak or hat;
Thus scoffing,
Till Morn they lie. -- The poor Rat gets
Into some hole. -- Besides his wits,
To hear such cater walling fits,
So fright him:
But day being rise, -- All up do rise,
And call for Beer to clear his eyes,
A Garnish then the whole Room cries,
They bite him,
Ask any how such news I tell,
Of Wood-streets hole or Poultries hell?
Know, I did' among those Gypsies dwell,
That cozen there.
I mean the Turn keys, and those Knaves,
Who rack, for fees, men worse then slaves,
I saw brought in with bills and glaves,
Some dozen there.
For I one night by Rug-gownes caught,
Was for a Rat to the Counter brought,
What there my dear experience bought,
I Will sell ye
Cheaper, than I could have it there,
For they for Tokens throats will tear,
But such as it is, fill with the Cheer
Your belly.
Prick up your ears, -- for I begin
To tell, what Rats, my night, came in,
Caught without Cat, or Trap, or Ginne,
But mildly,
Being called before the Bench of wits
Who sit out midnights Bedlam fits;
But some being rid, like Iades with Bits,
Ran wildly.
First, about twelve, the Counter gates
Thundered with thumpings, -- Doors and grates
Reeled at the peale, -- when our prison-mates
Up starting,
Saw in the yard a frantic Swarm,
Crying, O my head, neck, sides, leg, arm,
Sore had the fight been, but small harm
At parting,
It was a watch, swearing we bleed,
But 'twas their noses dropped indeed;
Masters (quoth they) we charge ye take heed
Of him there.
A Roaring Rat.
THat Royster, us to our trumps has put,
And run our Beadle through a gut,
His Bilbo has from each man cut
A limb here.
They gone, Up comes the Bredah-Bouncer,
His tusks stiffe-starcht like a brave Mounser,
Of Turnbull-Puncks a staring Trouncer,
Some knew him;
Why, here (quoth we) why? zounds because
I tugged with bears, and pared their paws,
But sure I mall'd Mr Constables Jaws,
O slew him;
All Is one, -- said one, Please you to bed Sir;
He (swearing) roared, I Am better bred Sir,
I scorn to rock my Harnesse-Head Sir,
In feathers;
Give me a Brick, Sir, for my bolster,
An Armourer still is my Vpholster,
In frost, snow, muck-hils I can roll Sir,
Hang weathers.
Rogue, fetch me a sweet trusse of straw,
To fire thy Iayle, -- Pox a this Law,
That coopes a Soldier like sack Daw,
Is It treason?
Rascal! more Claret, There Is none here Sir,
Why then (you mangy Cur) some beer Sir,
There Is not a Tapster dares come near Sir*
Thy reason?
Because you thwack out such huge words Sir,
His wezand fears them worse than swords Sir
Mum then, -- I Will take a nap o'th boords Sir.
He sleeps there.
A Cross legged Rat.
A Puritan Tailor then came in,
Who (to take measure) out had bin,
And (Maudlin-drunk) to rince his sin,
He weeps there.
Weeps to be called a Rat, being known
A man at least, -- so down being thrown,
On a hard Bench, thus did he groan
In sorrow;
Brethren where am I? One replied,
In Wood-street Counter. -- O my pride!
Thou art taken down, and I must hide
Too morrow
A head that was not hid before,
Woe worth him makes Manasses roar,
But die I may not in his score,
Believe me,
For consolation I espy
The Row my sweet Spanish needles eye,
The Sisters will (if here I lie)
Releeve me,
Sisters in the Counter! oh no: here
Only the wicked ones appear,
Wash then thy shame in brinish tears,
Confessing.
Thou Art rightly punished for thy Yard,
And for thy Goose which grazed too hard,
And for some Stuffes which thou have marred
With pressing.
We asked him, why he was brought in,
Black threads of vice (quoth he) I spin,
And then again did thus begin,
Condoling,
All are not Friars, I see, wear Cowles,
Nor all in minced ruffes, milk-white souls,
I should have talked thus when the bowls
Were trolling:
But then, to steal I held no harm,
Lappets of drink to keep me warm,
But linings wet, hurt, though they arm,
Indeed-la
O would my sheeres might cut my thread,
Why is this crosse-legg'd mischief bred?
Mending my want from heel to head
With speed-la.
Sorrow has made me dry, -- No matter,
Out of mine eyes will I drink water,
No other Ram my brains shall batter,
To kill me,
Roof, touch no more wines, French or Spanish,
All drinks Papisticall I banish,
Out of my lips this phrase shall vanish
Boy, -- Fill me.
One bid him call for beer, -- he sed,
Oh! No more beer. -- But reach me bread,
By that lle swear -- Would I were dead,
And rotten.
When I again swill ought but whay,
Yet lest (being cold) my zeal decay,
Hot waters shall not be one day
Forgotten.
An old gray Rat.
THis done, he nods, and quickly snores;
And then afresh wind fly the doors,
An Usurer hedged in with mad Whores,
Came wallowing,
As does a great ship on the Seas,
Set on by Galleys, -- for, all these
Were Fish-wives, who had wine at ease
Been swallowing,
And blown him up with penny-pots
Of Sack, which fall to him by lots,
Paid him at weeks end by the old Trots,
For shillings
Each Monday lent them, -- To buy Skate
Crabs, Plaice, and Sprats at Bill insgate
Thus, then they met, and hold thus late
Their drillings.
He rests in peace, -- but is not dead,
Yet is worms meat in lowzie bed,
And lies like one wrapped up in led,
None stirred him,
But all his Oyster-mouthes gaped wide,
(Wine in their guts was at full Tide)
The Devil did so their Rumps bestride,
And spurred them:
They flung and winc'd, and kicked down stairs
Themselves, and stamped like Flanders Mares,
Hell is broke loose, No Keeper dares
Approach them;
For, at that Dog (besawc'd in Sack)
They grind their teeth, and curse him black,
Crying out, It Is thee does break their back,
And broach them
So fast, that all their gains boil out,
Deep-red to dye his pockie snout,
But, that which flung these brands about
So hotly,
'Gan now to quench them, sleep does sound
Retreat, dead-drunk they all lie drowned
In cast-up wine, -- and on the ground
The shot lie.
A Black Rat.
SCarce was this hellish dinne allayd,
But drencht in mire, with drink berayd,
(New curried) was brought in a jade
All mettle,
An Estridge that iron bars could eat,
And Strong-beere out of Sea-coales beat,
His fifty-cuffes did the Watch fret
And nettle;
This second Smug, who had the staggers,
This Vulcanist, whose nails were daggers,
This Smith so armed in Ale, he swaggers,
At snoring,
Though locked up, yet set up his trade,
Bolts, Hinges, Bars, and Grates he made
Fly, -- which being heard, the Iaylors paid
His roaring.
They furnished him with iron enough.
Neck, hands, and legs had armor tough,
And stronger (but more cold) than Buffe,
To guard him.
How did they this? none durst come near him
Like Tom of Bedlam did they fear,
All bringing Cans, to pledge them, swear him,
So snared him,
Yet, for all this, he danced in's shackles,
And cried, the other Pot, I want more tackles,
And thus (till break of day) it cackles,
Laid having
The addle Egg of his turned brains,
In his iron nest of rusty chains,
Which made him lose both sense of pains,
And raving.
A Long Tayl'd Rat.
THe next that in our little Ease,
Came to be bit with Lice and Fleas,
Was a spruce Knave, like none of these,
But sober,
As the Strand May Pole, -- he did go,
In ruff, -- His thumb the row ring did show
A Gentleman sealed, -- for he was no
Hog-grubber:
It was a Petty-fogging Varlet,
Whose back wore freez, but bum no scarlet,
And was taken napping with his Harlot,
At noddy:
But being haled in, his hair he rent;
And swore they all should dear repent
Their baseness, -- for no ill he meant
To her body:
The Prisoners ask't then what she was,
(Quoth he) My Client, -- One well to pass,
Though here they impound me like an Ass,
I Will ferk them.
I Will make the Beadle pluck in's horn,
He flirted at my nose in scorn,
The Watch shall stink, the Constable mourn,
I Will jerk them,
Hang them (if need be) for they broke
Her house, -- That Is Burglary, -- The clock
Scarce counting two, -- Then they struck
Ath'mazzard.
An action of strong Battery! Good!
They made my Nose then gush blood;
(One more!) -- And that I mist the mud
was hazard.
Here Is Law in lumps: -- Must, when to trial
My Client comes, I have denial
For ingress to her, by Scabs? A Ryal
I enter
At Midnight, -- a plain Case, -- else Ployden
The Case is altered: -- shall each Hoyden
Bar Law her course? Dare rustic Royden
so venture?
A farthing-candle burning by,
By chance his railing rage did die,
Yet to his Breast, Revenge did cry:
so churning
His brains for Law-tricks how to sting them,
And up to all the Bars to bring them,
He sat, hard-twisting cords to wring them,
till morning.
No more of this light skipping Verse;
A dreery Table I now rehearse.
LOng this brown study did not last,
But in, at Compter-gates as fast
Thronged in the Watch again. A noise
Of scraping men and squeaking boys
Straight filled the house. The Two-pennyward
Leaped up and fell a dancing hard:
Out at the Hole, all thrust their heads;
The Knights Ward left their seven-groatbeds:
The Masters side hearing the din
Swore that the Devil was sure brought in:
But when they heard they Fiddlers were;
Some cursed the noise, some lent an ear:
None cursed, but what went drunk to bed,
Being then for want of drink half dead.
Locked were the Fiddlers in a Room;
All cried, Strike up, Play Rogues, Fum fum.
The Minnikin tickled, roar did the Base;
Then bawdy songs, all sleep must chase;
The men played heavily, boys did whine,
Not seeing Meat, Money, Beer, nor Wine:
Up such a laugh the Prisoners took,
That the Beds danced, and Chambers shook;
Nay, the strange hubbub did so please,
At Prison-bace ran both Lice and Fleas.
The Rozzen rubbed off, the Cats guts weary,
We asked, how they who made men merry
Grew sad themselves, and why (like sprites)
Fiddlers being strung to walk anights,
Were they locked up? -- One then, i th eye
Putting his finger, told us why.
Quoth he, being met by a mad Crew,
In these poor cases -- up they drew
Our Fiddles, and like Tinkers swore
We should play them to the Blue-Bore,
Kept by mad Ralf at Islington,
Whose Hum and Mum, being power'd upon
Our guts, -- so burnt'em, we desired
To part; -- being out of the house even fired:
As our hands played, our heads were plied;
And, tho the night was cold, we fried;
For such hot waters sod our brain,
Like Daws in June, we gaped for rain:
Strong were our Coxcombs, our legs weak;
We, nor our Fiddles had wit to speak.
The company then being fast asleep,
And we paid soundly, out did creep
Into the highway -- O sweet Moon!
We, but for thee, had been undone:
Yet, though thy torch to us was sighted,
We all might well have been indicted
For breaking into others ground,
Three in one ditch being almost drowned;
Yet out scrambled, and along
The Playhouse came, -- where seeing no throng,
We swore 'twas sure some scurvy Play,
That all the people so sneaked away;
And so the Players descended were
To the Star, Nags-head, or Christopher.
To all those Taverns (we cried) Let Us go,
At which one fell, and then swore -- No.
The Bars in Smith-field well we past,
For all the Watch had run in haste,
Armed with chalked Bills, waked by a cry
Of Whore-dorps taken by the enemy.
From Cow-Cross stood those stoves not far,
In which were entered men of war;
(Low Country Soldiers late come over)
Each one going in to press a whore.
Leaving them pressing, on we trot
Through the Horse-fair, till we had got
Into the middle of Long-lane,
Where up the Devil does Brokers train.
There down we fell, and then fell out,
Our leathern Cases flew about:
We fenced, and foyn'd, and fought so long,
That all our Fiddles lay half unstrung;
Their backs were broke, and we o'th'ground,
Swouning for grief they did not sound:
Our noise brought up from Aldersgate
The rugged Watch, who before sat
Nodding at the old Mermaids door;
Who with a guard of half a score
Seized us, and cried, at going away,
Sad Lachrymae you there shall play.
This told, the Prisoners laughed outright;
And though the whole Ward had no light,
Yet from their beds all skipt and cry,
Scrapers, strike up, we the VVatch desie.
The Moon so bold was to look in,
And saw some only in their skin,
(Naked as Cuckowes when June's past)
Some had long shirts down to their waste;
Some wanted back-parts, some an Arm;
None wore a shirt could keep him vvarm:
A French Boy that svveeps Chimnies, vvears
His patch'd-up frock as white as theirs:
Some on their heads no night-caps wore,
Some lapp'd their brows in hose all tore:
They hobble about, they frisk, they sing
So long, that cracked was every string,
By their rude horse-play altogether,
Flinging their legs they cared not whither.
Such horrid noise, such stinking smell
Cannot be heard nor felt in hell:
Yet over they gave not, till the Sun
Arose, then all to bed did run.
Good Morrow.
THe Rats into the Trap that fell
That night, were few -- The Constable
Belike did wink, and would not see;
For, when the winds rise, his watch and he
Toss all that venture on their waves;
The rocks being brown-bills, Clubs and staves
On which they split them -- These and they
When morning comes are fetched away:
Those Rats over night whose shapes did leese,
Being soon turned men, by paying but fees;
Yet some lose tail, some are seratcht bare,
Whilst Constables and Counters share.
FINIS.
