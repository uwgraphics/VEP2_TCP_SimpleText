THE PREFACE
1. I had thought to have given somewhat a larger account in this Preface, then
now I do: as well concerning the publishing of these Sermons [1. Why at all?
2. Why now? so late? 3. Why these? so many? so few?] as concerning the Sermons
themselves [1. The Truth, and 2. The Choice of the Matters therein handled. 3.
The Manner of handling,] and such other things, as some Readers out of
curiosity expect to be satisfied in. But considering with my self, that there
may be times, wherein it may be a point of the greatest Amos. 5.13.
prudence to keep silence; and wherein, as it was wisely said of old, Qui been
latuit, been vixit, He lives best that appears least; so it may be as truly
said, Qui been tacuit, been dixit, He speaks best that says least: I thought
it safer to save that labor, then to adventure the possibility of having
offense taken, upon no better security then the not having meant to give any.

2. Therefore in short; thus. After these Sermons were preached, so far was I
from any forwardness to publish them, that for some years they were thrown
aside without any thought of printing them, but rather a resolution to the
contrary. I could not observe any such scarcity of printed Sermons abroad, as
that there should be any great need of sending out more: and the copying out of
most of them again (which was to be done, ere the work could be fitted for the
Press, and could not well be done by any other hand then my own) could not be
any such pleasing task to me (especially at these years, 69. current) as to
tempt me to a willingness to undergo a drudgery of so much toil and
irkesomeness. Wherefore, though I was often and earnestly solicited thereunto,
both by the entreaties and letters of friends, and some considerable offers
also from such as trade in Books, to quicken me on: yet my consent came on very
heavily, and my resolutions remained uncertain. Until I understood that one,
who having by some means or other light on a Copy of one single Sermon of mine,
preached at Newport in the Isle of Wight during the treaty there, upon Gal.
5.22. had Vide Epistolam meam divulgatam -- Hocne oportuit me inconsulio? Lips.
Cent. 2. Epist. 100.
surreptitiously without my consent, or so much as knowledge (and that -- Et an
sic oportuit? solam? imo and corruptam? Ibid.
negligently and imperfectly enough) printed it. Which, not knowing how to
help for what was past, nor for the future how far it might become a leading
example for others to follow, (as Exempli improbi res est: nec pro^us aliquis
neget. Ibid. -- Mali exempli est, arbitrium hoc sibi sumere in scripta aliena.
Id. ad lector. praefix 2. Centur. Miscell.
ill Precedents seldom want seconds;) but well knowing withal, that there
were in several men's hands, Copies also of most of the Sermons here printed: I
had no other way left to secure the rest from running the same Fate their
fellow had done, then by yielding my absolute consent to the publishing of
them, and preparing them (as my leisure would serve) for the Press. For I had
learned by this late, and some former experiences, that there are men, of those
that -- nam quae reverentia legum, Quis pudor, aut metus est unquam,
properantis avari? Juven. Sat. 14.
make have to be rich, who bear so little reverence to the Laws of common
Equity and Ingenuity, that they will transgress them all, for the gain of
(...). Aristoph. in Plut.
three-half-pence, or a piece of bread.

3. But when thus resolved, I came to seek up my scattered Copies, which lay
neglected (so little did I value them) some in one corner, some in another: of
the Two and Twenty, which I intended to publish (viz. Nineteen Ad Aulam,
preached at the Court in my Attendance, Ordinary and Occasional there; and
Three Ad Magistratum, preached before some of the Reverend Judges in their
Circuits:) after the best search I could make, I fell short Five of my whole
number: Those Ad Magistratum were all found; and being all now published, there
need no farther account to be given of them. The Nineteen Ad Aulam were these,
viz. Prove. 28.1.
I. on Eccl. VII.1. Whitehall. 1631. II. on Prove. XVI.7. Whitehall. 1632. III.
on 1 Pet. II.17. Newarke. 1633. IV. 1 on Luke XVI.8. Otelands. 1636. V. on
Psalm. XIX.13. Belvoyr. VI. 1 on Phil. IV.11. Greenwich. 1637. VII. 2 on Phil.
IV.11. Otelands. VIII.z on Esaias LII.3. Greenwich. 1638. IX. on Romans XV.5.
Theobalds. X. on Psalm. XXXVII.11. Berwicke. 1639. XI. on 1 Timothy III.16.
Berwicke. XII. 1 on 1 Cor. X.23. Whitehall. 1640. XIII. on Psalm. CXIX.75.
Whitehall. XIV. 2 on 1 Cor. X.23. Hampton. XV. on Romans XV.6. Whitehall. 1641.
XVI. on Psalm. XXVII.10. Woburne. 1647. XVII. 2 on Luke XVI.8. Stoke Pogeys.
XVIII. on Gal. V.22. Newport. 1648. XIX. on Heb. XII.3. Newport. Of these the
I.II.III.IV. and X. were all missing; and the XVIII. was before fallen into the
hands of another; who would not be persuaded to part with his Copy, as he
calls it, either to me upon entreaty, (perhaps to chastise me for my
Ignorance, who was so silly before as to think I had had some right to my own;)
or to his fellow-Stationer upon any reasonable (or rather as I am informed,
unreasonable) terms: which is done, though not all out so agreeable to the old
Rule, Quod tibi fieri non vis, yet very conformly to the old Proverb, (...). --

4. Of these Six, thus in hazard to be all left out in the impression; Three
are recovered, and here presented to public view, and Three are not. The
First, viz. that on Eccles. VII.1.) I made a shift by the help of my memory, to
make up (as near, as it would serve me, to what I had so long since spoken) out
of an old Copy of a Sermon formerly preached upon the same Text elsewhere. For
I am not ashamed to profess that most of those Ad Aulam were framed upon such
Texts, and out of such Materials, as I had formerly made use of in other
places: but always cast (as it were) into new moulds. For both, fit it was the
difference of the Auditories in the one place, and in the other should be
somewhat considered: and besides my first crude meditations being always
hastily put together, could never please me so well at refrigerato inventionis
amore. Quintil. Epist. ad Tryph.
a second and more leisurable review, as to pass without some additions,
defalcations, and other alterations, more or less. The Second and Third also
(viz. that on Prove. XVI.7. and that on 1 Pet. II.17.) it was my good hap,
searching purposely among the Papers of my late worthy friend and neighbor
(whose memory must ever be precious with me,) Thomas Harrington Esquire deceased,
there to find, together with the Copies of diverse others which I wanted not,
transcribed with his own hand. But the Fourth and Fifth are here still wanting,
because I could not find them out: and so is the Eighteenth also, because I
could not get it in. The want of which last, though happening not through my
default, yet I have made a kind of compensation for, by adding one other
Sermon of those Ad Populum, in lieu of that which is so wanting, to make up the
number an even Score notwithstanding. The Reader shall find it in the later
end of the Book, carrying on every leaf (by a mistake in the printing) the
title of The First Sermon: which he may please to mend, either with a dash of
his pen, by putting out the whole 3. words [ The First Sermon,] seeing there
are no more to follow it; or else (with reference to the Seven Sermons Ad
Populum formerly published, by writing [ Eighth] instead of [ First] all along
in the Title.

5. As for the Sermons themselves, the matter therein contained, the manner of
handling, etc. I must permit all to the Readers doom. Who if he be homo
quadratus, perfectly even, and unbyassed both in his Judgment, and Affection,
(that is to say, neither prepossessed with some false Principle to forestall
the one; nor carried aside with partiality for, or prejudice against, any
person or party, to corrupt the other) will be the better able to discern,
whether I have any where in these Papers exceeded the bounds of Truth and
Soberness, or laid my self open to the just imputation either of Flattery or
Falsehood. There has been a generation of men ( wise (...) and for their own
purposes, Luke 16.8.
but Malignants sure enough) that labored very much when time was, to possess
the world with an opinion, that all Court-Chaplains were Parasites, and their
preaching little other then daubing. I hope these Papers will appear so
innocent in that behalf, as to contribute somewhat toward the shame and
confutation of that Slander.

6. The greater fear is, that (as the times are) all men will not be well
pleased with some passages herein, especially where I had occasion to speak
something of our Church-Ceremonies; then under command, but since grown into
disuse. But neither ought the displeasure of men, nor the change of times, to
cast any prejudice upon the Truth: which in all variations and turnings of
affairs remains the same it was from the beginning; and has been accustomed,
and therefore can think it no new thing, to find unkind entertainment abroad,
especially from them whose interest it is to be (or at leastwise to seem to be)
of a different persuasion. For, that the Truth is rather on my side in this
point then on theirs that dissent from me, there is (besides other) this strong
presumption onwards; That I continue of the same judgment I was of, twenty,
thirty, forty years ago; and profess so to do, with no great hopes of
bettering my temporal condition by so professing: whereas hundreds of those,
who now decry the Ceremonies (as they do also some other things of greater
importance) as Popish and Antichristian, did (not many years since) both use
them themselves, and by their subscriptions approve the enjoining of them; but
having since in compliance with the times professed their dislike of them,
their portion is visibly grown fatter thereby. If the face of affairs be not
now the same it was, when the Sermons wherein this point is most insisted on
were preached; what was then done, is not sure in any justice now chargable
upon me as a crime: who never pretended to be a Prophet; nor could then either
foresee that the times would so soon have changed, or have believed that so
(...). Naz.
many men would so soon have changed with the times.

7. Of the presumption aforesaid I have here made use; not that the business
stands in need of such a Reserve, for want of competent proof otherwise,
which is the case wherein Vbi deficit plena probatio, praesumptionibus agendum
est.
the Lawyers chiefly allow it: but to save the labor of doing that over again
in the Preface, which I conceive to be already done in the Work it self. With
what success I know not: that lies in the breast of the Reader. But that I
speak no otherwise then I thought, and what my intentions were therein; that
lies in my own breast, and cannot be known to the Reader. Who is therefore in
charity bound to believe the best, where there appears no pregnant
probability to the contrary. The discourses themselves for much of the matter
directly tend to the peace both of Church and State, by endeavoring to
persuade to Unity and Obedience: and for the manner of handling, have much in
them of Plainness, little (I think nothing at all) of Bitterness, and so are of
a temper fitter to instruct, then to provoke. And these I am sure are no
Symptoms of very bad Intentions. If there be no worse Construction made of
them then I meant, nor worse Use: I trust they neither will deserve much blame,
nor can do much hurt. Howsoever, having now adventured them abroad, though
having little else to commend them but Truth and Perspicuity, two things which
I have always had in my care (for whereto else serves that (...) wherewith
God has endued man, but to speak reason and to be understood?) if by the good
blessing of Almighty God, whom I desire to serve in the spirit of my mind,
they may become (in any little degree) instrumental to his Glory, the
Edification of his Church, and the promoting of any one soul in Faith and
Holiness toward the attainment of everlasting salvation: I shall have great
cause of rejoicing in it, as a singular evidence of his undeserved mercy
toward me, and an incomparably rich reward of so poor and unworthy labors.
Yet dare I not promise to my self any great hopes, that any thing that can be
spoken in an argument of this nature, though with never so much strength of
reason and evidence of truth, should work any kindly effect upon the men of
this generation; when the times are nothing favorable, and themselves
altogether undisposed to receive it: No more then the choicest Music can
affect the ear that is stopped up; or the most proper Physic operate upon him,
that either cannot or will not take it. But as the Sun when it shines clearest
in a bright day, if the beams thereof be intercepted by a beam (too but of
another kind,) lying upon the eye, is to the party so blinded as if the light
were not at all: so I fear it is in this case. Not through any incapacity in
the Organ so much, especially in the learneder part among them; as from the
interposition of an unsound Principle, which they have received with so much
affection, that for the great complacency they have in it, they are loath to
have it removed. And as they of the Roman party, having once thoroughly imbibed
this grand Principle, that the Catholic Church (and that must needs be it of
Rome) is infallible, are thereby rendered incapable to receive any impressions
from the most regular and concluding discourses that can be tendered to them,
if they discern any thing therein disagreeing from the dictates of Rome; and so
are perpetually shut up into a necessity of erring, if that Church can err,
unless they can be wrought off from the belief of that Principle: which is not
very easily to be done, after they have once swallowed it, and digested it,
without the great mercy of God, and a huge measure of self-denial: Even so have
these our Anti-cer^monian Brethren framed to themselves a false Principle
likewise, which holds them in Error, and hardens them against all
impressions or but Offers of Reason to the contrary.

8. All Errors, Sects, and Heresies, as they are mixed with some inferior
Truths, to make them the more passable to others; so do they usually owe their
original to some eminent Truths (either misunderstood, or mis-applied,) whereby
they become the less discernable to their own Teachers: whence it is that such
Teachers 2 Timothy 3.13
both deceive, and are deceived. To apply this then to the business in hand.
There is a most sound and eminent Truth, justly maintained in our own and other
Reformed Churches, concerning the Perfection and Sufficiency of the holy
Scriptures: which is to be understood of the revelation of supernatural truths,
and the substantials of Gods worship, and the advancing of moral and civil
duties to a more sublime and spiritual height by directing them to a more noble
end, and exacting performance of them in a holy manner; but without any purpose
thereby to exclude the belief of what is otherwise reasonable, or the practice
of what is prudential. This Orthodox Truth has by an unhappy misunderstanding
proved that great stone of offense, whereat all our late Sectaries have
stumbled. Upon this foundation (as they had laid it) began our
Anti-ceremonians first to raise their so often-renewed Models of Reformation:
but they had first trans-formed it into quite another thing; by them perhaps
mistaken for the same, but really as distant from it, as Falsehood from Truth;
to wit this, That nothing might lawfully be done or used in the Churches of
Christ, unless there were either Command or Example for it in the Scriptures:
Whence they inferred, that whatsoever had been otherwise done or used was to be
cast out as Popish, Antichristian, and Superstitions. This is that unsound
corrupt Principle whereof I spoke: that root of bitterness, whose stem in
process of time has brought forth all these numerous branches of Sects and
Heresies, wherewith this sinful Nation is now so much pestered.

9. It is not my purpose, nor is this a place for it, to make any large
discovery of the cause of the mistake, the unsoundness of the Tenent it self,
and how pernicious it is in the Consequents. Yet I cannot but humbly and
earnestly entreat them, for the love of God, and the comfort of their own
souls; as they tender the peace of the Church, and the honor of our Religion;
and in compassion to thousands of their Christian brethren, who are otherwise
in great danger to be either misled or scandalized: that they would think it
possible for themselves to be mistaken in their Principle, as well as others,
and possible also for those Principles they rest upon to have some frailties
and infirmities in them, though not hitherto by them adverted, because never
suspected; That therefore they would not hasten to their Conclusion, before
they are well assured of the Premises, nor so freely bestow the name of Popish
and Superstitious upon the opinions or actions of their Brethren, as they have
used to do, before they have first and thoroughly examined the solidity of their
own grounds: finally, and in order thereunto, That they would not therefore
despise the offer of these few things ensuing to their consideration, because
tendered by one that stands better affected to their Persons then Opinions.

10. And first I beseech them to consider, how unluckily they have at once both
straightened too much, and yet too much widened that, which they would have to be
the adequate Rule of warrantable actions; by leaving out Prudence, and taking
in Example. Nor does it sound well, that the Examples of Men, though never so
godly, should, as to the effect of warranting our actions, stand in so near
equipage with the commands of God, as they are here placed jointly together
without any character of difference so much as in degree. But the superadding
of Examples to Commands in such manner as in this Assertion is done, either
signifies nothing, or overthrows all the rest: which is so evident, that I
wonder how it could escape their own observation. For that Example which is by
them supposed sufficient for our warranty, was it self either warranted by some
command or former Example, or it was not. If it were; then the adding of it,
clearly signifies nothing: for then that warrant we have by it, proceeds not
from it, but from that which warranted it. If it were not; then was it done
merely upon the dictates of Prudence and Reason: and then if we be sufficiently
warranted by that Example (as is still by them supposed) to act after it, we
are also sufficiently thereby warranted to act upon the mere dictates of
Prudence and Reason, without the necessity of any other either Command or
Example for so doing. What is the proper use that ought to be made of Examples
is touched upon a little in the Eighth Sermon Ad Aulam, toward the later end;
but is very needful to be better understood then it is, considering the ill use
that has been made of Scripture Examples both in former, and (much more) in
these our later times.

11. Secondly, I beseech them to consider, (whereof also I have given some
touch more then once in the ensuing Sermons) what scandal is given, and what
advantage to the Anabaptists, Familists, Quakers, and the whole crew of our
modern Sectaries, by what other name or title soever they are called or
distinguished. When this gap was once opened [ What command have you in
Scripture, or what Example for this or that?] Una Eurusque Notusque: it was
like the opening of Pandora's Box, or the Trojane Horse. As if all had been let
loose; swarms of Sectaries of all sorts broke in, and (as the Frogs and Locusts
in Egypt) overspread the face of the Land. Not so only, but (as often it
happens) these young Striplings soon outstript their Leaders, and that upon
their own ground: leaving those many Parasangs behind them, who had first
showed them the way, and made entrance for them. For as those said to others;
What Command or Example have you for kneeling at the Communion? for wearing a
Surplice, etc? for Lord Bishops? for a penned Liturgy? for keeping Holy Days?
etc. and there stopped: So these to them; Where are your Lay-Presbyters, your
Classis, etc. to be found in Scripture? Where your Steeple Houses? your
National Church? your Tithes and Mortuaries? your Infant-sprinklings? Nay,
where your Meeter-Psalms? your two Sacraments? your observing a weekly Sabbath?
(for so far I find they are gone, and how much farther, I know not, already:
and how much farther they will hereafter, for Erranti nullus terminus, God only
knows,) show us, say they, a Command or Example for them in Scripture.
Juvenal. Sat. 2
Fugeunt trepidi vera and manifesta loquentem
Stoicidae --
Thus do these pay them home in their own metal: and how the pay can be
honestly refused, till they order their Mintage better, I yet understand not.
If any of them shall say, with him in the Satyrist Id. Sat. 14.
-- haec ego nunquam
Mandavi dices olim, nec talia suasi.
the reply is ready in the next verse there Mentis causa malae tamen est, and
origo, penes te. I doubt not but many of those that made a stand sooner, are
highly displeased with those that rusht on headlong and adventured farther; yea
and it may be, declame against them with some vehemence both in the Pulpit and
Press. But truly no great reason, if they lent them their premises, to fall out
with them about the Conclusion: The Master in the Fable did not well to beat
his Maid for serving him with thin Milk, when it was his own Cow that gave it.
For why should he that gives another Scandal, be angry with him for taking it?
or he that helps to set it on tumbling down the hill, blame the stone if it
tumble on still Ex virtute impressa, and do not stop just where he would have
it? So mischievous a thing is it, as Aristotle often observes, Arist. 3. de
coelo 7. See also 1. de coelo 5. de incessu animal. cap. 7. de generat. animal.
cap. 7
(...): not to lay the foundation upon a firm bottom at the first. It had been
best, if this had been looked to sooner and from the beginning: but better then
not at all, if it would be well considered yet, and some remedy thought on to
help it as much as may be, before it grow past all hope of recovery.

11. But thirdly and above all I beseech them to consider, whither that (...),
which many times marreth a good business, has carried them; and how mightily
(though unwittingly, and I verily believe most of them unwillingly) they
promote the interest of Rome, whilst they do with very great violence (but not
with equal prudence) oppose against it: so verifying that of the
Historian-Poet, spoken in another csae Lucan.
-- Omnia dat qui justa negat. I mean, in casting out not Ceremonies only, but
Episcopacy also, and Liturgy, and Festivals out of the Church, as Popish and
Antichristian. -- Hoc Ithacus velit. If any of these things be otherwise
guilty, and deserve such a relegation upon any other account (which yet is more
then I know) farewell they: But to be sent away packing barely upon this score
that they are Popish and Antichristian; this brings in such a plentiful
harvest of Proselytes to the Jesuit, that he does not now as formerly gaudere
intus and in sinu (laugh in his sleeve, as we say) but (...) openly and in the
face of the Sun triumph gloriously and in every Pamphlet proclaim his victories
to the world. If you shall say, that the Scandal is taken by them, not given by
you: it is (to all but your selves) as much as nothing; whilst the contrary is
demonstrable, and that there is in these very pretensions, a proper (and as I
may say a natural) tendency to produce such effects, as we see to have ensued
thereupon. The truth whereof will evidently appear by stating the Case thus. A
man otherwise rational and conscientious, but somewhat wavering in point of
Religion, yet desiring in sincerity of heart to be of the truer Church, if he
knew which were it, has some temptations offered him by his education,
friends, books, the confusions among us, or otherwise, to incline him toward
the Church of Rome. Which temptations being not able of himself to conquer, he
repaireth to a Presbyterian (suppose) or Independent, he acquainteth him with
his doubts, and desires satisfaction therein: tells him among other things,
that he had a good opinion of the Church of England heretofore, whilst she had
Episcopal government, and a well-formed Liturgy, and did observe Christian
Festivals, and some kind of outward decency in the worship of God, as all the
Churches of Christ had and did in the purest and primitive times; but now that
all these things are laid aside, he must needs be of another mind, unless they
can fully satisfy him concerning the premises. In this Case, I would feign
know what possible satisfaction such a man could receive from either of these,
holding to their Principles. To tell him these things were Popish, and
therefore to be cast out of the Church, were the next way to put him quite off:
he would presently conclude (and it is impossible he should do otherwise, being
already so prepared as in the Case is supposed) that certainly then that which
we call Popery is the old Religion, which in the purest and primitive times was
professed in all Christian Churches throughout the world. That only (...) which
is usually the last Reserve in these disputes, That the mystery of iniquity
began to work betimes; will seem (to him) but a ridiculous begging of the
Question; and he will tell them, that every Sectary may say the same to them.
Whereas the sober English Protestant, is able by the grace of God, with much
evidence of truth, and without forsaking his old principles, to justify the
Church of England, from all imputations of Heresy or Schism, and the Religion
thereof as it stood by Law established from the like imputation of Novelty; and
to apply proper and pertinent answers to all the Objections of those (whether
Papists, or others) that are contrary-minded, to the full satisfaction of all
such, as have not by some partial affection or other rendered themselves
incapable to receive them.

12. I confess I had no purpose (as may appear by the beginning of my Preface)
when I set pen to paper, to have said much, if any thing at all of these
matters: but I had so very much more to say for the pressing of each of these
three Considerations, and the business withal seemed to me of so much
importance, that after I had once begun, I had much ado to repress my self
from drawing this Preface into a yet far greater length. But since I have thus
adventured to unbowel my self, and to lay open the very inmost thoughts of my
heart in this sad business before God and the world: I shall hope to find so
much charity from all my Christian Brethren, as to show me my Error, if in any
thing I have now said I be mistaker, that I may retract it; and to pardon those
excesses in modo loquendi, if they can observe any such, which might possibly
(whilst I was passionately intent upon the matter) unawares drop from my pen,
Civilities which we mutually owe one to another, -- damus hanc veniam,
petimusque vicissim: considering how hard a thing it is, amid so many passions
and infirmities, as our corrupt nature is subject to, to do or say all that is
needful in a weighty business, and not in something or other to over-say and
over do: Yet this I can say in sincerity of my heart, and with Comfort, that
my desire was, (the nature of the business considered) both to speak as plain,
and to offend as little, as might be. If I can approve my carriage herein to
the judgment and consciences of sober and charitable men; it will be some
rejoicing to me; but I am not hereby justified. I must finally stand or fall to
my own master, who is the only infallible Judge of all men's hearts and ways.
Humbly I beseech him to look well if there be any way of wickedness or
hypocrisy in me; timely to cover it himself, and discover it to me, that it
may be by his grace repented of, and pardoned by his mercy; by the same mercy
and grace to guide my feet into the ways of Peace and Truth, and to lead me in
the way everlasting.

WHITE HALL, November 1631.
Eccles. 7.1. A good Name is better then precious


1. WHere the Author professes himself a Preacher, it cannot be improper to
style the treatise a Sermon. This book is such; a Sermon: and, the Preacher
being a King, a Royal Sermon. He took a very large, but withal a very barren
Text. His Text the whole World, with Quicquid agunt homines; vo^um, ^imor, ira,
voluptas, Gaudia, discursus. -- Juvenal. Satyr. 1.
all the under the Sun. From which so large a Text, after as exact a survey
thereof taken, as unwearied diligence in searching, joined with incomparable
wisdom in judging could do, he could not yet with all his skill raise any more
then this one bare conclusion; proposed in the very entrance of his Sermon, as
the only doctrinal point to be insisted upon throughout: Vanity Eccles. 1.2.
of Vanities, says the Preacher, Vanity of Vanities, all is vanity. This he
proves all along by sundry instances, many in number, and various for the
kind, to make the induction perfect: that so having fully established the main
Doctrine, (which he therefore often inculcateth in his passage along,) that all
things in the world are but Vanity, he might the more effectually enforce the
main use which he intended to infer from it, and reserveth (as good Orators
use to do) for the close and epilogue of the whole Sermon; namely, that World
and the Vanities thereof, men should betake themselves to that which alone is
free from vanity, to wit, the fear and service of God, Eccles. 12.13,
Hear the conclusion of the whole matter: fear God, and keep his
Commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.

2. To the men of the world, whose affections are set upon the world, and who
propose and promise to themselves much contentment and happiness from the
things of this world: as the main Doctrine it self is, so are most of the
proofs and passages of the whole Sermon, very paradoxes. We may (not unfitly)
therefore call this Book Solomon's Paradoxes. Look no further then a few of the
next following verses of this very Chapter. To prefer verse 2.
the house before the house of feasting; -- 3.
sorrow before laughter; -- 5.
rebukes before praises; -- 6.
the end of a thing when it shall be no more, before the beginning of it, when
it is growing and coming on; a soft -- 6.
patient suffering spirit before a stout and haughty mind; and -- 12.
learning before riches, as the Preacher here does: what are all these, and
other like many, if we respect the (...). Chrysipp. apud Plutarch. de contrar.
Stoic.
common judgment of the world, but so many Paradoxes? The writings of Zeno,
and Chrysippus* (if we had them extant) with the whole school of Stoics, would
not afford us Paradoxes more or greater, then this little Book of Solomon does.
There are no less then two in Solomon out of the depth of that wisdom,
wherewith God had filled his heart, prefers a good name before precious
Ointment; and the day of death before the day of ones birth. Paradoxes both:
besides the common opinion: but (...). Cleanthes apud ^und.
most agreeable to truth and reason* both; as to him that shall duly examine
them both, will clearly appear. It will find us work enough at this time, to
examine but the former only, in those words. A good Name is better then a
precious ointment.

3. Wherein before I come to the pith of the matter; I cannot Elegancy
observable in the very ba^k and rind of the letters in the Hebrew Text, (...)*
The figure Paronomasia, as Rhetoricians call it; a near affinity both in the
letters and sound, between the words, whereby the two opposite of the
Comparison are expressed, (...) the Name, and (...) the Ointment. Such
allusions and agnominations are no strangers in either of the holy tongues: but
of frequent use both in the Old and New Testaments. Examples might be alleged
many: As out of the Old Testament: Jer. 1.11, 12. Ose. 9.15. Amos 5.5. and 8.2.
Ezekiel. 7.6. And out of the New many more (...) and (...), Joh. 15.2. (...), and
(...), 2 Thessalonians. 3.11. (...), Heb. 11.37. (...). three together, as it were with
a breath Romans 1.29.31. But omitting the rest, I shall commend unto you but two,
but those very remarkable ones out Testament one. The one in Esaias 24. where the
Prophet expressing the variety of Gods inevitable judgments under three
several appellations, Esaias 24.18.
The Fear, the Pit and the Snare; uses three several words, but agreeing much
with one another in letters and sound: (...), Pachadh, the Fear; (...),
Pachath, the Pit: (...), Pach, the Snare. The other in Romans 12. where the
Apostle exhorting men not to think of themselves too highly, but according to
sobriety, sets it off with exquisite elegancy thus, Rom 12.3.
(...).

inconsiderate, (that I say not, uncharitable and unjust) they, that pass their
censures very freely (as I have sometimes heard some do, fondly and rashly
enough) upon Preachers: when now and then in their popular Sermons they let
fall the like elegancies, scattering here and there some flowers of elocution
among. As if all use of Rhetorical ornaments did savor of an unsanctified
spirit; or were the rank superfluities of a carnal wit; or did adulterate,
corrupt, and flatten 1 Pet. 2.2.
the sincere milk of the word. Or as if they that made use of such
exornations, did 2 Cor 4.5.
preach themselves and their own wit, rather then Christ Jesus and his Cross:
or 1 Cor. 2.5.
the Faith of their hearers to stand rather in the wisdom of men then in the
power of God.

5. These are the common Objections, but they are soon answered. I confess
there may be a fault this way, and (in young men especially, before their
judgments are grown to the just ripeness) many times there is: and so far the
exceptions made here against, may be (in some degree) admitted. (...) --
cateraque hujusmodi scitamenta, quae isti (...) -- immodice faciunt and
rancide. A. Gell. 18. noct. 8.
Affectation in this, as in every other thing, is both tedious and ridiculous:
and in this by so much more then in other things, by how much more the
condition of the person, and the nature of the business, require a Preachers
therefore, by a little vanity in this world, take the readiest way to bring,
both their own discretions into question, and the sacred word they handle into
contempt, that play with words as children do with a feather. A too-too

illo verborum habitu vestiuntur. Quintil. 8 in proaem. -- ni^iumque depicta.
^ic. in Oratore.
light-coloured habit, certainly suteth not well with the gravity of a Sermon.
But, as it will not ill-become a sober grave matron (though she will never be
light and garish, yet) to be all decent in her attire; yea and sometimes also
(upon fit occasions) to put on her jewels, and other costlier ornaments: So
neither is it blameworthy, but rather a commendable thing in Preachers of the
Gospel, (though they ought to avoid by all means all fruitless ostentation of a
froathy wit, yet) to endeavor at all times, so far as their gifts and leisure
will permit, to express themselves in pertinent and proper forms of speech; yea
and sometimes also (as occasion may require, Dandum non nihil temporibus atque
auribus, nitidius aliquid atque affectatius postulantibus. Quintil. 12.10.
and especially the disposition and temper of the hearers) to put their matter
into a more accurate and elaborate dress, and to adorn their discourses with
the choicer habiliments

6. Provided, First that it be done seasonably, discreetly, and with judgment
sparingly, and as it were Quod est in dicendo pulcherrimum, sed quum sequitur,
non cum affectatur. Quintil. 8. in proem Sententia sine pigmentis, fucoque
puerili. Cic. 2. de orat.
offering it self fairly, and without enforcement. And secondly, that it be
directed to the right end: Which is, not to gain glory or applause to the
speaker (that is a base and unworthy end:) much less to poison the judgments,
or pervert the consciences of their hearers, by drawing them the more easily
thereby into error or Sin (that is a cursed and pernicious end.) But either
thereby the better to inform the understanding, or Excitatoria lumina. Quin.
12.10.
to work upon the affections, or to quicken the attention, or to succor the
memories, or some other way to please I may not dwell on a by-note: therefore
in brief thus. If Preachers seek with wisdom to find out pleasant words: Rom
15.2. -- hoc ipso proderat, quod pla^ebat. de Cice. Quintil. ibid.
besides the practice of the holy Prophets and Apostles to warrant them
therein, they have our Preachers warrant also for it. Who, as he professes
Eccle. 12.10.
else where the doing of it, so here he has actually done it. Look but at the
very outside, the shel of the letter, and you must grant, that the Preacher
has sound out pleasant words.

7. But where he professes that, he professes another thing withal; without
which pleasant words would be either to none, written should be upright, even
words of Truth. Search we therefore a little into the pith and kirnel of the
matter; and see if he have performed that part also, as well as the other. A
good name is better then a precious ointment, The Terms of the comparison are
(...) and (...); a Name, an Ointment. The common attribute wherein they both
agree is Goodness: The name good, the Ointment good. The difference is in the
inequality of degree: Name and Ointment both good; yet so, that of the two
Goods, the good Name is better then the good Ointment. A good Name I understand
Consentiens laus bonorum. Cic. 2 Tuscul.
the common voice of men, (either all, or most, or best,) does from the
approved evidence of a man's worthy carriage in the constant tenor of his life
and conversation, give Gloria est frequens de aliquo fama cum laud. Cic. 2. de
invent.
a frequent and commendable testimony thereunto.

Term in the comparison: whereas we read it Ointment, the Greek calls it
(...). Sept.
Oil. Between which two though there be some See Luke 7.46.
difference, and accordingly as well in the Greek and Latin tongues as in the
English, that difference is acknowledged by allowing them distinct names (
(...). Eustath in Iliad.

(...). Athenae. lib. 15.


(...) and (...) in the Greek Vnguentum and Oleum in the Latin, as well as
Ointment and Oil in our English:) yet the same Hebrew word comprehends both;
and the words are very often promiscuously and reciprocally used the one for
the other in the Greek, Latin, and most other languages. Because they agree
much in the qualities; and are much of like use: and the most ancient
confections of Ointments did consist for the most part of Oil, with some
addition of herbs, spices, or other ingredients. Yea and even yet, in the most
precious and exquisite ointments, (such as are either most aromatical for
smell, or of most sovereign operation for medicine, ( Vnguentum; oleum condi.
tum.
common oil has a very great part in the confection and is therefore esteemed
as the basis or foundation of all ointments. But whether Oil or Ointment, the
word seems to be here used (by a kind of senecdoche) to signify all the
delights of the sons of men. Because anciently, and in those Eastern countries
See Marsil. Cognat. 2 var. observat. 9.
Oils and Ointments were much in use, and in great request, for pleasing
Recreans membra olei liquor. Plin. 12. not hist. 1.
the senses, for comforting the brain, for refreshing the spirits, for cheering
the Countenance, for suppling the joints, and for sundry other services tending
to delight and cheerfulness: Wherein they abounded even unto wantonness and
luxury. Whose excess therein, as in all other manner of riotous and voluptuous
living, was soon followed by the Greeks: and thence derived into Italy, and
entertained once at Rome, quickly overspread the greatest part of the world,
then under his Empire, as appears by the frequent complaints, and other
passages in the writings of the learned of those times. Not to speak Vnguentis
legatis, non tantum ea legata videntur, quibus unguimur voluptatis causa, sed
et valetudinis. l. in argento. ff. de 9. au^ and arg leg. --
Oils and Ointments then, and ever since, in order to health, as well as
pleasure.

9. The Epithet here given to Ointments, is in some former translations Good;
and so the Hebrew (...) properly signifies: but in our last rendered Precious.
All to one effect, for good things are ever precious; and the better they are,
the more precious. The meaning is, as if Solomon had said; A good name is
better then the most fragrant and odoriferous Oyntmements, which for their
exquisite pleasantness are held in greatest price and estimation.

The word Better, which decideth the whole controversy between the compared
terms, and is the just importance of that which the Hebrews in their idiome
(for want of the comparative degree) express by the preposition (...) prefixed;
must here be understood agreeably to the subject matter, and without reference
to Bonum jucundum. Better; that is to say, more pleasant more contentful:
Solomon says Prove. 22.1
elsewhere; comparing a good name with gold and silver, Desiderabilius, more to
be wished or desired then a precious ointment; or Eligibilius, in the choice to
be preferred before it.

11. From the words thus opened, the whole result is briefly this. A good name
is a thing very worthy to be of every good man highly esteemed; and to be held
much more valuable then riches, pleasures, honors, or whatsoever other outward
things the men of this world can place their utmost felicity in. Wise Solomon
has elsewhere delivered his judgment as positively as may be in this Prima
fere vota, and cunctis notissima templis, Divitiae. Juvenal. Sat. 10.
the chiefest of all the rest in most men's account, the Worldlings Summum
bonum, Riches, (Prove. 22.) Prove. 22.1.
A good name is rather to be chosen then great riches: and loving favor rather
then silver and gold. And the wise son of Sirach also prefers a good name
before Sirac. 41.12, 13.
a thousand great treasures of gold. Observe the gradation; Before gold,
Treasures of gold, great treasures of gold, thousands of great treasures of
gold: ey and put life it self in to boot. Sirach 41. Compare we a little the
most esteemed delights of the sons of men, those ointments that are most
precious in their esteem, with a good name: and see if it do not in

12. If we should take an exact Inventory of all the particulars the World
affords, which worldly men hunt after with such eagerness, that they not only
spend all their strength and travel, but adventure their healths also and lives
in the pursuit; nor so only, but for the obtaining whereof they truck away
their precious souls too: we shall find them all to come under one of these
three styles, whereunto S. John has reduced them, summing them up as it were
in the gross (1 Ioh. 2.) 1 Ioh: 2.16.
The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life. (Haec tria
pro trino numine mundus habet.) Satan tricketh up all his temptations, when he
lays wait for our souls; Riches, honors and pleasures. And to each of these
may the word Ointment in the Text (either by way of Metaphor, or Metonymie of
the adjunct) be very well extended. For Riches first, it appears that
Ointments were of ancient time accounted, and are so taken notice of by
Historians, as a special part of Castris Darij Regis expugnatis, in reliquo
ejus apparatu Alexander cepit scrinium unguentorum. Plin. 13 not. hist. 1.
the royal treasure of Kings and Princes. And therefore are 2 King. 20 13.
the spices and precious Ointments reckoned amongst the things which Hezekiah
showed to the Babylonish when with vain ostentation he desired they should see
the royal wealth and magnificence of his treasures. Ointments also secondly,
were the ensigns and symboles of the greatest honors: as being used in the
solemn consecration and inauguration of men into the Kingly and Priestly
dignities. Among the Heathens Hebrews (as many other of their rites came in
upon that account,) but among the Hebrews, by special appointment from God
himself. Insomuch as Pineda.
some interpreters conceive it not improbable, that Solomon in this place might
have respect to those Regal and Sacerdotall anointings. But above all,
thirdly, Ointments were the special emblems and expressions of mirth and
jollity: and therefore were used in entertainments and at feasts. Testimonies
hereof from the writings of Poets and Historians both Greek and Latin, in
great abundance, besides that, I find them ready v. Franc. Luisin. 2. parerg
16. Bachio observe. in Ps. 22. F.
collected by sundry learned men, There we read Esaias. 61.3.
of the Oil of joy, and Psalm. 45.7.
the Oil of gladness. When thou fastest, says our Savior, do not by an
affected sullenness and sadness make ostentation of thy fasting, as
hypocrites do: but Mat. 6.17, 18.
unge caput etc. make semblance rather, by anointing thy head, and washing thy
face, as if thou were going to a feast, that so thou may be out of the reach
of all temptation to vain glory that way, whilst thou do not appear to men to
fast. When David records in Psalm 23. how bountifully God had dealt with him,
and showed him his goodness plenteously, he sets it forth in this manner;
Psalm 23.5.
Thou have prepared a table before me, thou have anointed my head with Oil,
and my cup runs over. To omit other places, hitherto tends that ironical
speech of our Preacher to the epicure chap. 9. Eccl. 9.7, 8.
Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy drink with a merry heart.
Let thy garments be always white (another sign of rejoicing that,) and let
thy head lack no ointment. Riches, Honors, Pleasures! you see Ointment has
somewhat to do with them all, and so the word may well comprehend them all.

13. Now then to enter into the Comparison: first, all these Ointments (even
the most precious of them) are equally common to Good and Bad. The worst of men
may have as large a share in them, as the best: the most notorious vicious
liver, as the most eminently virtuous person. For though they be in truth
secretly disposed by the most wise and just hand of a divine providence: yet to
the outward appearance (and farther our eye will not pierce,) the dispensation
of them seems to come from chance rather then justice, and fortune rather
then merit. This the Preacher took into his consideration, and complains of
it chap. 9. as one of the great evils and vanities among those that are done
under the sun, that Eccl. 9.1, 3.
all (outward) things come alike to all, and that there is one event to the and
thence infers, that no man can know (so as to pronounce thereof with any
certainty) whether he be in the love or hatred of God, by all that is before
him. If in respect of these outward things there be any difference between the
Good and the Bad; the advantage is rather on the worse side, bad men oftentimes
having a larger portion thereof, then good men as to particulars; that is
counsel to us, and we may not search into those secrets: only we are assured in
the general, that he does it for just and gracious ends best known to himself.
But as to second causes, we see evidently reason enough to satisfy us, why it
should be likely to fall out thus rather then otherwise; if but in this: that
wicked men, what worldly ends they propose to themselves they pursue to the
utmost, not boggling at any thing that they think may conduce to the obtaining
of the same, be it right or wrong; whereas godly and virtuous End and Means,
and will neither pitch upon any unworthy end, nor adventure upon any unlawful
means. Has it not been always seen, and still is, and ever will be (more or
less) to the worlds end, That extorting Usurers oppressing Landlords,
unconscionable Traders, corrupt Magistrates, and griping Officers, have gotten
together the greatest wealth, and most abounded in riches? That obsequious
Flatterers, temporising Sycophants, perfidious Traitors, bold and insolent
intruders, bribing and simoniacal chafferers, have climbed up the highest
rounds of Civil and Ecclesiastical preferments? That men of base beasts then
men, if not Monsters rather then either of both, (such as some of the old
Assyrian and Persian Monarchy, and after them some of the Roman Emperors
were) have surfeited of pleasures to the full, and wallowed in all manner of
luxury and sensuality? Worthless and wicked men may swim up to the chin in
rivers of oil, and have their heads and beards, ey and the very skirts of
their garments too, bedrencht in great abundance with the choysest of these
outward Ointments.

14. But a Good Name, is Peculium bonorum. Gracious and peculiarity in it: as
being (in the ordinary course of Gods providence) the proper effect, and (by
his good blessing) for the most part the most certain temporal reward of Virtue
and Piety. Phil. 4.8.
Si quae virtus, si qua laus, says the Apostle Phil. 2. If there be any
virtue, if there be any praise: As if there could be no praise, where there is
no virtue; no more then there can be a Gloria umbra virtutis est Senec. Epist.
79.
shadow, where there is no body to cast it. It was Heb. 11.2.
by faith (and the fruits of faith) that the Elders obtained a good report. The
projectors of the Tower of Babel aimed by that building to get themselves Genesis
11.4.
a name; and -- 9.
they -- 9.
Babel, a name of Confusion; little comfort or honor to them. Many men are
ambitious of a great name; and sometimes they -- and quidem quod potuerat,
assecu^us est. de Hermocle Valor. Max. 8.14.
get it too: as he that set Diana's Temple on fire, -- vo^o adipis^ndae famae
la^ioris Solin. c. 43.
only to be talked of. But a great name is one thing, and a good name another.
Greatness may get a man a great name; but goodness only a good name. You that
are great men, if you be not good withal; do what you can for the preservation
of your name and memory, use all your best wit and art, spend the most costly
perfumes and precious ointments you have about it: when you have done your
utmost endeavors, we may justly put that rebuke upon you, which the Disciples
did unjustly upon the good woman in the Gospel, Mat. 26.8.
Quorsum perditio haec? whereto serves this wast? Oleum and operam: you shall
not be able, after all this expense of oil and toil, to preserve your names
from stench and putrefaction. It is nothing but godliness and righteousness
that can do that. Prove. 10.7.
The memorial of the just, when Envy and Calumny have done their worst shall
yet be blessed: but the name of the wicked, when Hypocrisy and Flattery have
done their best to prevent it, shall not notwithstanding. A good name then is
therefore first more excellent, then any precious ointment (either in the
letter or metaphor) because less Common.

15. Compare secondly, the delights and comforts, and contents of both: and see
the issue. Oils and Ointments do give exceeding great delight to the senses;
so as scarce any one kind of thing more: which perhaps might be some cause,
why Solomon sensual pleasures. And this they do by three distinct qualities:
whereby they ^ffect three distinct senses. The Qualities are; Laevor, Nitor,
Odor: The Senses affected therewith, Feeling, Seeing, Smelling. The first
Quality is Laevor; a kind of gentle softness, and smoothness, and supple
glibbiness: wherewith the touch is much delighted. Upon which quality David the
father, and Solomon the son, do both reflect in those proverbial speeches of
theirs: where speaking, the one of flattering dissemblers, says Psalm. 55.21.
Molliti super oleum, Their words are softer Psalm. 55. the other of the whorish
woman, says Prove. 5.3.
Her lips drop like a hony-combe; and her mouth is smoother then Oil, Prove. 5.
The second Quality of Oils and Ointments is Nitor, a kind of brightness and
varnish, which they cast upon other bodies, making them loook fresh and
glister: which quality takes the eye, and affects the sight^. As colors
laid in Oil have a graceful verdure and luster beyond those that are not so
laid. Of which quality the Psalmist makes special mention Psalm. 104. where
describing the manifold works of God, among other things he says that God
brings food out of the earth, as namely wine to make glad the Psa. 104.15.
and Oil to make him a cheerful countenance, or (as our last translation has
it, somewhat nearer the letter, but to the same sense,) to make his face to
shine. Their third Quality is Odor; the sweet fragrancy which they send forth
round about them to a good distance: which makes them wondrous pleasant to the
Smell. The Poets therefore sometimes call Ointments and Perfumes -- persusis
liquidis urget odoribus. Hor. 1. carm. 5.
Odoers in the abstract: as if they were nothing else but smell. To Canticles:
Of the Spouse to her well-beloved in the first Chapter, Cant. 1.3.
Because of the savor of thy good Ointments, therefore do the virgins love
thee; And of him again to her, in the fourth Chapter, -- 4.10.
How fair is thy love, my sister, my spouse? how much better is thy love then
wine? and the smell of thine Ointments then all spices? When Mary powered out
her costly spikenard on Christ's feet, the story tells us, that Joh. 12.3.
all the house was filled with the odor of the Ointment. Joh. 12.

16. Ointments then are good and pleasant. But as Aristotle sometimes
pronounced of the Rhodian and Lesbian wine, when he -- utrumque oppido bo^um:
sed (...). A. Gel. 13. noct. Attic. 5.
the Rhodian was good too, but the Lesbian was the pleasanter: so it may as
reasonably be pronounced in the present contest, that though the precious
Ointment, be good and pleasant in his kind, yet the good Name for goodness and
pleasantness is far beyond it. For whereas the precious Ointment, though it
have in it much variety of pleasure in regard of the three now-mentioned
qualities: yet can it bring all that delight no farther then to the outward
senses of Touch, Sight, and Smell: As for that passage in Psalm. 109. Psalm.
109.18.
It shall enter like Oil into his bones: it is perhaps rather to be understood
as an hyperbolical expression; then in rigore loquendi. But as for a good Name,
that pierces farther then either bones or marrow: it enters into the inner
man, and brings rejoicing to the very heart and soul. Prove. 15.30.
A good report makes the bones fat, says Solomon: and that, I ween, is
another-gates matter, then to make the face to shine. This for material Oil.
Then for those other outward things, which for some respects (I told you) might
be also comprehended under the name of Ointments, Riches, Honors, and worldly
Pleasures: alas (...). Eurip. in Hecub. act. 2.
how poor and sorry comforts are they to a man that has forfeited his good
Name; that lives in no credit nor reputation: contempt, and reproach, and
infamy of every honest, or but sober man. Whereas he that by godly and virtuous
actions, by doing justice, and exercising mercy, and ordering himself and his
affiairs discreetly, holds up his good Name and reputation: has that yet to
-- tamen, dum existimatio est integra, facile consolatur honestas egestatem.
Cic. pro Quinct.
comfort himself withal, and to fill his bones as with marrow and fatness;
though encompassed otherwise with many outward Ego si bonam famam mihi
servasso, sat ero dives. Plaut. Mostel. 1.3.
wants and calamities. Without which, even life it self would be unpleasant, I
say not to a perfect Christian only, but even to every ingenuous moral man.
The worthier sort of men among the Heathens, would have chosen rather cruel
deaths, then to have lived infamous under shame and disgrace. And do not those
words of S. Paul (1 Cor. 9.) show, that he was not much otherwise minded, 1
Cor. 9.15.
It were better for me to die, then that any man should make my glorying void.
Thus a good Name is better then any precious Ointment (take properly, or
tropically,) because it yields more solid content and satisfaction to him
that enjoys it, then the other does.

17. Compare them thirdly, in those performances whereunto they enable us. Oils
and Ointments, by a certain penetrative faculty that they have, being well
chafed in, do -- ut corpus unc^ione recreavi. S^nec. Epist. 53.
supple the joints and -- (...) Joach. Camerar. problem. decur. 8.1.
strengthen the sinews very much, and thereby greatly enable the body for
action, making it more nimble and vigorous, then otherwise it would be. Whence
it was, that among the Greeks, and from their example among the Romans, and in
other Nations, those that were to exercise arms, or other feats of activity in
their solemn Exercent patrias oleo labente palestras, Virgil. A^n. 3.
wrestlers, did usually by frictions and anointings, prepare and fit their
bodies for those athletique performances, to do them with more agility and less
weariness. Insoas Chrysostom and other Greek Fathers almost every where use
the words (...) and (...), not only when they speak of those preparatory
advantages, (such as are prayer, fasting, meditation of Christ's sufferings or
of the joys of heaven, and the like) wherewith Christians may fortify and
secure themselves, when they are to enter the combat with their spiritual
enemies; but more generally to signify any preparing or fitting of a person
for action whatsoever.

18. But how much more excellent then is a good Name? which is of such mighty
consequence and advantage for the expediting of any honest enterprise that we
take in hand, either in our Christian course or civil life in this world? It is
an old saying, taken up indeed in relation to another matter somewhat distant
from that we are now treating of; but it holds no less true in this, then in
that other respect: Duo cum faciunt idem, non est idem. Let two men speak --
(...). Euripid. in Hecub. act. 2.
the same words, give the same advice, pursue the same business, drive at the
same design; with equal right, equal means, equal diligence, success is
strangely different, if the one be well thought of, and the other labor of an
ill name. So singular an advantage is it, for the crowning of our endeavors
with good success, to be in a good name. If there be a good opinion held of us,
and our names once up, whether we deserve it or no,: whatsoever we do is well
taken; whatsoever we propose is readily entertained; our counsels, yea, and
rebukes too, carry weight and authority with them. By which means we are
enabled (if we have but grace to make that good use thereof,) to do Nec vero
neglige^da est fama: nec mediocre telum ad res gerendas existimare opor^et
benevolentiam civium. Cic. de amicit.
the more good, to bring the more glory to God, to give better countenance
(...). Chrysostom. Tom. (edit. Savil.) 6. orat. 17.
if we be in an ill name (whether we deserve it or no) all our speeches and
actions are ill-interpreted; no man regards much what we say or do; our
proposals are suspected; our counsels and rebukes, though wholesome and just,
scorned and kicked at: so as those men we speak for, that side we adhere to,
those causes businesses we manage, shall lie under some prejudice, and be like
to speed the worse, for the evil opinion that is held of us. We know well it
should be otherwise: Non quis, sed quid. As the Magistrate that exercises
public judgment, should lay aside all respect of the person, and look at the
cause only: so should we all in our private judgings of other men's speeches
and actions, look barely upon the truth of what they say, and the goodness of
what they do, and accordingly esteem of both; neither better nor worse, more or
less, for whatsoever fore-conceits we may have of the person. Otherwise how can
we avoid the charge of having Jam. 2.1.
the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ the Lord of glory with respect of persons?
But yet since (...). Menand.
men are corrupt, and will be partial this way, do we what we can; and that
the world and the affairs thereof are so much steered by (...). Arist. 1. Rhet.
In homine virtutis opinio valet plurimum. Cic. in Topic.
Opinion: it will be a point of godly wisdom in us, so far to make use of this
common corruption, as not to disadvantage our selves for want of a good Name
and good Opinion, for the doing of that good (whilst we live here among men
subject to such frailties,) which we should set our desires, and bend our
endeavors to do. And so a good name is better then a good ointment, in that it
enableth us to better and worthier performances.

19. Compare them fourthly, in their Extensions: and that both for Place, and
Time. For place first. That Quality of the three before mentioned, which
specially sets a value upon Ointments advancing their price and esteem more
eminently then any other consideration, is their smell: those being ever held
most precious and of greatest delicacy, that excel that way. And herein is the
excellency of the choicest Aromatical Ointments, that they do not only please
the sense, if they be held near to the Organ; but they do also disperse the
fragancy of their scent round about them great distance. Of the sweetest herbs
and flowers the smell is not much perceived, unless they be held somewhat near
to the nostrill: But the smell of a precious ointment will instantly diffuse it
self into every corner, though of a very spacious room; as you heard but now of
the Joh. 12.3.
spiknard powered on our Saviors feet, Ioh. 12. But see how in that very thing,
wherein the excellency of precious Ointments consists, a good Name still
goes beyond it. It is more diffusive, and spreads farther. Of King Vzziah,
so long as he did well and prospered, it is said, that 2 Chr. 26 15.
his name spread far abroad 2 Chronicles. 26. And the Prophet says of the people of
Israel, in respect Ezekiel. 16.14.
her name went forth among the Heathen for her beauty, Ezekiel. 16.

20. Besides, a good Name, as it reaches farther, so it lasts longer then
the most precious Ointments: and so it excels it in Time, as well as of
Place. As for Riches, Pleasures, Honors, and whatsoever other delights of
mortal men, who knows not of what short continuance they are? They many
times Prove. 23.5.
take them wings, and fly away from us, leaving us behind to grieve for the
loss. If it happen they stay with us to the last (as seldom they do;) yet then
is the parting uncomfortable: we can neither secure them from the spoil of
others; nor can they secure us from the wrath of God. However, part we must: if
they leave not us whilst we live, sure enough we shall leave them when we dye.
It may be when we are dead, some pious friend or other may bestow upon our
carkases the cost of Joh. 19.40.
embalming with spices, odours, and ointments: as we see the custom was of
old, both amongst the heathens, and the people of God. And those precious
Ointments may perhaps preserve our dead bodies some few months longer from
putrefaction, then otherwise they would have endured. But at length, howsoever
the worm and the grave will prevail: and we shall turn sooner or later; first
to dirt, and then to dust. And here is the utmost extention, continuance, and
period of the most precious Ointments (literal, or metaphorical) the world can
afford.

21. But a good Name is a thing far more durable. It seldom fault or neglect
in our selves) but continues with us all our life long. At the hour of death
also it stands by us, and gives some Mors tum aequissimo animo appe^itur,
cum suis se laudibus vita occidens consolari potest. Cic. 1 Tuscul.
sweetning unto the bitterness of those last pangs; when our consciences do not
suggest to our expiring thoughts any thing to the contrary, but that we shall
dye desired, and that those that live by us and survive us, will account our
gain by that change to be their loss. Yea, and it remains after death,
precious in the memories, and mouths, and ears, of those that either knew us,
or had heard of us. Surely no ointments are so powerful to preserve our bodily
ashes from corruption, as a good and report is to preserve our piety and virtue
from oblivion. Sirac. 44.14.
Their bodies are buried in peace, but their name lives for evermore. Eccles.
44. And upon this account expressly it is, that the same Ecclesiasticus
elsewhere (as you heard before) prefers -- 41.12.
a good Name, not only before the greatest riches, because it will out-last a
thousand great treasures of gold; but even before life it self, yea before a
good life (at least in this, though in other respects it be below it, as but an
appurtenance thereunto,) that whereas -- 41.13.
a good life has but a few days, a good Name possibly may endure for ever.

22. Now lay all together that has been said, that a good is a more peculiar
blessing; That it brings more solid content; That it enableth us more and to
more worthy performances; That it is of greater extension both for place and
time, reaching farther and lasting longer, then the most precious Ointments,
either literally or metaphorically understood: and then judge, if what Solomon
has here delivered in the Text, how great a Paradox soever it may sound in the
ears of a worldling, be not yet a most certain Truth; viz. That a good name is
better then a precious ointment; and therefore in all reason to be preferred by
every understanding man before Pleasures, Riches, Honors, or whatsoever other
outward delights of worldly men.

23. But it is needful you should be here admonished, (lest what has been
hitherto said should be in any part either mistaken, or misapplyed,) that all
this while I have spoken but of material ointments, and such other
contentments, as the outward things of this world can afford. The pre-eminence
of a good name thus far just, beware you make not unjust by over-stretching.
For there is besides a spiritual Ointment also; an inward anointing, the
anointing of the inner man, the soul and Conscience with Psalm. 45.7.
the oil of the spirit, the saving graces and sweet comforts of the Holy
Ghost; that oil of gladness, wherewith the blessed son of God was anointed
above his fellows and without measure, and whereof all the faithful and elect
children of God are in their measure his fellow partakers. 1 John 2.20:
Ye have an unction from the holy one, says S. John: and again, -- 27.
The anointing which ye have received of him abides in you. This is a singular
and right precious ointment indeed: infinitely more to be preferred before a
good name, then a good name is to be preferred before other common and outward
Ointments. The a good Conscience. God forbid any man should so far tender his
(...). Plutarch.
good name, as for the preservation of it to make shipwreck of the other.
Augustine:
Duae sunt res, Conscientia and Fama etc. says S. Augustine. Two things there
are, says he, whereof every man should be specially chary, and tender his
Conscience, and his Credit. But that, of his Conscience, must be his first
care: this, of his Name and Credit, must be content to come in the second
place. Let him first be sure to guard his Conscience well: and then may he have
a due regard of his good name also. Let it be his first care within, by making
peace with God and in his own breast: that done, (but not before) let him look
abroad if he will, and cast about as well as he can, to strengthen his
Reputation with and before the world.

24. A very preposterous course the mean while is that, which those men take,
that begin at the wrong end; making their Consciences wait upon their Credit.
Alas, that notwithstanding the clear evidence both of Scripture and Reason to
the contrary, after so many sharp reprehensions by the Minister, so many
straight prohibitions by the Magistrate, there should yet be found among our so
many spirits of that desperate unchristian resolution; as, upon the slightest
provoking word that but touches upon their reputation, to be ready either to
challenge, or to accept tho duel: Either of which to do, must needs leave a
deep sting in the Conscience (if yet it be penetrable and not quite seared up;)
since thereby they expose themselves to the greatest hazard, if not inevitable
necessity, of wilful murder either of themselves or their brethren! 2. Alas,
that there should still be found amongst our Clergymen that formerly being
persuaded that our Church-Ceremonies and Service were unlawful, and having
(during such their persuasion) preached against them openly before their
Congregations as unlawful, but have been since convinced in their judgments
of the Lawfulness thereof, should yet withold their conformity thereunto, and
choose rather, not only to expose themselves -- ne pudorem poenitentiamque
fateamini, contumacia vindicatis errorem. Quintil. declam. 17.
to persist in their former error (to the great scandal of their people, and
cheating their own Consciences,) then by acknowledging that they have erred,
adventure the loss of that great reputation they had by their former opposition
gained amongst their credulous followers; 3. Alas that there should still be
found among our People, men who being conscious to themselves of some secret
wrongs done to their brethren in their worldly estate by oppression, fraud, or
other false dealing; do yet hold off from making them just restitution or other
meet compensation for the consciences, whilst they are so fondly tender over
their reputations with others, as rather to continue still dishonest in
retaining, then acknowledge their former dishonesty in obtaining, those
ill-gotten parcels.

25. But leaving all these to the judgment of God and their own hearts, and to
ruminate on that sad Text ( Luke 16.) Luke 16.15.
that which is highly esteemed amongst men, is abomination in the sight of God;
For thee Christian brother who ever thou art, that shall at any time be in a
strait between two evils, shaken with doubtings and distractions, what to do,
when thy Conscience and thy Credit lie both at stake together: thou have a
ready resolution from E malis minimum. As the Merchant in a storm throws his
dear commodities into the sea to save himself* so do thou resolve to
Conscientiae satisfiat: nil in famam laboremus. Senec. 3, de ira. 41.
redeem thy Conscience howsoever, and at any rate; whatsoever betide thy
Credit. I forbid thee not, to be tender of thy good name; (it is an honest
care) but I charge thee upon thy soul, to be more tender of thy Conscience.

26. This admonition premised; I shall now with your patience proceed to some
Inferences, from what has been delivered concerning the excellency of a good
name, and what a precious thing it is. But the more precious it is, the more
grievous first is their Pliny, that there were some Ointments in the shops in
his time, made of such -- (...). Mat. 26.7.
costly ingredients (so great was the riot of those times,) that Exceduntque
quadringentos denarios libra: tanti emitur voluptas aliena. Plin. 13. not.
hist. 3.
every pound weight was sold at 400. Roman pence, which by computation
(allowing to the Roman penny seven pence halfepenny of our coin) comes to
above twenty two pound English: which was fifteen hundred years ago. We would
all think, that man had done a very foul robbery, that should have broken a
shop, and carried thence any considerable quantity of such costly ware. And
must we not then adjudge him a far worse thief, that injuriously takes away a
man's good Name from him; which we have heard to be in many respects far more
precious, then the most precious Ointments can be? But Murder is a Felony of a
higher degree then Theft. Sometimes we pity Thieves: but we detest Murderers.
Yet neither Thieves nor Murderers are more cruel and injurious, Slanderers and
Backbiters, and Talebearers, and Whisperers, and false Accusers are. Those
bereave a man but of his Livelihood, or at most of his Life: but these Ergo

take that from him which is justly In maledicto plus infamiae quam in manu: in
infamia plus poena quam in morte. Quintil. 6. Justit. 2.
more dear to him then either Life or Livelihood.

27. It were to be wished that all malicious and envious persons would lay this
to heart, who seek to raise their own fame upon the ruin of their brothers:
whose daily endeavor it is, and daily practice, to raise scandalous reports of
others, and to cast foul aspersions upon them without cause, to make their
Names unsavory, and thereby to render their persons odious, among such as will

prejudice. But since such mischievous persons will not, or cannot, learn to do
better, having been long accustomed to do ill; no more then a Leopard can
change his spots, or a Blackamore his skin: it will concern us very much, not
to suffer our selves to become receivers to these Thieves, or abetters to these
Murderers, by setting our ears wide open to their detractions; but rather to
suspect him as an impe of Satan, that delights in Satan's office, in being an
accuser of his brethren.

person as Solomon was, may sufficiently inform us of the weakness of that
Plea, which is so often taken up for our own justification, and to put-by the

yet are Malum, aut male coloratum.

usual Plea with us in such cases: That, (...). Chrysostom. orat. 2. in Annam.
so long as we our own Consciences, and are sure our hearts are honest, we are
not to regard the speeches and censures of men. There is a time indeed, and
there are cases, wherein such a Plea will hold good. When men shall go about
by proposing disgraces to fright us out of any part of that duty that by virtue
of our ( general or particular) calling lies upon us; or shall endeavor to

put out our from amongst men, for having done but that which was our bounden
duty to do: in such like cases we may seasonably Nec in ea re, quid aliis
videatur, mihi puto ^u^andum. Mea mihi co^scientia pluris est, quam omnium
sermo. Cic. 12. ad Attic. 27.
comfort our selves in our own innocence; fly for refuge, against the injuries
of tongues into our own consciences, as into a Castle; there repose our selves
with security; dis-regarding the reproaches of evil men, and professing with St
Paul, that 1 Cor. 4.3.
with us it is a very small matter to be judged of them, or of man's judgment.

31. But where we may do more; we are not not to think it Non sat tuum te

enough to satisfy our own consciences: but we are to endeavor as much as in
us lies, to stop the mouths, or at leastwise to manifest our uprightness 2
Cor. 5.1^.
to the consciences of others. What else meant St Peter to exhort Christians
that they should 1 Pet 2.12.
have their conversation honest among the Gentiles? Or St Paul so frequently
and earnestly to fall upon the point of Scandal? or to be so careful in his own
person, to 2 Cor. 8.21.
provide things honest, not only in the sight of God, but in the sight of men
also? or to stir up others to good things by arguments drawn as well from
praise as virtue, from fame as conscience? as you shall find them mixtly
thrown together in the heap, ( Phil. 4.) Phil. 4.8. Apostolici and praecepti
est, and exempli, ut habeamus rationem non conscientiae tantum, sed and famae.
Hieron. (vel Paulin) Epist. 14. ad Celantiam.
Finally brethren, says he, whatsoever things are true, (that is taken from
Conscience;) whatsoever things are honest (that from Fame:) whatsoever (those
from Conscience again; ( whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of
good report, (those again from Fame:) think on these things, etc. To say then,
as sometimes we do, when we are told that such or such doings will be little to
our credit; That other men are not to be 1 Cor. 10.29
judges of our Consciences, but we Romans 14.4.
stand or fall to our own master, and if we do otherwise then well, it is we
(not they) that must answer for it, etc. I say, these are no good answers. If
men were of St Augustins mind, in his book De bono viduitatis (if that book be
his) they would not give them the hearing, Non audiendi It is confessed even by
Heathens, that, for a man wholly to dis-regard what estimation others have of
him, is -- negligere quid de se quisque sentiat non solum arrogantis est, sed
etiam dissoluti. Cic. de offic. lib. 1.
not only arrogance and cruelty, but stupidity too.

Lastly, since a good name is a thing so precious; it should be the great care
of every one of us (next the care of our souls) to keep that unstained: that so
we Phil. 2.1^.
may be blameless as well as harmless, carrying our selves as the sons of God
without rebuke, though we live in the midst of never so crooked, perverse and
untoward a generation. Scandalous behavior will render our names unsavory,
Eccl. 10.1.
as dead flies cause the ointment of the Apothecary to send forth a stinking
savor. Apothecaries precious confections, therefore, to preserve them from
taint and putrefaction. Shall not a Christian be as wise and chary in his
generation, as a shopkeeper in his; to keep the ointment of his good name from
Odor pr^ fam^ ponitur. Schindler. lex. in (...) etc. Genesis 34.^0. Exodus 5.21. 1 Samuel 13.4.
stench and rottenness, which is so incomparably more precious, then the others
are? Truly every man's good word, as he should to live in peace with every man.
You well know, what the Apostle says for that Romans 12.18
( Romans 12.) If it be possible, so much as in you lies, have peace with all
men. That is not solely in our own power, nay it is a thing scarce possible,
(else the If were needless:) so is this too. But yet somewhat we may do toward
it, and possibly by our good endeavors obtain it in a competent measure, (else
the exhortation were bootless:) and so we may do in this too.

33. To excite our care the more hereunto; (although the of the thing it self,
whereof we have spoken so much already, might alone suffice, if it were
seriously considered:) yet consider farther. First, That the preservation of
our good names is a duty, which by the Law of Nature, and the Law of Charity
(and whatsoever belongs to either of these is of the very Law of God) we are
obliged unto. God has ingrafted in our nature, as a spur to virtuous and
laudable actions, an Trahimur omnes laudis studio, and optimus quisque maxima
glori^ ducitur. Cic. pro Archia.
appetency of praise and glory: and expects that we should make use of it
accordingly, so far as it may be servient to those ends for which he gave it,
and so as it be withal subservient to his glory that gave it. And the law of
Charity, binding Romans 13.7. 1 Pet. 2.17.
honor all men, and to preserve the just reputation of our meanest neighbor;
must consequently bind us to do our selves right in the point of honor: for as
much as we also, as men, are included in that generality. Yea, and that a
fortiori too; in as much as the duty of Charity to be performed to our selves,
is to be the rule and measure of that Charity which we owe to our neighbor:
and it is not supposable, that he that has little care of his own, should be
meetly tender of his brothers reputation.

34. Consider secondly, (as but now I touched) that it is partly in our own
power, what other men shall speak and think of us. Not that we are Lords either
of their tongues or thoughts, (for men generally, two things, as absolute Lords
within themselves: Psalm. 12.4.
Our tongues are our own, say they; and Thought is free.) But that we may, if
we behave our selves with godly discretion, win good report, even from those
that in their hearts wish no good to us; or at least put such a muzzle upon
their tongues, that whereas they would with all their hearts 1 Pet. 3 16.
speak evil of us as of evil doers, they shall not dare for shame to accuse our
good conversation in Christ. For -- 13.
who is he that will harm you, says St Peter, if ye be followers of that which
is good? as if he had said, Men that have any shame left in them, will not
lightly offer harm, or to say any harm by you, unless by some miscariage or
other of your own you give them the advantage. The old saying, that every man
is Fortunae suae faber, and so (...). Apostol. Bysant. in param.
Famae too; is not altogether without truth and reason. For seldom does a man
miscarry in the success of his affairs in the world, or labor of an ill name:
but where himself by some sinful infirmity or negligence, some rashness,
credulity, indiscretion, or other oversight, has made a way open for it. This
I note the rather, because it falls out not seldom to be the fate or fault
of very good men, biassed too much by self love and partiality, to impute such
crosses and disgraces as they sometimes meet withal, wholly to the injuries of
wicked men; which, if they would search narrowly at home, they might perhaps
find reason enough sometimes to impute (at least in part) unto themselves.
When, by busy intermedling where they need not; by their heat, violence, and
intemperance of spirit in setting on those things they would fain have done, or
opposing those stiffeness or peremptoriness either way concerning the use of
indifferent things, without due consideration of times, places, persons, and
other circumstances; by partaking with those they think well of so far as to
the justifying of their very errors and exorbitances, and denying on the other
side to such as are not of their own way such fair and just respects, as to
men of their condition are in common civility due; or by some other like
partialities and excesses, they provoke opposition against themselves, their
persons, and good names: from such men especially as do but wait an
opportunity, and would greedily apprehend any occasion, to do them some
displeasure or disgrace.

35. That it may be otherwise, and better with you, Beloved, ponder well I
beseech you, what our Solomon wrote long since, Prove. 19. Prove. 19.3.
The foolishness of man perverteth his way, and his heart fretteth against the
Lord; or, which comes to one, against such persons as the Lord is pleased to
make use of as his rods wherewith to give him due correction. Neither cast off
this care of your good names, by any pretensions of impossibility: which is
another Topique of Sophistry wherewith Satan teaches us to cheat our selves.
It is indeed, and I confess it, something a hard thing, and not simply (...),
to have every man's good word: but I may not yield 3 John 12.
Demetrius has good report of all men, and of the truth it self, says S.
John. Do you what in you lies toward it, and if then men will yet be unjust,
and speak evil of you undeservedly, you have your comforts in God and in
Christ; and some comfort also in the testimony of your own hearts, that you
have faithfully done what was to be done on your part to prevent it, and by
walking honestly and wisely to 2 Cor. 11.12.
cut off occasion from them that seek occasion. But so far as you have been
wanting to your selves in doing your part; so much you take off, both from
Frustra irascimur obtrectactoribus nostris, si eis ipsi obtrectandi materi^m
ministramus. Hieron. Epist. 14
their blame, and from your own comfort. It concerns you to have a great care
good names, because by your care you may do much in it.

36. Consider thirdly, that a good name is far easier kept then recovered. Men
that have had losses in sundry kinds, have in time Sampsons locks were shorn
off, but grew again: Jobs goods and cattle driven, but restored again: the
widows child dead, but revived again: the sheep and the goat in the parable
lost, but found again. But Hominum immortalis est infamia. Plaut. in Persa. 3.1.
the good name once lost, the loss is little better then (...). Hesiod. (...).
desperate. He had need be a good gamster they say, (and to have very good
fortune too,) that is to play an after-game of reputation. The shipwreck of a
good Name, though in most and the most considerable respects it be incomparably
less, yet in this one circumstance it is in some sort even greater, then the
shipwreck of a good Conscience. The loss there may be recovered Repentance,
which is Hieronym. saepe.
tabula secunda post naufragium: as in Act. 27. Act. 27.44.
some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship, got all safe to land.
But when our good names are shipwrackt, all is so shattered in pieces, that it
will be hard to find so much as a board or plank to bring us ashore. And the
Reason of the difference is manifest: which is this. When we have made
shipwreck of our Consciences, we fall into the hands of God: whose mercies are
great, and his compassions fail not; and who, if we timely and unfainedly
repent, is both able and willing to restore us. But when we make shipwreck of
our good names, we fall into the hands of men: whose bowels are narrow, their
tenderest mercies cruel, charity too weak and faint, to raise up our credit
again after it is once ruined. I have some times in my private thoughts likened
a flaw in the Conscience, and a flaw in the good name, to the breaking of a
bone in the body, and the breaking of a Crystal glass or China dish at the
table. In the mischance there is no comparison: a man had better break twenty
glasses or Dishes at his table, then one bone in his body. And so a man had
better receive twenty wounds in his good name, then but a single raze in his
conscience. But yet here the recovery is easier then there. A broken bone may
be set again, and every splinter put in his due place: the setting, and duly
tended after, it may in short time knit as firm again as ever it was, yea and
(as it is said) firmer then ever, so as it will break any where else sooner
then there. But as for the shivers of a broken glass or earthen dish, no art
can piece them so as they shall be either sightly or serviceable: they will not
abide the file nor the hammer, neither soader, nor glue, nor other cement will
fasten them handsomely together. The application is obvious to every
understanding, and therefore I shall spare it. If Simon be once a leper, the
name will stick by him, when the disease has left him. Let him be cleansed
from his leprosy Mat. 26.6.
Simon the Leper to his dying day. Envious and malicious persons apprehend the
truth hereof but too well: one of whose Aphorisms it is, (and they practice
accordingly) Calumniare fortiter, aliquid adhaerebit: Jer. 18.18.
Come and let us smite with the tongue; and be sure to smite deep enough: and
then, though the grief may be cured, the skin grow over again; it is odds but he
will carry some mark or print of it to his grave. It should make us very
careful to preserve names from foul aspersions; because the stains will not
easily (if at all) be scoured off again.

37. But how may that be effectually done, may some say? Absolutely to secure
our selves from false aspersions, truly it is not in our power: and therefore I
can prescribe no course to prevent it. If malice or envy be minded to throw
them on, there is no help for it but patience. But so far as depends upon our
selves, and the likeliest way withal to counter-work the uncharitableness of
others, (to give you a very general answer) is: By 1 Pet. 3.11, -- 13.
eschewing evil and doing good; by walking warily and circumspectly; by living
Tit. 2.12.
soberly, righteously and Godly in this present world. Praise is the reward of
virtue -- vir^u^is, quam necessario gloria, etiamsi tu non agas, consequatur.
Cic. 1. Tuscul.
as you heard: and the foundation of a good name, is a good life. If any man
desire yet more particular directions, as namely what kinds of actions are
especially to be practiced, and what kinds especially to be shunned in order to
this end, I shall commend unto his consideration these five Rules following;
which I shall but briefly point at, the time not suffering me to insist.

38. First, Let him look well to his particular calling, and the diligence and
faithfulness, and carrying himself uprightly and conscionably therein, and be
sure to keep himself within the proper bounds thereof. This Rule is given us 1
These. 4. 1 These. 4.11, 12.
That you study to be quiet, and to do your own business; Why so? That ye may
walk honestly toward them that are without.

39. Secondly, Let him carry himself lowly, dutifully, and respectfully to all
his superiors and betters: to Magistrates, to Ministers, to his Parents, to
his Masters, to the aged, and to all others agreeably to their respective
conditions and relations. And this Rule we Pet. 2. 1 Pet. 2.13, -- 18.
Honor all men, be subject (even to your froward) masters, submit to the King
as supreme, and to governors sent of him, etc. Why? For so is the will of God,
that with well doing you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men.

40. Thirdly, Let him be wise, charitable and moderate (with all brotherly
condescension) in the exercise of his Christian liberty, and the use of
indifferent things. Not standing always upon the utmost of what he may, or
what he may not do; but yielding much from his own liberty for his brothers
sake: considering as well, what (as the case presently stands) is expedient
for him to do in relation to lawful to be done. St Paul gives us the Rule (
Romans 14.) Romans 14.15, 16.
If thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walk thou not charitably, etc.
Let not your good be evil spoken of.

41. Fourthly, Let him be mild, gentle, a lover and maintainer peace and
concord: not violent, or boisterous, or peremptory either in his opinions or
courses: but readier to compose, then to kindle quarrels; and to qualify, then
to exasperate differences. This Rule we have ( Phil. 2.) Phil. 2.14, 15
Do all things without murmurings and disputings. And why so? That you may be
blameless, and harmless, and without rebuke.

42. Fifthly, Let him be liberal and merciful, 1 Timothy 6.8.
willing to communicate the good things that God has lent him for the comfort
and supply of those that stand in need. This Rule I gather out of Psalm. 112.
Psalm. 112.6, -- 9.
The righteous shall be had in an everlasting remembrance. He has dispersed
abroad, he has given to the poor: His righteousness

43. Whosoever observes these directions, his memory shall (if God see it good for
him) be like the remembrance of good Josiah in Ecclesiasticus; Sirac. 4^.1.
like the composition of the perfume made by the art of the Apothecary: sweet
as honey (in the mouths of all that speak of him) and as music at a banquet of
wine (in the ears of all that hear of him.) Or if it be the good pleasure of
God, for the trial of his faith and exercise of his patience, to suffer men to
Mat. 5.11, 12
revile him and to speak all manner of evil against him falsely in this world:
it shall be abundantly his reward in heaven, at the last great day, when every
man (whose name shall be found written in the boook of life) 1 Cor. 4.5.
shall have praise of God, and of his holy Angels, and of all good men.

AD AULAM. Sermon II.
WHITE HALL, November 1632.
Proverbs 16.7. When a man's ways please the Lord, he makes even his


1. THe words contain two blessed fruits of a gracious conversation: the one
more immediate and direct, Acceptance with God; the other more remote and by
consequence from the former, Peace with men. Or if you will, a Duty, and the
Benefit of it: and these two coupled Antecedent, and a Consequent: wherein we
have Gods part and ours. Our part lies in the Antecedent; wherein is supposed
a Duty, which God expects from us ex debito; and that is to frame our ways
so as to please the Lord. Gods part lies in the Consequent: wherein the
benefit is expressed, which (when we have performed the Duty) we may ex
promisso; and that is, to have our enemies to be at peace with us. The
Antecedent in those former words (when a man's ways please the Lord) The
Consequent in these latter ( He makes even his enemies to be at peace with
him.) Of the Antecedent first, wherein three things are observable: The
Subject, the Act, and the Object: The subject, A man's ways: The act, Pleasing:
The object, the Lord. Each of which are first to be opened apart, for the
clearer understanding of the words: and then to be laid together again, for
the better enforcement of the thing contained therein: (when a man's ways
please the Lord.)

2. A man's ways:] That is the subject. A man's (...) -- Basil. in Psalm. 1.
whole carriage in the course of his life, with all his thoughts, speeches and
actions whether good or bad are by an usual Metaphor in the Scriptures called
The ways of a Man. And of these Ways Solomon speaks, rather then of his
Person. Because it is possible, the Lord may graciously accept some man's
person, and yet take just exception at some of his ways. 1. For thus it is;
When a man walks in the beaten track of the world, without ever turning his
feet into God's testimonies; neither that man nor his ways can please the
Lord. 2. Again when a man walks conscionably and constantly in the good ways
of God, without turning aside, either on man and his ways are pleasing unto
God. 3. But then again thirdly, when a man in the more constant course of his
life walks uprightly and in a right way, but yet in some few particularities
treads awry; (either failing in his judgment; or transported with passion; or
drawn on by the example or persuasion of others; or miscarrying through his own
negligence, incogitancy, or other subreption; or overcome by the strength of
some prevalent temptation; or from what other cause soever it may proceed, I
say, when a man thus walking with God in the main, has yet these outsteppings
and deviations upon the by, (neither acted presumptuously, nor issuing from a
heart habitually evil:) although the person of such a man may still be accepted
with God in Christ, and his ways also be well pleasing unto God, in regard of
the main bent thereof; yet in regard of such his sinful deviations, those
particular passages in his ways do not at all please, but rather highly
displease, the sacred Majesty of God.

3. That for the Subject. The Act is, Pleasing: and pleasing has reference to
acceptance. Wherein the endeavor is one thing, and the event another.
Fortuitum est placere, we use to say. A man may have a full intention, and do
his best endeavor to please, and yet event not answering his expectation.
Which is most apparent, when we have to deal with men. For not only men's
dispositions are various one from another, and so there is -- (...). Theogn.
no possibility of pleasing all; because what would please one man, please
another: But even the same man is not alike disposed at all times, and so there
can be no certainty of pleasing any; Because what would please him at one time,
perhaps will not please him at another. Now in propriety of speech, to please
signifies rather the event in finding acceptance, then the endeavor in
seeking it. But when it undergoeth a moral consideration, it is quite contrary:
Then it imports not so much the event (which being not in our power ought not
to be imputed to us, either to our praise or dispraise) as the intention, and
endeavor. So as he may be said to please in a moral sense, that does his best
endeavor to please, however he speed: as S. Paul says of himself, that he 1
Cor. 10.33.
pleased all men in all things, which in the event doubtless he neither did,
(for we know he had -- 16.9.
many adversaries;) neither could do, the thing it self being altogether
impossible. But he did it in his intention and endeavor, as he sundry times
expounds himself. If it be demanded whether of the two is rather meant in the
Text: I answer both are meant; The endeavor principally, and consequently also
the event. For by reason of Gods goodness and unchangableness, there may be a
good assurance of the event, where the desire of pleasing is unfeigned, and the
endeavor faithful. As it Cain in Genesis: Genesis 4.7.
If thou do well, shall thou not be accepted? We may do well, and not find
acceptance with men: but was there ever any thing in the world well done, and
the Lord accepted it not? That for the Act; Pleasing.

4. But actus distinguuntur secundum objecta. Whatsoever the ways are, it is a
part of every man's intention to please howsoever: it is the Object especially
that makes the difference. All men strive to please: but some to please
themselves, some to please other men, and some few to please the Lord. There be
that regard not either, the displeasure of God or man, so they may but please
(...) is S. Peter's word; it signifies as much as self-pleasers: Translations
have well rendered it self-willed: men that will have their own way in every
thing, that will speak their pleasure of every man, that will say what they
list, and do what they list, let who will take offense at it. S. Peter in the
same place where he has given us the name, has also given us part of their
character, 2 Pet. 2.10.
Presumptuous are they says he, and they are not afraid to speak evil of
Dignities. For commonly you may observe it, they that love to please
themselves, seldom please themselves better, then when they have with most
petulancy of spleen vented their disaffection toward them that are in
authority. Which for the most part proceeds from an overweening conceit they
have of their own either wisdom, or wit: although in S. Augustines judgment,
they are quite devoid of both; whose censure of them is sharp, Aug. lib. de
ovibus cap. 9.
Vade stulto homini placet, qui sibi placet. He that casts to please himself,
casts to please a very fool: Nor are they only void of wisdom in his, but
in S. Paul's judgment, also of Christianity; Romans 15.3.
For even Christ pleased not himself Romans 15.

5. Beside S. Peter's (...), these self-pleasers; there are also S. Paul's Ephesians.
6.6. Col. 3.22.
(...) Men-pleasers. And what, is that a fault to? To please other me^ out of a
Christian indulgence, by condescending to their weakness, and gratifying them
in the exercise of that liberty and power we have in things of indifferent
nature; is so far from being a fault, that it is rather a commendable office of
Christian charity, which every man ought to practice. Romans 15.2.
Let every one of us please his neighbor for his good unto edification. But in
lawful things, and so far forth as may tend to edification, and subordinately
to a greater care of pleasing God in the first place. But if we shall seek to
please men beyond this, by doing for their sakes any unlawful thing, or leaving
undone any necessary duty; by accompanying them in their sins, or advancing
their designs in any thing that may offend God: then are we (...) men-pleasers
in an evil sense, and our ways will not please the Lord. S. Paul who in one
place professes men-pleasing ( 1 Cor. 10.33.
Even as I please all men in all things) taking it in the better sense;
protests against it as much in another place Gal. 1.10.
(If I yet pleased taking it in the worse sense.

6. To draw to a head then, we may please our selves, and we should seek to
please our brethren, where these may be done, and the Lord pleased withal: But
when the same ways will not please all, we ought not to be careful to
satisfy others in their unreasonable expectancies, much less our selves in our
own inordinate appetites: but disregarding both our selves and them, bend all
our studies and endeavors to this one point, how we may approve our hearts and
our ways unto the Lord: that is, to God the only Lord, and our Lord and Christ
must be (in the final resolution) the sole object of our pleasing, which is the
substance of the whole words of the Antecedent laid together, which we have
hitherto considered apart, and comes now to be handled. The handling whereof
we shall despatch in three enquiries, whereof two concern the Endeavor, and
one the event. For it may be demanded first, what necessity of pleasing God?
and if it be needful, then secondly, how and by what means it may be done? and
both these belong to the endeavor: and then it may be demanded thirdly,
concerning the event, upon what ground it is that any of our endeavors should
please God?

7. First, that we should endeavor so to walk as to please God. The Apostle
needed not to have Col. 1.10, 11.
prayed so earnestly as he does Col. 1. and that without ceasing; neither to
have adjured us so deeply as he does, 1 These. 4. even 1 Thessalonians. 4.1.
by the Lord Jesus, if it Duty, and also much concern us in point of wisdom so
to do. First, it is a Duty whereunto we stand bound by many obligations. He is
our Master, our Captain, our Father, our King: every of which respects lays a
several necessity upon us of doing our endeavor to please him: if at least
there be in us any care to discharge with faithfulness, and as we ought, the
parts of Servants, of Soldiers, of Sons, of Subjects.

8. First he is our Master. John 13.13.
(Ye call me Lord and Master, and ye say well, for so I am,) and we are his
Servants, Psalm. 116.16.
O Lord I am thy servant, I am thy servant and the son of thy handmaid. And he
is servant that will not strive to please his Master, Tit. 2.9.
( exhort servants to obey their own Masters, and to please them well in all
things. Tit. 2.) Next he is our Captain, Heb. 2.10.
( It became him to make the Captain of their salvation perfect) and we are his
Soldiers, 2 Timothy 2.3.
( thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ, says
St. Paul to Timothy.) We received our prest-mony, and book'd our names Vocati
sumus ad militiam Dei vivi jam tunc, cum in Sacramenti verba respondimus.
Tertul. ad Martyr. cap. 3.
to serve in his wars, when we bound our selves by solemn vow, and took the
Sacrament upon it in our baptism, manfully to fight under his banner, against
sin, the world and the Devil, and to continue his faithful soldiers unto our
lives end. And he is no generous Soldier, 2 Timothy 2.4.
( No man that warreth entangleth himself in the affairs of this life, that he
may please him that has chosen him to be a Savior, 2 Timothy 2.) Thirdly, He is
our Father, and we his Children, 2 Cor. 6.18.
(I will be a father to you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, says the
Lord Almighty:) and when we have any thing of him, we readily speak him by the
name of Father, and that by his own direction, saying, Our Father which art in
heaven. And that Son has neither grace nor good nature in him, that will not
strive to please his Father. It is noted as one of Esau's impieties, whom the
Scripture has branded as Heb. 12.16.
a profane person, Genesis 26.35.
grieved and -- 28.8.
displeased his parents in the choice of his wives. Mal. 1.6.
( If I be a Father, where is mine honor? Mal. 1.) Lastly, He is our King.
Psalm. 95.3.
( The Lord is a great God, and a great King above all Gods) and we are his
subjects -- 100.3.
(his people and the sheep of his pasture) and he is no loyal Subject that will
not strive to please his lawful Sovereign. That form of speech Nehem. 2.5, 7,
etc.
( if it please the King) so frequent in the mouth of Nehemiah, was no affected
strain of Courtship, but a just expression of duty: otherwise that religious
man would never have used it.

9. And yet there may be a time wherein all those obligations pleasing our
earthly Masters, or Captains, or Parents, or Princes. If it be their pleasure
we should do something that lawfully we may not: we must disobey, though we
displease; Only be we sure that to color an evil disobedience, we do not
pretend an unlawfulness where there is none. But we can have no color of plea
for refusing to do the pleasure of our heavenly Lord and Master please him but
what is just and right. With what forehead then can any of us challenge from
him either wages as Servants, or stipends as Soldiers, or provision as Sons, or
protection as Subjects: if we be not careful in every respect to frame our
selves in such sort as to please him? you see it is our duty so to do.

10. Yea and our Wisdom too: in respect of the great benefits we shall reap
thereby. There is one great benefit expressed in the Text; If we please the
Lord he will make our enemies to be at peace with us: of which more anon. The
Scriptures mention many other, out of which number I propose but these three.
First, if we please him preserve us from sinful temptations; Solomon, Eccles.
7. speaking of Eccl. 7.26.
the strange woman, whose heart is as nets and snares, and her hands as bands,
says, that whosoever pleases the Lord shall escape from her, but the sinner shall
be taken by her. He that displeases God by walking in the bypath of sin, God
shall withold his grace from him, and he shall be tempted and foiled: but
whosoever pleases God, by walking in his holy ways, God shall so assist him with
his grace; that when he is tempted, he shall escape. And that is a very great
benefit. Secondly, if we please him he will hear our and grant our petitions in
whatsoever we ask; if what we ask be agreeable to his will, and expedient for
our good: 1 John 3.22.
( whatsoever we ask, we know we receive of him, because we keep his
Commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.) And that is
another very great benefit. Thirdly, if we please him in the mean time, he will
in the end Ea victoria (speaking of Martyrdom) habet and gloriam placendi Deo,
and pradam vivendi in aternum. Tertul. Apolog. cap. 50.
translate us into his heavenly kingdom: whereof he has given us assurance in
the person of Enoch; Heb. 11.5:
whom God translated that he should not see death, because before his
translation he had this testimony that he pleased God. And this is the greatest
benefit that can be imagined.

11. Go then wretched man, that have not cared to displease the pleasing of thy
self, or of some other mortal man; cast up thy bills, examine thy accounts, and
see what thou have gained. 1. By displeasing God thou have strengthened the
hands of those enemies against thee, with whom thou might have been at
peace. 2. Thou have exposed thy self for a prey to those temptations, from
which thou might have escaped. 3. Thou have blocked up the passage against
thine own prayers, that they cannot have access before the throne of grace. 4.
Thou have utterly debarred thy self from ever entering into the kingdom of
glory. All this bewailing the time past, that thou have not sought to please
him better heretofore: and by redeeming the time to come, in seeking to pleas
him better hereafter.

12. Which how and by what means it may best be done is our next Enquiry.
Wherein to give you a general and easy direction, Likeness, and Obedience. For
the first, (...). Aristo. 2. Rhetor.
Similis Simili, is a common saying, and common experience proves it true:
Likeness ever breeds liking: and men we see are best pleased every one with
such notions and expressions as sort best with their own fancies, and with such
companions as are of their own temper. So good Soldiers are best pleased with
those that are valiant like themselves: and good wits with those that are
facetious, like themselves: and good scholars with those that are judicious,
like themselves: and accordingly it is with all other sorts of men in their
kinds. Yea of likeness unto complacency; as that two men, if they be of
different dispositions, as it may be the one of a quick, stirring and active,
the other of a slow, remiss and suffering spirit: or it may be the one of an
open, free and pleasant conversation, the other of a sad close and reserved
temper: although they may be both honest and holy men, yet I say two such men
will take little pleasure either in the company of the other, as experience
also shows. Horat. 1. Epist. 18.
Oderunt hilarem tristes, etc.

13. Now a wicked man is altogether unlike God, both in his inward affections,
and in his outward conversation. He loves the ways of sin, which God hates;
and Psalm. 50.17.
hates to be reformed, Psalm. 10.3.
speaks well of evil men, as the covetous, and others whom God abhors; and
Luke 6.22.
casts out their names as evil, in whom God delights. Is it possible that
God who is 1 John 1.5.
light, should take pleasure in him that is nothing but darkness? and God who
is Joh. 4.24.
a spirit, in him who is nothing but flesh? and God who is 1 John 4.16.
love, in him who is nothing but rancour, and malice, and uncharitableness? and
God who is Psalm. 145.17.
righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works, a just, a merciful, a
bountiful God, in him who is altogether unclean, or unjust, or cruel, or
covetous? It cannot be.

godly, no marvel if both their persons and ways be well pleasing unto God,
being that both their persons are inwardly renewed after his image, and their
ways also outwardly framed after his example. They love what he loves, hate
what he hates in the affections of their hearts; and they are Ephesians. 5.1.
followers of God as dear children in the conversations of their lives. They
desire and endeavor to be 1 Pet. 1.16.
holy as he is holy, Matthew. 5.48.
perfect as he is perfect, and Luk 6 36.
merciful as he their heavenly father is merciful. And as earthly parents,
though they love all their children well, yet commonly love those best, that
are likest themselves: so our pleased with all his children, because they are
indeed all like him, but best pleased with those that neerliest resemble him.
The more we grow in likeness to him, the more shall we grow also in liking
with him.

15. The other thing wherewith to please God, is our Obedience, when he
beholds in our ways a proof of our willing and cheerful subjection to his
most righteous commands. All Superiors are best pleased with those that owe
them service, when they find them most pliable to their wills, and most
careful to observe what is given them in charge: neither are ever so much or so
justly displeased with them, as when they see them to slack their own
obedience, and slight their commands. Do you think the Centurion could have bin
pleased with those he had under him, if Mat. 8.9.
when he said to one Come, he should have gone the other way? and to another
go, he should have stood still? and to another do this, he should have left
that undone, and done the quite contrary? Obedience is a thing 1 Samuel 15.22
more delights then in sacrifice: and the keeping of the commandment, will
please him better then a Bullock that has horns and hoofs. The Apostle gives
this very reason in Romans 8. why Romans 8.7.8.
they that are in the flesh (carnal and worldly men) cannot please God, even
because the carnal mind is not subject to the Law of God, neither indeed can
be, so long as it continues carnal. Intimating that if it could be subject,
it could not chose but please.

16. Great therefore is the vanity of those men, who think to gain and to hold
the favor of God by the outward performances of Fasting, Prayer, Alm's deeds,
hearing Gods word, receiving the holy Sacrament and the like; (just as the
hypocritical Jews of old did by sacrifices and oblations:) when as all the
while their hearts are rotten, and their conversation base. But let not any of
us deceive our selves with vain confidences. For as the Lord of old often cried
down sacrifices by his Prophets, though they were in those times a necessary
and principal part of that holy worship which himself had prescribed: so no
doubt he will now reject these outside services, though otherwise and in
themselves excellent duties in their kinds; if there be no more in them but
mere outside. And they are no better where there is not withal a conscience
made of Obedience. The Lord who Prove. 16.2.
weighs the spirits, (as it is Jer. 17.10.
searches the hearts and reins; sees the falseness of our spirits, and
observes every prevaricating step both of our hearts and lives. There is no
dallying therefore with him: either let us set our hearts and our faces aright,
and Heb. 12.13.
make straight steps to our feet, or our ways will not please the Lord. Psalm.
5.4.
Deus non volens iniquitatem, he is a God that has no pleasure in wickedness
Ps. 5.

17. We have hitherto enquired into the Reasons why we should endeavor to
please the Lord: and into the Means how it may best be done. There remains yet
a third enquiry, which concerns the success or the Event, and that is, how it
comes about, endeavors are, should so far find acceptance with the Lord as
to please him. Likeness indeed will please, and Obedience will please: But
then it should be such a likeness, as will hold at least some tolerable
proportion with the exemplar; such Obedience as will punctually answer the
command: best endeavors as they come from us, and respect us but according to
our merit: he might find in every step we tread just matter of offense, in
none of acceptance. If he should Psalm. 130.3.
mark what is done amiss, and be extreme in it; no flesh living could be able
to please him. It must be therefore upon other and better grounds then any
desert in us, or in our ways, that God is graciously pleased to accept either
of us or them. The Apostle has discovered two of those grounds, and joined
them both together in a short passage in Heb. 13. Heb. 13.21.
(Now the God of peace make you perfect in every good work to do his will,
working in you that which is pleasing in his sight, through Implying that our
good works are pleasing unto him upon these two grounds: First, because he
works them in us; Secondly, because he looks upon us and them in Christ.

18. First, because he works them in us. As we see most men take pleasure in
the rooms of their own contriving, in the engines and manufactures of their own
devising, in the fruits of those trees which themselves have planted. Now the
crooked ways of evil men, that walk according to the course of the world, are
indeed the works of the Devil; he is Ephesians. 2.2.
the spirit that works in the children of disobedience, please the Devil
whose they are: But it is not possible they should please God who sent his Son
into the world, on purpose 1 John 3 8.
to destroy the works of the Devil. And as for those strayings also and
outsteppings, whereof Gods faithfullest servants are now and then guilty,
although they be not the works of the Devil (for he has not now so much power
over them as to work in them) yet are they still Gal. 5.19.
the works of the flesh, as they are called Gal. 5. such works therefore may be
pleasing to the flesh, whose they are; but they are so far from being pleasing
unto God, that they rather Ephesians. 4.30.
grieve his holy Spirit. The works then that must please God, are such as
himself has wrought in us, by that his holy which are therefore called Gal.
5.22.
the fruits of the spirit in the same Gal. 5. as it is said by the Prophet Esaias
26.12.
(O Lord thou will ordain peace for us, for thou also have wrought all our
works in us.) And again in the Psalm, Psalm. 37.23.
(The Lord orders a good man's ways, and makes them acceptable unto himself)
they are therefore acceptable unto him, because they are ordered by him.

19. That is one ground. The other is, because God looks not upon us as we
are in our selves, neither deals with us according to the rigor of a legal
Covenant: but he beholds us Ephesians. 1.6.
(...), beloved one, even Jesus Christ his only son, and as under a Covenant
of Grace. He is Mat. 3.17.
his beloved Son in whom alone he is well pleased for his own sake; and in whom
and for whose sake alone it is, if at any time he be well pleased with any of
us, or with any of our ways. For being by him, and Gal. 3.26.
through faith in his Name, made the children of God by adoption and grace, he
is now pleased with us, as a loving father is with his beloved As a loving
father takes in good part the willing endeavors of his child to do whatsoever
he appoints him, though his performances be very small: So the Lord is
graciously pleased to (...). Nazianz. Orat. 20.
accept of us and our weak services, according to that willingness we have, and
not according to that exactness we want: not weighing our merits, but pardoning
our offenses, and passing by our imperfections, as our loving Father in Jesus
Christ. That is the other ground.

20. And we doubt not, but the acceptance we find with God upon these two
grounds, if seasonably applied, will sustain the soul of every one that truly
fears God, with strong comfort, against two great and common discouragements,
whereunto he may be subject: arising the one from the sense of men's
displeasure; the other from the conscience of his own imperfections. Sometimes
God and his own heart condemn him not, and yet the world does; and that
troubles him: Sometimes God and the world condem him not, and yet his own
heart does; and that troubles him more. If at any time it be either thus or so
with any of us; Let us remember but thus much, and we shall find comfort in it:
That although we can neither please other men at all, nor our selves
sufficiently; yet our works may for all that be graciously accepted by our good
God, and so our ways may please the Lord.

21. But I forbear the amplification of these comforts: that I may proceed
from the Antecedent in those former words (when a man's ways please the Lord)
of which I have spoken hitherto; unto the consequent in the remaining words (
he makes even his enemies to be at peace with him.) Wherein also, as in the
former part, we have three things observable. The Persons, The effect, The
Author. The Persons a man's enemies; The effect, Peace; The author, the Lord.
(He makes a man's enemies to be at peace with him.) The words being of an easy
understanding will therefore need the less opening. Only thus much briefly.
First for the persons, they a man's enemies. And Solomon here supposes it
possible, that a man whose ways please the Lord, may yet have enemies: Nay it
is scarce possible it should be otherwise, Mat. 10.36.
Inimici Domestici, rather then fail, Satan will stir him up enemies out of his
own house. 2. And these enemies are then said to be at pleace with him (which
is the Effect;) when either there is a change wrought in their affections, so
as they now begin to bear him less ill will then formerly they have done; or
when at leastwise their evil affections toward him are so bridled, or their
power so restrained, open hostility, but (whatsoever their thoughts are within)
to carry themselves fairly and peaceably toward him outwardly, so as he is at
a kind of peace with them, or howsoever sustaineth no harm by them. Either of
which when it is done, it is thirdly Psalm. 77.10. juxta vulgat.
Mutatio dexterae excelsi, it is merely the Lords doing, and it may well be
marvelous in our eyes; It is he that a man's enemies to be at peace with him.

22. The scope of the whole words is to instruct us, that the fairest and
likeliest way for us to procure peace with men, is to order our ways so as to
please the Lord. You shall therefore find the favor of God, and the favor of
men often joined together in the Scriptures, as if one were, (and so usually it
is,) a consequent of the other; so it is said of our blessed Savior ( Luke 2*)
that Luke 2.52.
he increased in favor with God and men. Prove. 3.3, 4.
My son, let not mercy and truth forsake thee etc. so shall thou find favor
and good understanding in the sight of God and man, says our Solomon Prove. 3.
And S. Paul Romans 14. Rom 14.18.
(he that in these things serves Christ, is acceptable In all which places,
favor and acceptance with God goes before: favor and approbation with men
follows after.

23. You may see the proof of it in the whole course of the sacred story:
wherein the lords dealing with his own people in this kind is remarkable: When
they started aside to walk after their own counsels, and displeased him, how he
stirred them up enemies round about them; how he sold them into the hands of
those that spoiled them; how he hardened the hearts of all those that contended
with pleased him, how he raised them up friends, how he made their enemies to
bow under them, how he inclined the hearts of strangers and of Pagans to pity
them. Instances are obvious, and therefore I omit them.

24. Of which Effect the first and principal cause is none other then the
overruling hand of God, who not only disposes of all outward things according
to Ephesians. 1.5.
the good pleasure of his will, but has also in his hands the hearts of all
men even of the greatest Prove. 21.1.
Kings, as the rivers of water, to turn them which way soever he will; as
Solomon speaks at the 21th. chapter of this Book. The original there is ((...)
Palge maijm) as you would say, the divisions of waters. Which is not to be
understood of the great rivers, though the greatest of them all, even the wide
and great Sea also is in the hands of God, to turn which way soever he will:
(as he turned the waters of the red sea backwards to let his people go
through, and then turned them forward again to overwhelme their enemies.) But
the allusion there is clearly to the little trenches, whereby in those drier
Eastern countries, husbandmen used to derive water from some fountain or
cistern to the several parts of their (...). -- Homer. Odyss. 11.
gardens, for the better nourishing of their herbs and fruit trees. Now you
know when a gardner has cut many such trenches all over his garden, with what
ease he can turn the water out of any one into any other of those channels:
suffering it to run so long in one, as he thinks good, and then stopping it
thence, and deriving it into another, even as it pleases him, and as he sees
it most conducible for the necessities of his garden: stop the current of any
man's favor and affections in the course wherein it presently runs, and
turn it quite into another channel: drying it up against one man, and deriving
it upon another, even as it seems good in his sight, and as will best serve
other his holy and just purposes; whether he intend to chastise his children,
or to comfort them, or to exercise any other part or passage of his blessed
providence upon them. Thus Exodus 11 2.
he gave his people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so as they lent them
all their precious things at their departure, who but a little before had
consulted the rooting out the whole generation of them. And thus after that in
his just displeasure against them for their sins, Psalm. 106.40.44.
given them over into captivity into their enemies hands; when he was pleased
again with their humiliations, he not only pitied them, himself according to
the multitude of his mercies; but he turned the hatred of their enemies also
into compassion, and made all those that had led them away captives, to pity
them as it is in Psalm 106.

25. The Lord is a God of power, and therefore can work such effects as he
pleases for our peace without any apparent means on our parts. But being
withal a God of order: for the most part therefore, and in the ordinary course
of his providence, he works his own purposes by second causes, and
subordinate means. At probable means for the bringing about of what he has
promised: that although we ought to be persuaded he can, yet we may not presume
he will work our good without our endeavors. Now the subordinate means to be
used on our part, without which we cannot reasonably expect, that God should
make our enemies to be at peace with us; is our fair and amiable conversation
with others. For 1 Pet 3.13.
who will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good? says S. Peter.
As if he had said, so long as you carry your selves graciously and wisely, if
the hearts of your enemies will not be so far wrought upon as to love and
affect you; mouths will be muzled, and their hands manacled from breaking out
into any outrageous either terms or actions of open hostility: so as you shall
enjoy your peace with them in some measure. Though they mean you no good, yet
they shall do you no harm.

26. But it may be objected, both from scripture and experience, that sundry
times when a man's ways are right, and therefore pleasing unto God, his enemies
are nothing less, if not perhaps much more enraged against him then formerly
they were. Our Savior often foretold his Disciples, that they should Mat. 10
2^; and 24.9.
be hated of all men for his sake. And David complains in Psalm 38. of some
that Psalm. 38.20.
against him, eo nomine, and for that very reason, because he was a follower of
that which was good. What a seeming distance is there between the Prophets and
the Apostles speeches? or else how may they be reconciled? 1 Pet. 13.
Who is he that will harm you if you be followers says the one: Yea says the
other, there are some against me, even therefore, because I follow that which
is good, As if by seeking to please God, he had rather lost his friends, then
gained his enemies.

27. There are sundry considerations that may be of good use to us, in the
present difficulty: As First, if God have not yet, made our enemies to be at
peace with us, yet it may be he will do it hereafter, being no way bound to us,
we may give him leave to take his own time. Acts 1.17.
Non est vestrum nosse, if it be not for us to know, much less is it for us to
prescribe the seasons which the Father has kept It is his Prerogative to
appoint the times, it is our Duty to wait Psalm. 27.14.
his leisure. It may be, ( secondly) neither is it unlikely, that we do not
Gal. 2.14.
(...), walk with an even foot, and by a straight line; But tread awry in
something or other which displeases God; and for which he suffers their
enmity to continue. But it is most certain, ( thirdly) that we please him but
imperfectly, and in part: even those graces wherewith we please him, are in us
but imperfectly, and in part. And therefore no marvel, if our peace also be
but imperfect and in part. Possibly he will procure our peace more, when we
please him better.

considerations will reach home, it will sufficiently clear the whole
difficulty, to consider but thus much, (and it is a plain and true answer) that
generally all Scriptures that run upon temporal promises, are to be understood
(...), not as universally, but as commonly true: Or (as some Divines express
it) Melancthon.
cum exceptione crucis, not absolutely and without all exception, but evermore,
with this reservation, unless the Lord, in his infinite wisdom; see cause why
it should be good for us to have it otherwise. But this you shall ever observe
withal, and it infinitely magnifieth the goodness of our gracious Lord and
that blessing in specie which the letter of the promise seems to import; he
yet gives it us eminenter, that is to say, if not that, yet some other thing
fully as good as that, and which he well knows (though perhaps we cannot yet
apprehend it so) to be presently -- mutat utiliori dono. Bernard sermon. 5. de
qu^drag.
far better for us then that. Say he do not give us wealth or advancement, yet
if he give us a contented mind without them, is it not better? Say he do not
speedily remove a temptation from us, whereunder we groan, (which was St Paul's
case;) yet if he supply us 2 C^r. 12.9.
with a sufficiency of grace to encounter with it; is it not better? So in the
present make our enemies to be at peace with us, yet if he teach us to profit
by their enmity, in exercising our faith and patience, in quickening us unto
prayer, in furthering our humiliations, or increasing any other grace in us, is
it not every way and incomparably better? Now will any wise man tax him with
breach of promise, who having promised a pound of silver, gives a talent of
gold? or who can truly say that, that man is not so good much better then his
word?

29. From the words thus cleared may be deduced many profitable Inferences, for
our further instruction; but that the time will not suffer us to enlarge them.
As first, we may hence know, what a blessed thing and desirable Peace is: not
only that inward peace with God, and in our own breasts which Phil. 4.7.
passes all understanding; but even this outward peace with men. When the holy
spirit of God here in the text uses it as an especial strong inducement to
quicken us up the rather to the performance of that with cheerfulness, which we
are in Duty bound to perform howsoever, in seeking to please the Lord. We may
learn hence secondly; If at any time we unfainedly desire peace, by what course
we may be likeliest to procure it. Preposterous is the course, which yet most
of men take, when to make their peace with mortal men, they hazard the
disfavour of the eternal God. The right and ready way is chalked out in the
Text: First to make our peace with God, by ordering our ways so as to please
him, and then to commit our ways to his ordering, by leaving the whole success
to him: and so doing, it is not possible we should miscarry. Those that are now
our enemies, either he will turn their hearts toward us, so as to become our
friends, if he curb and restrain them, that with all their enmity they shall
not be able to do us any harm, if he see that better for us; or if by his just
sufferance they do us harm one way (and yet he will not suffer that neither,
unless he see that absolutely best for us) it shall be recompensed to us by his
good providence, in a far greater comfort another way. We may learn hence, (
Thirdly) how hateful the practice is, and how wretched the condition of
make-bates, tale-b^arers, whisperers, and all those that sow dissension among
brethren. Light and Darkness are not more contrary, then are Gods ways and
theirs. He is the author of peace, and lover of concord: they are the authors
of strife, and discord. It is his work to make a man's enemies to be at peace
with him: it is their business to make a man's friends to be at odds with him.
We may learn hence ( fourthly) if at any time our enemies grow to be at peace
with us, to whom we owe it. Not to our selves; it is a thing beyond our power
or skill to win them: Much less, to them; whose malice is stiff, and will not
easily relent. But it is principally the Lords own work. He is Heb. 13.20.
the God of peace which makes men Psalm. 68.6.
to be of one mind in an house; it is he that -- 46.9.
causes wars to cease in all the earth, and that gives unto his people --
29.11.
the blessing of peace. And therefore the glory of it, and the thanks for it,
belong to him alone.

30. But I willingly omit all further enlargement of these inferences, that I
may somewhat the longer insist upon one other inference only, very needful to
be considered of in these times; which fifthly) if at any time we want peace,
probably to guess where the fault may partly be, and that by arguing from the
Text thus. I read here, that when a man's ways please the Lord, he makes his
enemies to be at peace with him: I find in mine no relenting, but an utter
averseness from peace; Psalm. 120.6.
I am for peace, but when I speak to them thereof, they make them ready to
battle: I have cause therefore to fear that all is not right with me: either
my heart is not right, or my ways are not right; I will examine them both
thoroughly, and search if I can see Psalm. 139.24.
any way of wickedness in me, for which my God may be justly displeased with
me, mine enemies still against me.

31. Thus to be jealous over our selves with a godly jealousy, would not only
work in us a due consideration of our ways, that so we might amend them, if
there be cause: but would be also of right use to prevent two notable pieces of
sophistry, two egregious fallacies, wherewith thousands of us deceive our
selves. The former fallacy is, that we use many times, especially when our
enemies do us manifest wrong, to impute our sufferings wholly to their iniquity,
whereof we should do wiselier to take some of the blame upon our selves. Not at
all to excuse them, whose proceedings are unjust, and for which they shall bear
their own burdens: But to acquit the Lords proceedings, who still is just,
even in those things wherein men are unjust. Their hearts and tongues, and
hands, are against us, only out of that Jam. 1.11.
(...) that superfluity of maliciousness wherewith their naughty hearts abound,
and for to serve their own cursed ends: which is most unjust in them. But the
Lord sundry times hardneth their hearts, and whetteth their tongues, and
strengthens their hands against us in such sort, to chasten us for some
sinful error, neglect, or lust in part still remaining in us unsubdued; which
is most just in him.

heart may be right in the main, and his ways well-pleasing unto God in regard
of the general bent and intention of them: and yet by wrying aside in some one
or a few particulars, he may so offend the Lord, as that he may in his just
displeasure for it, either raise him up new enemies, or else continue the old
ones. As a loving father that has entertained a good opinion of his son, and
is well pleased with his behavior in the generality of his carriage, because
he sees him in most things dutiful and towardly; may yet be so far displeased
with him for some particular neglects, as not only to frown upon Sic parvis
componere magna. Not much otherwise is it in the dealing of our heavenly Father
with his children. We have an experiment of it in David, with whom doubtless
God was well pleased for the main course of his life, otherwise he had never
received that singular testimony from his own mouth, that he was Acts 13.22.
secundum cor, a man after his own heart: yet because he stepped aside, and
that very foulely in The Text says, 2 Samuel 11. that 2 Samuel 11.27.
the thing that David had done displeased the Lord: and that which followed
upon it in the ensuing chapters was, -- 12.11.
the Lord raised up enemies against him for it out of his own house.

33. The other fallacy is, when we cherish in our selves some sinful errors,
either in judgment or practice, as if they were the good ways of God, the
rather for this, that we have enemies, and meet with opposition: as if the
enmity of men were an infallible mark of a right way. The words of the Text ye
see, seem rather to incline quite the other way. Indeed the very truth is,
neither favor or disfavour of men, neither their approving nor opposing, is
any certain mark at all either of a good or of a bad way. Our Solomon has
delivered it positively (and we ought to believe him) Eccl. 9. that Eccles. 9.1.
no man knows either love or hatred, by all that is before them. It is an
error therefore of dangerous consequence, to think that Non ex passione certa
est justitia: sed ex justit^a, passio gloriosa. Aug. 1. Cont. Epist. Parmen. c.
ult.
the enmity of the wicked is an undoubted mark either of truth or goodness. Not
only for that it wants the warrant of truth to support it, (which is common
to it with all other errors:) but for two other especial reasons besides. The
one is, because through blind self-love we are apt to dote upon our own
opinions (...). Nazianz. orat. 34.
private fancies and unwarranted singularities, as if they were the holy ways
of God! The other reason is, because through wretched uncharitableness, we are
apt to stretch the title of the wicked further then we ought. How freely do
some men condemn all that think or do otherwise then themselves, but
especially that any way oppose their courses, as if they were the wicked of the
world, and Persecutors of the godly*

34. For the avoiding of both which mischiefs, it is needful we should rightly
both understand and apply all those places of Scripture which speak of that
Opposition, which is sometimes made truth and goodness, which opposition the
holy Ghost in such like places intended not to deliver as a mark of godliness;
but rather to propose as an Antidote against worldly fears and discouragements:
That if in a way which we know upon other and impregnable evidences to be
certainly right, we meet with opposition; we should not be dismayed at it, as if
some strange thing had befallen us, 1 Pet. 4.12.
(...), Beloved think it not strange, says S. Peter, (concerning all such
trials as these are) as if some strange thing had happened: because it is a thing
that at any time may, and opposition a (...) or mark whereby infallibly to
judge of our ways whether they be right or no (as some out of the strength of
their heat and ignorance have done) is to abuse the holy Scriptures, to pervert
the meaning of the Holy Ghost, and to lead men into a maze of uncertainty and
error. We had all of us need therefore to beware, that we do not like our own
ways so much the better because we have enemies: it is much safer for us to
suspect lest there may be something in us otherwise then should be, for which
the Lord suffers us to have enemies.

35. And now the God of grace and peace give us all grace to order our ways so
as may be pleasing in his sight: and grant to every one of us, First, perfect
peace with him, and in our own consciences; and then such a measure of outward
peace both public and private, with all our enemies round about us, as shall
seem good in his sight. And let the peace of God which passes all
understanding that hear his word and keep it, at this present time and for
evermore. Amen, Amen.

AD AULAM. Sermon III.
NEWARKE 1633.
1 Pet. 2.17. Honor all men, Love the Brotherhood.


1.WHen the Apostles preached the Doctrine of Christian liberty; a fit
opportunity was ministered for Satan's instruments to work their feats upon the
new-converted Christians: false Teachers on the one side, and false Accusers on
the other. For taking advantage from the very name of Liberty, the Enemies of
their Souls were -- (...). 1 Timothy 6.1 -- 3.
(...), to teach them under that pretense to despise their Governors: and no
less ready the enemies of their Faith -- (...). Hic verse. 12.
(...), to speak evil of them under that color, as persons licentious and ill
affected to Government. The preventing of which, whether abuses or
misconstructions of so wholesome a Doctrine, caused the holy Apostles to touch
so often, and to beat so much (as in their writings they have done) Christian
subjection and obedience: as a duty highly concerning all those upon whom the
name of Christ is called, both for their Consciences and Credits sake,
cheerfully to perform. If there be in them at all any care, either to discharge
a good conscience before God, or to preserve their own and the Gospels
reputation before men: they must endeavor both to do -- Verse. 15.
the will of the most wise God, and to put to silence the ignorance of foolish
men, by submitting -- (...). -- verse 13.
to every humane creature that the Lord has set over them for his sake.

2. This I conceive to be the scope of that part of the Chapter whence the Text
is taken: which I now stand not with farther curiosity Peter shuts up his
general Exhortation concerning subjection to Superiors in four short precepts
or Aphorisms of Christian life. [ Honor all men. Love the Brotherhood. Fear
God. Honor the King.] Which four, though considerable also apart, and as each
has a complete sense within it self: may yet not unfitly be ranged, and that
agreeably (as I conceive) to the Apostles intendment, into two combinations.
The two former into one, as thus: Honor all men] but not all men alike: you
must be ready to do all offices of respect and love as occasion serves to
every man, but yet you are to remember brethren in Christ may claim a nearer
and deeper interest in your affections, (and so in the exercise of your charity
too) then they that are without have any reason to do. Honor all men: but
especially love the brotherhood. The two later also into one, thus. Prove. 24.21.
Fear God and the King; where the fear of the one will consist with the fear of
the other. But where they are incompatible, hold fast to the fear of God
howsoever: but even in that case: where ye may not fear the King, you must yet
do him all the honor otherwise that may be. Fear God, yet honor the King too.

3. We shall now hold us to the former Combination only: two Precepts, Honor
all men, love the brotherhood. In either of which we may observe; First the
Duty, what it is: and then how that duty is either extended or limited in
regard of the Object. The Duties are, Honor, and Love. The duty of Honor in
the former Precept: and that extended to every man, Honor all men. The duty of
Love in the later Precept: and that limited to the Brethren, Love the
Brotherhood. Of which in their order: keeping the same method in both; even
this, to consider first Quid hominis, then Quid juris, and lastly Quid facti.
The first, by opening the Duty, and what we are to do: The next, by enquiring
the Obligation, and why we are so to do: The last, by examining our
Performance, and whether we do therein as we ought to do or no. And first of
the former Precept, Honor all men.

Honor properly, is an acknowledgment or -- importat quandam testificationem
de excellentia a^cujus. Aquin. 2 2. qu. 103.1.
testification of some excellency or other in the person honored by some
reverence or observance answerable thereunto. Thus we honor God above all, as
being transcendently excellent: and thus we honor our parents, our Princes,
our betters or superiors in any kind. And thus the word is clearly used in
the last precept of the four in this verse, Honor the King. But so to take it
in this first Precept, would be subject to sundry difficulties and
inconveniences: this especially above the rest, that the Scripture should here
bind us to an impossible thing. Impossible I say, not only ex hypothesi and
by consequent, in regard of the weakness and corruption of our nature; every
good duty impossible to be performed by us without the grace of God preventing
and assisting us:) but impossible ex natura rei, as implying a flat
contradiction within it self. For honoring (in that notion) being the
preferring of some before other some; we should be bound by this Text (were the
word so to be understood) to prefer every man before every other man: which how
it should be possible for us to do, is beyond the wit of man to imagine. For,
to prefer all, is in truth to prefer none: and so the Apostles command to
honor all men, shall be all one upon the point, as if he had directly
forbidden us to honor any man. It is necessary contradiction, and sundry other
absurdities which would follow thereupon, and I omit) to take the word Honor
in this place, in a signification somewhat looser and larger then the former:
so as to import all that esteem or regard, be it more or less, which (either in
justice or charity) is due to any man in respect of his place, person, or
condition; according to the eminency, merit, or exigency of any of them
respectively: together with the willing performance of such just and charitable
offices upon all emergent occasions, as in proportion to any of the said
respects can be reasonably expected. In which sense, it is a possible honor,
not only our Superiors that are over us or a above us; but our Equals too
that are in the same rank with us* yea even our inferiors also, that are below
us, or under us.

5. And in this latitude you shall find the word Honor sometimes used in the
Scriptures: though not so frequently as in the proper signification. You have
one example of it, in the seventh verse of the next Chapter: where S. Peter
enjoyneth husbands to give honor to the wife as to the weaker vessel. It was
far from his meaning doubtless, that the husband should honor the wife with
the honor properly so called, that of Reverence or Subjection: For invert the
right order of things, and to pervert Gods ordinance; who has given man the
preeminence, and commanded 1 Cor. 14.34
the woman to be in subjection. The woman therefore may not by any means 1 Timothy
2.11, 1^.
(...), usurp authority over the man: but it is her duty to (...) -- Ephesians 5.33.
reverence her husband, and she must see that she do it. His meaning clearly
is, that the husband should cherish the as one that (though in some degree of
inferiority,) is yet his yoke fellow, bearing with the weaknesses, whether of
her sex or person, framing to her disposition, and yielding to her desires so
far as reason and wisdom will allow. Being her head, he must not make himself
her slave, by giving her the honor of dutiful observance and obedience: and
yet, being his companion, he may not make her his drudge, by denying her the
honor of a tender respect, and loving condescension. Which kind of honor is
in some measure, and according to their different proportions, due also to be
given by Parents to their children, and by the greatest Masters to the meanest
of their servants.

6. We have another example of the like use of the word 1 Timothy 5. where S. Paul
bids Timothy honor widows that are widows indeed. 1 Timothy 5.3.
Timothy was a man of eminent rank in the Church of God, a Bishop; and that of
no mean See, but of Ephesus a famous city and the chief Metropolis of Asia: and
the Widows he there speaks of, were Hoc omne praeceptmu de his est viduis,
quae Ecclesiae pascuntur eleemosynis. Hieron. adver. Jovinian. lib. 1.
poor old women, such as in those times for the mean services they were to
perform to the Saints were called also Diaconissae, and were therefore to be
maintained out of the contributions of the Church and the common stock. The
parties being of such wide distance, it had been most unseemly for him to have
given to them, but extreme and most ridiculous arrogance in them to have
expected from him, any honor properly so called, honor of reverence and
subjection. But the honor he was to give them was such as was meet for persons
of that quality, especially in relation to their maintenance: that in the
execution of his pastoral charge, amongst his other cares, he should take care
that those widows should be provided for in fitting sort; that so in the
Province of Ephesus there might be no cause of such complaint, as had formerly
been by the Grecians at Jerusalem Acts 6. that Act. 6.1.
their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.

7. In like manner we are to understand the word Honor here in the Text: in
such a notion as may include, (together with the Honor properly so called and
due to Superiors only,) all those fitting respects which are to be given to
Equals and Inferiors also; which is a kind of Honor too, but more improperly
so called. And then it falls in, all one with that of S. Paul Romans 13. [
Render therefore to all their dues: Romans 13.7.
tribute to whom tribute is due, custom to whom custom, fear to whom fear,
honor to whom honor.] As if he had said, I would not any of you should be
behind with any man in any thing: but if you owe him any duty, perform it to
the full. If any honor or respect in whatsoever kind or degree belong to him,
account it as due debt: and let him have it, to the utmost of what can with
justice or in equity be demanded. So that we then fulfill this precept of our
Apostle, Superior, Equal, or Inferior,) secundum gradum and meritum: according
to his place and desert. For those two are, as it were the Standards, whereby
to measure out to every man his proportion of Honor in this kind: That is to
say, every man is to be honored and respected, according to the dignity of his
place, whatsoever his deserts are; and according to the merit of his person,
whatsoever his place and condition be.

8. It would be a tedious, indeed rather an endless task, (and therefore I
undertake it not,) to drive the general into its particulars; and to show what
peculiar honors and respects are due to all estates of men, considered in
their several ranks and mutual relations. It must be the care of every godly
wise man to inform himself the best he can for that matter, so far as may
concern himself, and those whom he may have occasion to converse withal: and
it must be his resolution to give honor to every man accordingly; that is to
say, neither more or less, but as nere as he can understand (within a
convenient latitude) that which is justly his due: Yet let him take this
withal, that where the case is doubtful, it is the safest course (lest
self-love should incline him to be partial,) to pinch rather on his own part,
then on his neighbors, Superior, That is to say, rather to forgo a good part
of that honor, which he may think is due to himself, if he be not very sure of
it: then to keep back any small part of that honor, which (for any good
pssurance he has to the contrary,) may fall due to his neighbor. Agreeably to
the other Apostles advice Romans 12. that (not in taking, but) Romans 12.10.
in giving honor we should go one before another.

9. Now we see, in the meaning of the words, both what duty we are to perform,
and to whom. The Duty, Honor, and that to all men: and all this but Quid
nominis. It may next be demanded, Quid Iuris: upon what tie we stand thus bound
to Honor all men? I answer; Funiculus triplex. There lies a threefold tie
upon us for the performance of this Duty: to wit, of Justice, of Equity, of
Religion. A tie of Justice first: whose most proper and immediate office it is,
suum cuique; to give to every one that which of right appertains to him.
(...) is Aristotle's phrase: but S. Paul's is far beyond it, in the forecited
Romans 13. Render to all their dues, (So we translate it; Romans 13.7.
but the word is) (...): which imports more then (...). It signifies Debts:
accordingly whereunto he says in the next verse there, Owe nothing to any man.
We do not account it discurtesie, but dishonesly, in any man that is able, -- 8.
not to pay debts. Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, Prove. 3.27.
says Solomon Prove. 3. Whosoever withholdeth a debt or due from another, does
an unjust act; and is next akin to a thief: and, as a thief, is bound to
restitution. The other word in the same place Luke 19.8.
(...), which is (...) more then Aristotle's (...): the very same word that is
used, where Zacheus promised fourfold restitution (...) Luke 19. Render or
restore.

10. It is a thing not unworthy the observing, that all those words which
usually signify Honor in the three learned languages, do either primarily
signify, (...). Honos.
or else are derived from such words as do withal signify, either a Price, or
a Weight. Now by the rules of Commutative Justice, the price of every commodity
ought to be according to the true worth of it. And things payable by weight are
by Law and Custom then only current, when they have their due full weight,
and that usually with some draught over, rather then under. Even so it is a
righteous thing with us, to make a just estimate of every man's worth, and to
set a right valuation upon him, so near as we can, respectively to the quality
of his place and his personal desert; and to allow him his full proportion of
Honor accordingly: neither under-rating him in our thoughts, nor setting
lighter by him then we should do, in our carriage and conversation toward him.
A false weight is abominable; and so is every one that tradeth with it: Prove.
11.1.
and certainly that man makes use of a false beam, sets light by his
brother, (or perhaps sets him at naught) whom he ought to honor. The
question is put on sharply by the Apostle, Romans 14.10.
Romans 14. Why do thou set at naught thy brother? as who should say, with
what face, with what conscience can thou do it? He that defalketh any thing
of that just honor which he ought to allow his brother. (let his pretense be
what it can be) how is he not guilty of the sin of Ananias and Saphira, even
according to the letter, Acts 5. ((...), Acts 5.3.
being the phrase there) in keeping back, as they did, part of the full price,
when they should have laid it down all. Thus we are tied in Justice, to honor
all men.

11. The next tie, is that of Equity: where the Rule is, Quod tibi fieri nonvis
-- A rule which Severus a wise Emperor magnified exceedingly: Lamprid. in
Severo.
Lampridius says, that he learnt it of the Christians. And it may very well be
so: for Christ himself commended it to his Disciples, as a perfect breviate of
the whole Law. Whatsoever you would that men should do unto you, Mat. 7.12.
do ye even so to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets. He means, so
far as concerns our dealings and transactions with men. A short lesson, but
of a large comprehension: all one (in the meaning and result) with that (...)
as St James calls it, that Royal Law, which comprehends second Table of the
Law, James 2.8.
with all the several offices reducible to each commandment therein; Thou
shall love thy neighbor as thy self. If we would but once perfectly learn this
one lesson, and soundly follow it, ( Do, as we would be done) sailing always
by that Compass, and framing all our actions by that Rule: we should not need
any other Law for the guiding of our consciences, or other direction for the
ordering of our conversations, in respect of our carriage toward others. But
there is a base wretched pride in us, that disordereth all both within and
without; and will not suffer us to be (I say not just, but even) so much as
reasonable. Like some broken Merchants, that drive their creditors to low
compositions for great sums, but call hard upon their poor neighbors for
petty reckonings that stand uncrost in the book; or the evil servant in the
parable, Mat. 18.24, -- 28.
Mat. 18. who having craved his Masters forbearance for a very vast sum, went
presently and shook his fellow servants by the throat for a trifle; or as young
prodigal heirs, that are ready to borrow of every man that will lend them, but
never take any care to pay scores: so are many of us. -- Nulla retrorsum:
Horat. 1: Epist. 1.
We care not how much honor comes to our selves from others, how little goes
from our selves to others. Nay you shall observe it, (and the reason of it is
manifested* for the same pride that makes men over-prize themselves, makes
them also undervalue betterness, and look for most respect from those that are
below them, are ever the slackest in giving to those that are above them their
due honor. Who so forward (generally) to set bounds, and to give Law to the
higher powers; as those very men, that exercise the most unbounded and
unlimited tyranny, among their poor neighbors and underlings, crowing over
them without all mercy, and beyond all reason? I forbid no man, to maintain the
rights, and to preserve the dignity, that belongs either to his place or
person: rather I hold him much to blame, if qui sibi nequam, cui bonus? He that
is retchless of his own honor, there is no great fear that he will be
over-carefull of doing his neighbor right in giving him his. Let every man
therefore in Gods name take to himself that portion of honor and respect that
is due to him: and good luck may he have with his honor. Provided always,
that he be withal sure of these two things: First, that he take no more then
his due; for this is but just; and then, that he be as willing to give, as to
take; for that is but equal. He that does otherwise, is partial, and
unreasonable. And thus we are tied in Equity,

12. There is yet a third tie; that of Religion: in respect of that image of
God, which is to be found in man. All honor is in regard of some Habe^ justam
venerationem quicquid excellit. Cic. 1. de Not. Deor.
excellency or other: and there is in man no excellency at all, of and from
himself; but all the excellency that is in him, is such only as God has been
pleased to put upon him. So excellency, which God has stamped upon man, as
some image of himself; is the true foundation of all that honor that can any
way belong unto him. And that excellency is twofold: Natural, and Personal. The
Natural excellency is that, whereby Man excels other creatures: the Personal
that, whereby one man excels another.

13. Of the Natural first: which arises from the Image of God stamped upon man
in his creation. And this excellency, being it was put upon the whole species
of mankind, is therefore to be found in all men; and that alike: so as in this
respect, all men honorable, and all alike honorable. Thou that comparing thy
self with thy poorer brother, think thy self the better man, and so
despisest him: compare thy self and him another while in puris naturalibus, and
thou shall find no difference. Take him as a man, he is every way as good a
man as thou: thou carriest a body about thee, no less mortal then his; he
harbors a soul within him, no less immortal then thine And where is the
difference? Well then, here is the first honor we owe to all men, even as they
are men, and that without all either exception (none to be excluded;) or
differences, (none to be preferred) viz. this; that we despise but that as much
as lies in us we preserve the being, and advance the well-being of every man:
and that because of Gods Image set upon him. As when a piece of base metal is
coined with the Kings stamp, and made current by his edict; no man may
thenceforth presume either to refuse it in pay, or to abate the value of it: So
God having stamped his own image upon every man, and withal signified his
blessed pleasure how precious he would have him to be in our eyes and esteem
(according as you shall find the tenor of the Edict in Genesis 9. At the hand of
every man's brother will I require the life of man; Genesis 9.3.
with the reason of the edict for in the image of God made he man:) we must
look to answer it as an high contempt of that sacred Majesty, if we set any man
at naught, or make less account of him, then God would have us. The
contumelious usage of the image, is in common construction ever understood as a
dishonor meant to the Prototype: upon which consideration it was, that the
Romans when they meant to set a mark of public disgrace or dishonor upon any
eminent person, did manifest their such intention, by throwing down, breaking,
trampling upon, or doing some other like disgrace unto, their statu^es or
pictures. And Solomon in sundry oppressing, Prove. 14 31. -- 17.5.
mocking, or otherwise despising our neighbors, not without a strong reflection
upon God himself; as tending to the contempt and dishonor of him their Maker.

Natural, God has put upon man a Personal Excellency: which is an effect of
his Providence in the Government of the world, as the former was of his Power
in the Creation of it. And here first begins the difference that is between
one man and another. That saying, Homo homini quantum praestat, has no place,
till you come to this. And that in regard of Gods free distribution of several
gifts, and offices, and callings to several men, with admirable variety, and
with no less admirable wisdom. Alius sic, alius vero sic: Even as the members
of the natural body, besides life (which is common to them all) have also their
several abilities, functions, and operations, 1 Cor. 7.7.
with much different variety each from other. And as the members according to
those differences are differently honored (one kind of honor belonging to
the head, another to the hand, another to the feet, and so to the rest, 1 Cor.
12.23.
according as they are some more, some less honorable:) so in the world men
receive different honors according to their different capacities; the King in
one kind, the Priest in another, the Soldier, the Husbandman, the Artificer,
and so all the rest in other kinds. It is an observation of some Divines, that
there is some image of God (though I think it were better to call it Vestigium
or Umbra, imago, a shadow rather then image) some weak reprehension and dark
resemblance (they mean) in Kings of his absolute Sovereignty, in Judges and
Magistrates of his Justice, in Priests of his holiness, in Old men of his
Eternity, in Parents of his Causality, in Counselors of his wisdom, in Learned
men of his knowledge, in artificers and laborers of his operative power, etc.
A conceit, to my understanding neither so light, as to be rejected for a mere
fancy; neither yet so solid, as to build a firm conclusion upon, to satisfy
either judgment or conscience. But whether that conceit stand or fall, certain
it is howsoever, that it is Gods stamp alone Excellency, whether Natural or
Personal, and thereby renders it honorable. For whether we consider men's
Personal Excellencies, quoad statum and gradum, according to their different
particular places, callings, and conditions; or quoad meritum, according to
their different particular graces, abilities, and qualifications: still they
have their rise merely from Gods gracious distributions: who has put them into
those places by his all-ruling providence, and imparted those graces to them by
his powerful dispensation. Since therefore not the meanest man in the world but
has received from God some Personal Excellency kind or other, and in some
degree or other, whereby he may become some way or other useful and serviceable
to humane society (some very few excepted, as infants, natural fools, and
distracted persons; whose personal defects yet are by way of meditation and
reflection useful to others, and so they not to be despised, but as less
honorable members to be therefore rather the more carefully and tenderly
respected) there ought to be therefore 1 Cor. 12 23.
even the very meanest, some kind and degree of respect and honor,
proportionable to that excellency. And thus in regard of the Image of God
shining both in their nature and persons, we are tied in Religion, to honor
all men.

15. We have seen hitherto both the Duty, and the Obligation of it; Quid
nominis, and Quid Iuris; What we are to perform, and why? We come now to the
Quid facti, to examine a little how it is performed among us. Sla^kly and
untowardly enough no doubt, (as to the generality:) as all other duties are.
Are there not some first, who are so far from honoring all men, as the Text
requires, themselves only excepted) they honor no man at all: at least, not
as they ought to do? No, not their known Superiors? but how much less then
their Equals or Inferiors? Despising governments in their hearts, 2 Pet. 2.10^
and speaking evil of Dignities with their mouths, and kicking against
authority with their heels. No matter what shows and professions men make of I
know not what respect and observance; (They honor the King and the Church, and
are in charity with all the world: it were pity they should live else.) But
quid verba audiam, facta cum videam? Let protestations go, and look into the
practice. How do they honor the Magistrate, that decline as much as they can
all needful services for his support; and repine the Minister, that grudge him
the portion, which if not by the ordinance of God (for that they think will
bear a dispute) yet without all contradiction is settled upon him Pe^ lege^ and
con^ue^udines Anglia.
by the same (and therefore by as strong a) title, as they hold their own
inheritances by, and are ever studying to find out new devices and quillets to
put him beside it? Or how their Equals, to get aloft depresse their brethren by
odious comparisons, or (which is worse) disparage them by false suggestions? Or
how their Inferiors, that trample them under their feet, as they do the clay
in the streets; and use them with less regard many times, then they do the dogs
that Luke 16.
as the rich glutton did poor Lazarus?

16. There are others secondly, that may perhaps be persuaded to yield some
honor to their betters; (that may be but reason:) but that they should be
bound to honor those that are not so good men as themselves, or at the most
but such like as themselves are, they see no great reason for that. But there
is no remedy: St Peter here tells them, that must be done too. He that says
Honor all men, Matthew. 18.10.
excludes none; no not the lowest and meanest. Take heed that ye despise not
one of these little ones (Mat. 18.) there is a kind of honor (it seems) due
to the little ones; and they may not be despised. Eccles. 9.16.
The poor man's wisdom is despised, says the Preacher Eccles. 9. He says, it
is so; and so it is, but too often, through the pride of the great and wealthy,
Psalm. 123.4.
(as it is said in the Psalm, Our soul is filled with the scornful reproof of
the wealthy, and with the despitefulness of the) but he does not say, it should
be so. Jobs carriage was otherwise, in so far that he disavoweth it, and
protests against it utterly [ If I did despise the cause of my manservant or
of my maidservant, when they contended with me, etc. Job 31.13.
] He would afford the meanest servants he had the honor, to debate the matter
with them; and if there were reason on their side, to allow it. The greatest
subject in the land need not think it any disparagement to him, to give a just
respect to a very mean person: if he will but remember, that it is the duty
even of the King himself, to vouchsafe that honor to the poorest beggar within
his Realm, as to protect him from violence, and to require an account of his
blood, though it should be a Lord.

17. And yet behold a greater then Job, (although, I take it, he was a King too
within his own territories) a greater then any of the great Kings of the earth,
ready to teach us this duty by his example; even our Lord Jesus Christ: Phil.
2.5, etc.
and the same mind should be in us, that was in him. And what was that? He was
pleased so far to honor us, (base, sinful, unworthy creatures as we were) as
for our sakes to lay aside his own greatness, emptying and devesting himself of
glory and Majesty, making himself of no reputation, and taking upon him the
form of a servant. Ill do they follow either his Example, or his Apostles
Doctrine here, who think themselves too good to condescend to men of low
estate, by doing them any office of service or respect; though they need it
never so much, Romans 12.16.
crave it never so often, deserve it never so well. And they, who look another
way in the day of their brothers distress: as the Priest and Levite passed by
the wounded man in the parable, without regard. Luke 10.
And (not to multiply particulars) all they, who having power and opportunity
thereunto, neglect either to reward those that have worth in them, according to
their merit; or to protect those that are wronged, according to their
innocence; or to relieve those that are in want, necessity.

18. There are a third sort, that corrupt a good Text with an ill gloss; by
putting in a conditional limitation: like the bodging in of a course shred into
a fine garment; as thus. The Magistrate shall have his tribute, the Minister
his tithe, and so every other man his due honor: if so be he carry himself
worthily, and as he ought to do in his place, and so as to deserve it. In good
time! But I pray you then first (to argue the cause a little with thee, who
ever thou art that thus glossest) Who must judge of his carriage, and whether
he deserve such honor, yea, or no? Why, that thou hopest good justice, where
he that is a party will allow no other to be judge but himself. Where the
debtor must arbitrate what is due to the creditor, things are like to come to a
fair reckoning.

19. But secondly, how dare thou distinguish where the Law commands, he
looks to be answered with Obedience: and do thou think to come off with
subtilties and distinctions? The precept here in the Text is plain and
peremptory; admits no Equivocation, Exception, or Reservation; suggesteth
nothing that should make it reasonable to restrain the Universality expressed
therein by any such limitation: and therefore will not endure to be eluded with
any forced Gloss.

20. Least of all thirdly, with such a Gloss, as the Apostle has already
precluded by his own comment, in the next verse: where he bids servants to
be subject to their Masters, not only to the but to the froward also, and such
as would be ready to buffet them when they had done no fault. Such Masters sure
could challenge no great honor from their servants, titulo meriti, and as by
way of desert: But yet there belonged to them jure dominij, and by virtue of
their Mastership, the honor of Obedience and Subjection. Which honor, due
unto them by that right, they had a good title to: and it might not be detained
from them either in part or in whole by cavilling at their desert.

21. But tell me fourthly in good earnest, do thou believe, that another man's
neglect of his duty can discharge thee from the obligation of thine? -- dic
Quintiliane colorem. Can thou produce any public Law, or private Contract,
or sound Reason, wherenn to ground; or but handsome Color, wherewith to
varnish over, such an imagination? Fac quod tuum est: do thou thy part
therefore, and honor him according to his place howsoever, He shall answer,
and not thou, for his unworthiness, if he deserve it not: but thou alone shall
answer for the neglect of thine performest it not.

22. Lastly, ex ore tuo. When thou say, thou will honor him according to
his place, if he deserve it; do thou not observe that thou art still unjust
by thy own confession? For where place and merit concur, there is a double
honor due: ( The Elders that rule well are worthy of double honor 1 Timothy 5.)
There is one honor due to the place, 1 Timothy 5.17.
and another to merit. He that is (...). Chrysostom. in Coloss. Sermon. 3.

-- (...). Ibid.


in the place, though without desert, is yet worthy of a single honor, for his
place sake; and justice requires he should have it. But if he deserve well in
his place, by rightly discharging his duty therein, a double honor; and
justice requires he should have that too. Consider now how unjust thou art. If
he deserve well, say thou, he shall have the honor due to his place:
otherwise not. Thou might as well say in plain terms: If he double honor, I
can be content to afford the single: otherwise he must be content to go
without any. Now what justice, what conscience in this dealing, where two parts
are due, to allow but one; and where one is due, to allow just none?

23. But I proceed no further in this argument; having purposely omitted sundry
things that occurred to my meditations herein, and contracted the rest, that I
might have time to speak something to the later precept also, Love the
brotherhood. To which I now pass, hoping to dispatch it with convenient
brevity: observing the same method, as before, Quid nominis, Quid juris, Quid
facti; What we are to do, and Why, and how we perform it.

Adam and Christ are Totum genus humanum quodammodo sunt homines duo etc.
Prosper. sentent. c. 299.
the two roots of mankind; Adam as in state of Nature, and Christ as in a
state of Grace: so there is -- (...). Basil. homil. in Lazi^is.
a twofold Brotherhood amongst men, correspondent thereunto. First, a
Brotherhood of Nature, by propagation from the loins of Adam, as we are men:
and secondly a Brotherhood of Grace, by profession of the faith of Christ, as
we are Christian men. As men, we are Membra suinus corporis magni: Natura nos
cognatos edidit. Senec. Epist. 95.
members of that great body, the World: and so all men that live within the
compass of the World are Brethren, by a more general communion of Nature. As
Christians, we are members of that mystical body, the Church: and so all
Christian men that live within the compass of the Church are Brethren, by a
more peculiar communion of Faith. And as the Moral Law binds us to love all
men as our Brethren, and partakers with us of the same common Nature in Adam:
so the Evangelical Law binds to love all Christians as our Brethren, and
partakers with us of the same common faith in Christ.

25. In which later notion the word Brother is most usually taken in the
Apostolical writings: to signify a professor of the Christian Faith and
Religion, in opposition to heathen men and unbeleevers. Christian, though of
commonest use and longest continuance, was yet but of a later date; taken up
first at Antioch, as we find Act. 11. whereas believers were before usually
called Disciples; and no less usually, both before and since, Brethren. You
shall read very often in the Acts, Act. 11.26.
and Epistles of the holy Apostles, How the Brethren assembled together to hear
the Gospel preached, to receive the Sacrament, and to consult about the affairs
of the Church. How the Apostles, as they went from place to place, to plant and
water the Churches, in their progress every where visited the Brethren: at
their first coming to the Brethren; during their abode there, Act. 15.36. --
21.7. -- 15.22. -- 18.18. -- 11.29. 2 Cor. 8.18. -- 23. 1 Cor. 8.12.
confirming the Brethren; at their departure thence, taking leave of the
Brethren. How collections were made for relief of the Brethren; and those sent
into Judea from other parts by the hands of the brethren, etc. S. Paul opposes
the Brethren, to them that are without; and so includes all that are within,
the Church. What have I to do to judge them that are without? 1 Cor. 5. As if he
had said; the Churches; and therefore I meddle not but with those that are
within the pale of the Church: as for those that are without, if any of them
will be filthy, let him be filthy still, I have nothing to do to meddle with
them. But says he, if any man that is within the Christian Church, any man
that is called a Brother, be a fornicator, or drunkard, or rayler, or otherwise
stain his holy profession by scandalous living; I know how to deal with him:
let the censures of the Church be laid upon him, let him be cast out of the
assemblies of the Brethren, that he may be thereby brought to shame and
repentance.

26. So then, Brethren (in the Apostolical use of the word) are Christians: and
the Brotherhood the whole society of Christian men, the systeme and body of the
whole visible Church of Christ. I say the visible Church: because there is
indeed another Brotherhood more excellent then this whereof we now speak,
consisting of such only as shall undoubtedly inherit salvation; called by some
of the ancients The Church of Gods Elect, and by some later writers the
Invisible Church. And truly this Brotherhood would (under God) deserve the
highest room in our affections; could we with any certainty discern who were of
it, and who not. But because the fan is not in 2 Timothy 2.19.
to winnow the chaff from the wheat, (Dominus novit) The Lord only knows who
are his by those secret characters of Grace and Perseverance, which no eye of
man is able to discern in another, (nor perhaps in himself infallibly: (we are
therefore for the discharge of our duty to look at the Brotherhood so far as it
is discernable to us by the plain and legible characters of Baptism and outward
profession. So that whosoever abides in area Domini, and lives in the
communion of the visible Church, being baptized into Christ, and professing the
Name of Christ: (let him prove as it falls out, chaff, or light corn, or
wheat, when the Lord shall come to purge his floor:) yet in the mean time so
long as he lies in the heap and upon the floor; We must own him for a
Christian, and take him as one of the Brotherhood, and as such an one love him.
For so is the Duty here, Love the Brotherhood.

27. To make Love complete, Two things are required: according to Aristotle's
description of it, (...) etc. Affectus cordis, and Effectus operis. The inward
affection of the heart, in wishing to him we love all good: and the outward
manifestation of that affection by our deed as occasion is offered, in being
ready to our power to do him any good. The heart is the root and the seat of
all true love: and there we must begin; or else all we do is but lost. If we do
never so many serviceable offices to our brethren, out of any by-end or
sinister respect; although they may possibly be very useful, and so very
acceptable to him: yet if our heart be not toward them, if there be not a
sincere affection within, it cannot be truly Love. That Love, that will abide
the test, and answer the Duty required in the Text, must be such, as the
Apostles have in several passages described it: (...) unfeigned love of the
brethren, 1 Pet. 1. Love out of a pure heart, 1 Timothy 1. Love without
dissimulation, Romans 12. 1 Pet. 1* 22. 1 Timothy 1.5. Romans 12.9.


28. Of which inward affection the outward deed is the best discoverer: and
therefore that must come on too, to make the love perfect. As Iehu said to
Ionadab, Is thy heart right? If it be, then give me thy hand. 4 King. 10.15.
As in the exercises of our devotion toward God, so in the exercises of our
charity toward men; heart and hand should go together. Probatio dilectionis,
exhibitio est operis. Lam 3.41. Gregor.
works are the best demonstrations, as of true Faith, so of true love. Where
there is life and heat, there will be action. There is no life then in that
Faith, (S. James calls it plainly a dead faith Iam. 2.) nor heat in that
Love, Jam. 2.26.
(according to that expression Matthew. 24. the love of many shall wax cold:)
that does not put forth it self in the works of righteousness and mercy. Matthew.
24.12.
He then loves not the Brotherhood indeed, whatsoever he pretend, or at least
not in so gracious a measure as he should endeavor after: That does not take
every fit opportunity of doing good either to the souls, or bodies, or credits,
or estates of his Brethren; That is not willing services, according to the
urgency of their occasions, and the just exigence of circumstances, with his
countenance, with his advice, with his pains, with his purse, yea and (if need
be) with his very life too. This is the Non ultra: farther then this we cannot
go in the expressing of our love; (Greater love then this has no man, that a
man lay down his life for his friend: Joh. 15.13.
) and thus far we must go if God call us to it. So far went Christ for our
redemption: and so far the Scriptures press his example for our imitation. (
Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: 1 John 3.16.
and we ought to lay down our lives for the Brethren.

29. To recollect the premises, and to give you the full meaning of the precept
at once. To Love the Brotherhood, is as much as to bear a special affection to
all Christians more then to Heathens; and to manifest the same proportionably
by performing all loving offices to them upon every fit occasion to the utmost
of our powers. A duty of such importance, that our Apostle, though here in the
Text he do but only name it in the bunch among other duties; yet afterward in
this Epistle seems to require it in a more special manner, and after a sort
above other duties (Above all things have Chap. 4. 1 Pet. 4.8.
) And S. John upon the performance hereof hangs one of the strongest
assurances we can have of our being in Christ. ( We know that we are passed
from death to life because we love the brethren. 1 John 3.14.

30. Now of the Obligation of this duty, (for that is the next two main
grounds; Goodness, and Neerness. First, we must love the Brotherhood for their
goodness. All goodness is lovely. There grows a Love due to every creature of
God from this, 1 Timothy 4.4.
that every creature of God is good. Some goodness God has communicated to
every thing to which he gave a being: as a beam of that incomprehensible
light, and a drop of that infinite Ocean of goodness, which he himself is. But
a greater measure of Love is due to man then to other Creatures, by how much
God has made him better then them. And to every particular man that has any
special goodness in him, there is a special due, proportionable to the kind
and meas^re thereof: So that whatsoever goodness we can discern in any man, we
ought to love it in him, and to love him for it; whatsoever faults or defects
are apparently enough to be found in him otherways. He that has good natural
parts, if he have little in him that is good besides, yet is to be loved even
for those parts, because they are good. He that has but good moralities only
leading a civil life, though without any probable evidences of grace appearing
in him, is yet to be loved of us, if but for those moralities, because they
also are good. But he that goes higher, and by the goodness of his
conversation the graciousness of his heart, deserves by so much an higher room
in our affections, then either of the former, by how much Grace exceeds in
goodness both Nature and Morality. Since then there is a special goodness in the
Brethren (quatenus such) in regard of that most holy faith which they profess,
and that blessed name of Christ which is called upon them: we are therefore
bound to love them with a special affection, and that eo nomine under that
consideration as they are brethren, over and above that general love with which
we are bound to love them as men; or that which belongs to them as men of or
as Civil men.

31. The other ground of Loving the Brotherhood is their Neerness. The nearer,
the dearer, we say: and there are few relations nearer, then that of
brotherhood. But no brotherhood in the world so closely and surely knit
together, and with so many and strong ties, as the fraternity of Christians in
the communion of Saints, which is the Brotherhood in the Text. In which one
brotherhood, it is not easy to reckon how many brotherhoods are contained:
Behold some of many. First, we are Brethren by propagation; and that Vnde estis
omnes fratres ostendite. De uno patr^ Christo, and de una matre Ecclesia.
Arnob. in Psalm 133. Rom 8.29. Heb. 1.3. Gal. 3.26.-27.
ab utroque parente: (...) as well as (...). Children of the one Eternal God,
the common father of us all, and of the one Catholic the common mother of us
all. And we have all the same Elder brother, Jesus Christ; the first born among
many brethren, the lively image of his fathers person, and indeed the
foundation of the whole Brotherhood: for we are all (as many of us as have been
baptized Therefore as Joseph loved Benjamin, his brother of the whole blood,
more affectionately then the other ten, that were his brethren but by the
fathers side only: so we ought with a more special affection to love those that
are also the sons of our mother the Church, as Christians; then those that are
but the sons of God, only as Creatures.

32. Secondly, we are Brethren by education: (...), Foster-brethren; as Herod
and Manahon were. Act. 13.1.
We are all nursed with the same (...) the sincere milk of the word, in the
scriptures of the Old and New Testament, which are ubera matris Ecclesiae, 1
Pet 2.2.
that measure of stature of strength, whatsoever it is, that we have in Christ.
(...), says Aristotle: and common experience shows it so to be. They that
have been nursed, or brought up together in their childehood, for the most part
have their affections so seasoned and settled then, that they love one another
the better while they live.

33. Thirdly, we are Brethren by Covenant, sworn brothers at our holy Baptism,
when we dedicated our selves to Gods service as Soldiers by sacred and solemn
vow. Do we not see men that take the same oath, Legionarij equites cohortes
suas contubernij affectione venerantur. Veg^t 2.21. Commilitium auget charita
tem. l. de haered. ff. de castrens pecul.
pressed to serve in the same Wars and under the same Captains, Contu^ernales
and Comrades: how they do not only call Brothers, but hold together as
Brothers, and show themselves marvelous zealous in one another behalf, taking
their parts, and pawning their credits for them, and sharing their fortunes
with them. If one of them have but a little silver in his purse, his brother
shall not want whiles that lasts. Shame we with it that the children of this
world should be kinder ((...)) toward those of their own generation, then we
are in

34. Fourthly we are Brethren by Cohabitation. We are all of one house and
family: not strangers and forrainers, but fellow-citizens with the Saints, and
of the household of God. Ephesians. 2.19.
What a disquietness, (and discredit both,) is it to a house, where the
children are ever jarring, and snarling, and fighting one with another: Psalm.
133.1. etc.
but a goodly sight (Ecce quam bonum) when they dwell together in love and
unity: Even so, a sad thing it is, and very grievous to the soul of every good
man, when in the Church, (which is the house of God) Christians that call
themselves brethren, fall soul biting and nipping and devouring one another,
as if they were bent to consume and destroy one another. But a most blessed
thing on the other side, pleasant as the holy oil distilling from Aarons head
upon his beard and garments, and rejoicing the heart as the dew upon the
mountains refreshes the grass: when there is nothing done in the house through
strife or vain glory, but such an accord Phil. 2.23.
that all the Brethren are of one mind and judgment; or if not always so, yet
at leastwise of one heart and affection; Gal 6.2. Romans 15.1.
bearing the burdens, and bearing with the infirmities, one of another; and
ready upon all occasions to do good, as to all men generally and without
exception, so especially to their Brethren, that are of the same household of
faith with them.

Gal. 6.10.
35. Lastly, we are Brethren by partnership in our Fathers estate. Coparceners
in the state of Grace; all of us enjoying the same promises, liberties, and
privileges whereof we are already possessed in common; and Coheirs in the
state of Glory; all of us having reversion. For being the sons of God, we are
all heirs; and being brethren, all joynt-heirs (...) of one and the same
glorious inheritance reserved for us in the heavens: Gal 4.7. Romans 8.17. Jude.
Verse. 3.
which St. Jude therefore calls the common salvation. It argues a base
wrangling spirit in us, having such goodly things in reversion; (enough for us
all, so as heart can wish no more:) to squabble and fall out for such poor
trifles as the things of this world are. We that have by Gods goodness
competent sustenance for our journey, and full sacks to open at our coming
home; as Joseph's brethren had when they came out of Egypt to return to their
own land: shall we fall out among our selves, by the way? Genesis 45.23.


36. Having all these Obligations upon us, and being tied together in one
Brotherhood by so many bands of unity and affection; I presume we cannot doubt
de Iure, but that it is our bounden duty thus to love the Brotherhood. There
remains now no more to be done, but to look to our performances, that they be
right: wherein the main thing we are to take heed of, (besides what has been
already applied,) is Partiality. I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus
Christ, 1 Timothy 5.21.
and the elect Angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one
before another, doing nothing by Partiality. It was S. Paul's Timothy in another
business: but may suit very well with this also.

27. Not but that we may, (and in most cases must,) make a difference between
one brother and another, in the measure and degree of our Love: according to
the different measures and degrees, either of their goodness considered in
themselves, or of their neerness in relation to us: those two considerations
being (as you heard) the grounds of our Love. So David loved Jonathan as his
own soul; his heart was knit to him: both because he was a good man, and had
withal approved himself his trusty friend. Yea, our blessed Savior Love to
John, then to any other of his disciples (the disciple whom Jesus loved:) for
no other known reason so much as for this, Joh. 13.23.
that he was near of kin to him, his own mothers sisters son, as is generally
supposed. No reasonable a greater love unto, and consequently to be readier to
do good unto (caeteris paribus) our Countrymen, our neighbors, our kindred,
our friends; then to those that are strangers to us, and stand in no such
relation. And so no doubt we may, and ought in like manner (upon that other
ground of Goodness) more to love, and to show kindness sooner to a sober,
discreet, judicious, peaceable, humble, and otherwise orderly and regular man (
caeteris paribus;) then to one that is lightheaded, or lazy, or turbulent, or
proud, or debauched, or heretical, or schismatical.

proviso or limitation, which I now twice mentioned, caeteris paribus, must he
remembered: for there may such a disparity arise by emergent occasions, as may
render a mere stranger, a heathen, a notoriously vicious person, a fitter
object of our compassion, help, or relief, pro hic and nunc, then the most
pious Christian, or our dearest friend or ally. In cases of great extremity,
where the necessities of the party importune a present succor, and will admit
no delay, Cedat necessitudo necessitati: the former considerations, whether of
Neerness or Goodness must be waved for the present, and give way to those
Necessities. He is most our neighbor, and brother, in a case of that nature,
that stands in most need of our wounded traveller in the parable, Luke 10.
Nor does this at all contradict what has been already delivered concerning the
preferring of the brethren before others, either in the affection of love, or
in the offices which flow therefrom. For the affection first: it is clear, that
although some acts of compassion and charity be exercised toward a stranger,
yea even an enemy that has great need of it, rather then toward a friend or
brother, that has either no need at all, or very little in comparison of the
other: it does not hinder but that the Habit or affection of love in the heart,
may notwithstanding brother or friend, then toward the enemy or stranger, as
every man's own reason and experience in himself can tell him. And as for the
outward acts and offices of love, it is with them, as with the offices of all
other virtues and gracious habits or affections: which not binding ad semper
(as the graces and habits themselves do) are therefore variable and mutable, as
the circumstances by which they must be regulated vary pro hic and nunc. And
therefore the rules given concerning them, must not be punctually and
mathematically interpreted; but prudentially, and rationally: and hold (as we
use to say in the communiter, but not universaliter; that is to say, ordinarily
and in most cases, where circumstances do not require it should be otherwise,
but not absolutely and universally, so as to admit of no exception.

39. This rub then thus removed out of the way: it may yet be demanded, where
is this partiality to be found whereof we Jam. 2.1.
or what is it to have the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ with respect of
persons? if this putting of a difference in our love between brother and
brother, (which we have now allowed of,) be not it? I answer; It is no
partiality, to make such a difference as we have hitherto allowed: so long as
the said difference is taken from other peculiar and just respects, and not
from the very condition of Brotherhood it self, or any distinction made
therein. But here is that evil partiality we are to take heed of: when we
restrain the Brotherhood to some one party or society in the Church, such as we
think good of, and exclude the rest, as if they had no part nor fellowship
Brotherhood; nor consequently any right to that special affection wherewith we
are to love the Brethren. Which partiality has indeed been the very bane of
the Churches unity and peace; and the chiefest cause both of the beginning and
continuance of most of the schisms, under which Christendom has groaned from
time to time.

40 Not to speak of the Donatists and other Schismatics of old, who confined
the Church to some little corner of the world: for which they were soundly
confuted by S. Augustine, Optatus, and other godly Fathers of their times;
First of all, extremely partial in this kind are the Romish party at this day.
Who, contrary to all truth and reason, make the Roman and the Catholic Church
external Communion with them and subjection to their Bishop, as a condition so
essentially requisite for the qualifying of any person to be a member of that
Church of Christ, out of which there is no salvation, as that they have
inserted a clause to that purpose into the very Coet^^ hominum sub regimine
legitimorum pastorum, ac prae^ipue unius Christi in terris vicarij Romani
Pontificis. Bellarm. 3. de Eccl. militi.
definition of a Church. So cutting off from this brotherhood in a manner
wholly, all the spacious Churches of Africa and Asia; together with all those
both Eastern and Western Churches of Europe also, which dare not submit to so
vast a power as the Bishops of Rome pretend to, nor can think themselves
obliged to receive all their dictates for undoubted articles of Faith.

41. The like Partiality appears secondly in our brethren of the separation.
Marvel not that I call them Quia collegium Episcopale nolunt nobiscum habere
commune; non sunt Collegae, si nolunt: tamen fratres sunt. Optat. lib. 1. --
praeceptum nobis divinitus ut etiam ij qui negant se fratres nostros esse,
dicamus, fratres nostri estis Aug. Epi. 203. (...). Nazi. orat. 33.
brethren; though they will by no means own us as such: the more unjust and
uncharitable they. And in this uncharitableness (such a coincidence there is
sometimes of extremes) the Separatists and the Romanists, consequently to their
otherwise most distant principles, do fully agree: like Samsons foxes tied
together by the tails to set all on fire, although their faces look quite
contrary ways. But we envy not either these, or those, their
uncharitableness; nor may we imitate them therein. But as the Orthodox Fathers
did the wayward Donatists then, uncharitable brethren (as well of the one sort,
as the other) our Brethren still, whether they will thank us for it or no;
Velint, nolint, fratres sunt. These our Brethren: I say of the Separation, are
so violent and peremptory Vnchurching all the world but themselves: that they
thrust and pen up the whole Flock of Christ in a far narrower pingle, then ever
the Donatists did: concluding the Communion of Saints within the compass of a
private parlour or two in Amsterdam.

42. And it were much to be wished in the third place, that some in our own
Church, who have not yet directly denied us to be their Brethren, had not some
of the leaven of this Partiality hidden in their breasts. They would hardly else
be so much swelled up with an high opinion of themselves, nor so much sowred in
their affections toward their brethren: as they bewray themselves to be, by
using the terms of Brotherhood, of Profession, of Christianity, the Communion
the Godly Party, and the like; as titles of distinction to difference some few
in the Church, (a disaffected party to the established Government and
Ceremonies,) from the rest. As if all but themselves were scarce to be owned,
either as Brethren, or Professors, or Christians, or Saints, or Godly men. Who
knows of what ill consequence, the usage of such apropriating and distinctive
titles (that sound so like the Pharisees, I am holier then thou; Esaias 65.5.
and warpe so much toward a separation) may prove, and what evil effects they
may produce in future? But how ever it is not well done of any of us in forms
and phrases, and to accustom our selves to a garb of speaking in
Scripture Language, but in a different notion from that wherein the Scriptures
understand it. I may not, I cannot judge any man's heart: but truly to me it
seems scarce a possible thing for any man that appropriateth the name of
Brethren (or any of those other titles of the same extent) to some part only of
the Christian Church, to fulfill our Apostles precept here of loving the
brotherhood, according to the true meaning thereof. For whom he takes not in,
he must needs leave out: and then he can love them but as those that are
without: Perhaps wish them well, pray for civil respect, etc. which is no more
then he might or would do to a very Jew, Turk, or Pagan.

43. As for us, beloved brethren, let us in the name and fear of God beware of
all rotten or corrupt partiality, in the performance either of this, or of any
other Christian duty, either to God or man. And let us humbly beseech the God
of all grace and peace, to put into our hearts a spirit of Wisdom and Charity,
that we may duly both honor and love all men in such sort as becomes us to
do: but especially that we may love and honor him above all, who has already
so loved and honored us as to make us Christians; and ^ath love, honor, and
reward all those that seek his honor and glory. To whom be all honor and
glory ascribed etc.


BEVVOYR JULY 1636.
Psalm 19.13. Keep back thy servant from presumptuous sins: Let them


1. THis Psalm is one of David's Meditations. That it is David's, we have it from
To the chief Musician, a Psalm of David* verse 1.
the Title in the beginning: That it is a Meditation, from Let -- and
meditation of my heart be, etc. verse 14.
the close in the end of it. Now there are but two things especially, whereon
to employ our meditations with profit, (to the right knowledge Calvin. 1.
Instit. 1. Huic duplici considerationi tota hac vestra vacatio tribuatur: sicut
Sanctus orabat, Deus, Noverim me, Noverim te. Bernard. sermon. 2. de diversis.
some have therefore reduced the whole body of Divinity:) God, and our selves.
And the meditation is then most both complete and fruitful, when it takes in
both. Which is to be done; either via ascensus, when we begin below and at our
selves, and so build upwards, raising our thoughts higher to the contemplation
of God: or via decensus: when we begin aloft downwards, drawing our thoughts
home upon our selves.

2. This later is the method of this Psalm: in the former part whereof David
begins as high, as at the most Highest; and then descends as low as to
himself, in the later. For the succouring of his Meditations there, he makes
use of the Est Natura liber primus, Scriptura secundus: Altera Posse docens,
altera Velle Dei. Jo. Rai. chiliad. Epigr.
two great Books: that of Nature, or of the Works of God; and that of
Scripture, or of the Word of God. In that, he reads the Power: in this, the
Will of his Maker. That declares his Glory: this reveals his Pleasure. That
from the beginning of the Psalm, ( The heavens declare) to the end of the sixth
verse: This from the beginning of the seventh verse (The Law of the Lord is
perfect etc. --) to the end of the eleventh verse.

3. Hence coming to reflect upon himself, he has now use of Vnicuique est
liber sua conscientia: and ad hunc librum discutiendum* and emendandum* omnes
alij inventi sunt. Bern de inter. domo. c. 28.
a third Book; that of his own conscience, wherein are enrolled the principal
acts and passages of his whole life: That by a just service of the particulars
therein enregistred, he might observe what proportion he had held in the course
of his bypast life, both with that actual obedience, which some other
creatures perform in their kinds, as also (and that especially) with that --
Conferamus itaque libros nost^os cum libro vitae. Ibid.
exact obedience, known sins presenting them in such numberless troops unto his
thoughts, besides a world of unknown ones: as not a little aghast to see so
large a Roll so full and so thick written ( intus and a tergo;) he is forced to
break out into this passionate acknowledgment, Quis intelligit? What living
soul is able to understand all his errors? Who can tell how often he has
offended? in the next former verse.

4. But quid tristes querimoniae? Misery finds small ease in (...). Homer.
Iliad. (...).
complaints: it rather craveth real and speedy succor. The Prophet therefore
upon the first apprehension of the multitude of his sins, instantly addresseth
himself unto God for remedy by Prayer. And his suit therein is double: the one
for Mercy, for the time past; the other for Grace, for the time to come. The
one, that he might be freed from the guilt and defilement of the sins he had
hitherto done, known or unknown: ( O cleanse thou me even from my most secret
sins:) in the remainder of that verse. The other, that he might be preserved
from contracting the guilt or falling under the dominion of any sin thence
forward, presumptuous sin, in this thirteenth verse ( keep back -- etc.

5. The words then are a Prayer: wherein we may observe distinctly and apart,
the Object matter of the Prayer, the Petitions made concerning that Object; and
the Reasons brought to enforce five. First, and principally, the Object matter
of the whole Prayer; those sins, concerning and against which the Prayer is
made: styled here in our translations, Presumptuous Sins. Secondly, and
Thirdly, two Petitions concerning those sins: The one antecedently, that God
would not suffer him to fall into them, [ keep back thy servant from
presumptuous sins;] 3. The other by way of reserve, that at least he would not
suffer him to fall under the dominion of them, [Let them that have dominion
over me.] Fourthly, and fifthly, two Reasons fitted to the aforesaid Petitions.
The one fitted to the former Petition, taken from relative condition, as being
one of Gods servants. Of all sorts of men, Presumption is most hateful in a
servant; and such am I to thee O Lord: keep back thy servant therefore from
presumptuous sins. 5. The other Reason fitted to the later Petition, taken from
the benefit he should reap by the grant. If God should please to keep him free
from the dominion of those sins, he should not doubt (his many failings
otherwise notwithstanding) but by his mercy to stand rectus in curia, innocent
and upright (through his gracious acceptance) from the great transgression of
total and final Apostasy. [ Then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent
from the great transgression.]

6. My purpose is not, to treat of each of those particulars, as I have
proposed them, apart: but to insist principally, upon that which is the most
principal, to which also (as being the common matter or argument of the whole
verse,) they do all in some sort referr, and upon that account will be
occasionally taken in every one of them somewhere or other in our passage, in
the handling thereof; I mean the Object; here expressed by the name of
Presumptuous sins. Wherein I know not how to proceed, more pertinently to the
scope of the Text, and profitably to edification; then by making threefold
plain discovery. First, of the Nature of these sins; that we may the sooner
learn to know them: Secondly, of their danger; that we may be the more careful
to shun them: and Thirdly, of the means of their prevention; that by the help
of God we may be the better able to escape them.

7. Some difference there is in the reading. Which as I may not wholly baulke;
(for without the clearing of that, all the ensuing discourse might be suspected
to labor of impertinency:) so I shall not long insist upon; for the profit
would not countervail the pains. The Septuagint have, (...), and the Vulgar
Latin following them, ab alienis parce -- etc. Some of the Fathers, and most
of the Expositors of the middle and later Ages, led (as commonly they are) by
one of those Translations, conceive the meaning, as if David had here prayed,
to be kept from communicating with other men in their sins, and from enwraping
himself (by any kind or degree of consent) within the guilt of their
transgressions. Which truly is a very needful First, because, although that
were granted the truer reading, the words might yet without much enforcement
bear a construction agreeable to our present entendment: and accordingly Sensus
fere idem est. Bellarm. hic.
some that follow that reading have so understood them. But secondly, and
especially, because the mistake in the Greek and Latin translations grew
apparently from the near affinity of character between the two Hebrew letters
(...) and (...) which has occasioned the like mistake in sundry other words,
noted in the Sea Engelbert. Eng. praefat. ad Schindler. lex. pentaglot.
Hebrew and some also between these very words As Mal 3.15; 4.1. Zach. 12.10,
etc.
Zarim and Zadim in other places of Scripture, as well as in this. But since
the constant reading in all Copies extant is with Daleth and not Resh; and so
not only the old Hebrew Doctors, with Vatablus, Junius, etc.
the learnedest Expositors of this last Age, but some of the ancient Fathers
also, S. Hieron. vertit. a Superbis. Bellarm.
St Hierom by name (who was among them all incomparably the best skilled in the
Original) have expounded it: we need not put our selves to any farther business
for this matter, but take the common reading as it is in our English
translations both Old and New, [ Keep back thy servant from presumptuous sins.

8. And then the first thing we have to do, is to lay open the Nature of these
presumptuous sins: for that is ever the first question that every man will ask
concerning any thing proposed to debate under any name or notion; What does
that name or word import? To presume then, in the common use and notion of the
word with us, imports ever a kind of confidence or boldness in the Presumer.
And it may be taken, either in a good, or in a bad sense: but more usually in
the bad; as (by reason of common abuses) most other indifferent words are. He
that has a fast friend, that he thinks will support him, will sometimes
adventure upon an undertaking, friend to rely upon. When a man does so; we say,
he presumes upon that friend: that is, he is confident, that friend will not
fail to assist him therein to his utmost power: Now if a man be bold to do but
what he may and should do, and that withal he have some good ground for his
confidence, (from the consideration of his friends ability, the experience of
his love, some former promises on his friends, or merit on his own part, or
other like) so as every man would be ready to say he had reason to presume so
far of his friend: this is a good, reasonable, presumption. But if he fail in
either respect, as if he presume either to do unlawful, unworthy, or
unbefitting things; or to do even lawful things, when there appears no great
cause why any man should think his friend obliged by the presumption, a faulty
and an evil presumption. And whatsoever may bear the name of a Presumptuous sin
in any respect, is some way or other tainted with such an evil irrational
presumption.

9. But we are further to note, that presumption in the worser sense, and as
applied to sin, may be taken either Materially, or Formally. If these terms
seem obscure; with a little opening I hope the difference between these two
will be easily understood. Taken materially, the sin of Presumption is a
special kind of sin, distinguished from other species of sins by its proper
Object or Matter: when the very matter wherein we sin, and whereby we offend
God, Presumption: and so it is a branch of Pride. When a man presuming either
upon his own strength, or upon Gods assisting him, undertaketh to do something
of himself, not having in himself (by the ordinary course of nature, and the
common aid which God affoordeth to the actions of his creatures in the ordinary
ways of his providence) sufficient strength to go through therewithal: or
expects to receive some extraordinary assistance from the Mercy, Power etc.
of God, not having any sufficient ground (either from the general promises
contained in the Scriptures, or by particular immediate revelation) that God
will certainly so assist him therein.

overvalue themselves, or out of an overweening conceit of their own abilities
attempt things beyond their power; That lean to their own understandings, as
Solomon; Prove. 3.5. Romans 12.16. Psalm. 131.1.
That mind high things, and are wise in their own conceits, as St Paul; That
exercise themselves in great matters, and such as are too high for them, as
David expresses it. All those that persuade themselves they can persist in a
holy course without a continual supply of Grace; or that think they can
continue in their sins so long as they think good, and then repent of them and
forsake them at their leisure whenever they list; or that doubt not but to be
able by their own to stand out against any temptation: All these I say, and all
other like, by presuming too much upon themselves, are guilty of the sin of
Presumption: To omit the Poets, who have set forth the folly of this kind of
Presumption in the Fables of Phaethon, and Icarus: A notable example we have of
it in the Apostle Peter, (and therein a fair warning for others not to be high
minded but to fear) who in the great confidence of his own strength, Romans 11.20.
could not believe his Master (though he knew him to be the God of truth) when
he foretold him he would yield; but still protested, Mat. 26.33.
that if all the world should forsake him, yet he would never do it.
Praesumptio non modo circ^ proprias vires, sed etiam circa divinam potentiam
vel misericordiam, contingere potest. Aquin. 22. qu. 21.1.


presuming upon himself too much: but also by presuming even upon God himself
without warrant. He that repents truly of his sins, presuming of Gods mercy
in the forgiveness thereof; or that walks uprightly and conscionably in the
ways of his calling, presuming of Gods Power for his protection therein;
sins not in so presuming. presumption is a fruit of Faith, and a good
presumption: because it has a sure ground, a double sure ground for failing;
first in the Nature, and then in the Promise of God. As a man may with good
reason presume upon his friend, that he will not be wanting to him in any good
office, that by the just Laws of true friendship one friend ought to do for
another. But, as he presumes too much upon his friend, that cares not into
what desperate exigents and dangers he casts himself, in hope his friend will
perpetually redeem him, and relieve him at every turn: So who ever trusts to
the Mercy, or to the Power of God, without the warrant of a promise, presumes
farther then he has cause: and though he may flatter himself, and call it by
some better name, as Faith, or Hope, or Affiance in God; yet is it in truth no
better then a groundless and a wicked Presumption. Act. 13. -- 16.
Such was the presumption of those Sons of Sceva, who took upon them (but to
their shame and sorrow) to call over them that had evil spirits the name of the
Lord Jesus in a form of adjuration Acts 19. when they had no calling or warrant
from God so to do. And all those men, that going on in a wretched course of
life, do yet hope they shall find mercy at the hour of death: All those that
cast themselves into unnecessary either dangers or temptations, with expectance
that God extraordinary Power in their preservation: All those that promise to
themselves the End without applying themselves to the Means that God has
appointed thereunto; (as to have Learning without Study, Wealth without
Industry, comfort from children without careful education etc.) for as much as
they presume upon Gods help without sufficient warrant, are guilty of the Sin
of Presumption, taken in the former notion, and Materially.

12. But I conceive the Presumptuous sins here in the Text to belong clearly to
the other notion of the word Presumption, taken formally, and as it imports
(not a distinct kind of sin in it self, as that Groundless Presumption whereof
we have hitherto spoken does, but) a common accidental difference, that may
adhere to sins of any kind: even as Ignorance and Infirmity, (whereunto it is
opposed,) also may. Theft and Murder, which are sins of special kinds,
distinguished either from other by their special and proper Objects; are yet
both of them capable of these common differences: in as much as either of them
may be committed, as sometimes through Ignorance, and sometimes through
Infirmity, so also sometimes through wilfulness or Presumption.

13. The distribution of Sins into sins of Ignorance, of Infirmity, and of
Presumption, Aquin. 1.2. qu. 76. etc.
is very usual, and very useful, and complete enough without the addition
(which some make) of a fourth sort, to wit, Sins of Negligence or Inadvertency,
all such sins being easily reducible the Soul of man; wherein there are three
distinct prime faculties, from which all our actions flow: the Understanding,
the Will, and the sensual Appetite or Affections. If nothing were amiss in any
of these, all our actions issuing thence would be perfect, and free from all
stain of sin. But it is a truth, and our misery, that in this state of
corruption the whole soul is out of frame, and all the faculties thereof
depraved. Much Blindness and Error in the Understanding; much Rashness and
Impetuousness in the Affections; much stubbornness and perverseness in the Will:
which renders our whole lives full of Swervings, Weaknesses, and Rebellions.
Yea by reason of the joint concurrence of those three faculties in their
operations: there is in most sinful actions, (especially those that are
completely such) a mixture of Ignorance, Infirmity, and Wilfulness or
Presumption. Whence it is, that all Sins are in the Scriptures indefinitely and
indifferently called, sometimes Errors, sometimes Infirmities, and sometimes
Rebellions.

14. But when we would speak more exactly of these three differences, and so as
to distinguish them one from another by their the Understanding be most in
fault, not apprehending that good it should, or not aright: the sin so done,
though possibly it may have in it somewhat both of Infirmity and Presumption
with all, is yet properly a Sin of Ignorance. 2. If the main fault be in the
affections, through some sudden passion or perturbation of mind; blinding, or
corrupting, or but outrunning the Judgment; as of Fear, Anger, Desire, Joy, or
any of the rest: the Sin thence arising, though perhaps joined with some
Ignorance Presumption withal, is yet properly a sin of Infirmity. 3. But if
the Understanding be competently informed with knowledge, and not much blinded
or transported with the incursion of any sudden, or violence of any vehement
perturbation, so as the greatest blame must remain upon the untowardness of the
Will, resolvedly bent upon the Evil: the Sin arising from such Wilfulness,
though probably not free from all mixture of Ignorance and infirmity withal,
is yet properly a wilful Presumption; such a Presumptuous sin, as we are now
in treaty of.

15. Rules are soonest learned, and best remembered, when Examples. And of such,
the rich storehouse of the Scripture affords us in each kind, variety and
choice enough: whence it shall suffice us to propose but one eminent one of
each sort. The Men, all of them for their holiness, of singular and worthy
renown: David, S. Peter, and S. Paul. The Sins, all of them for their matter,
of the greatest magnitude: Murdering of the innocent, Abnegation of Christ,
Persecution of Paul's persecution, a grievous Sin, yet a Sin of Ignorance,
Peter's denial, a grievous Sin, yet a Sin of Infirmity: David's Murder a far
more grievous sin then either of both, because a sin of Presumption.

16. St Paul before his conversion, whilst he was Saul, persecuted and wasted
the Church of God to the utmost of his power: making havoc of the professors
of Christ, Gal. 1.13.
entering into their very houses, and (...). Chrysostom. ibid. Acts 9 2. and 22, 5.
(...). Acts 26.11.
haling thence to prison both men and women; Acts 8.3.
and posting abroad with letters into remote quarters, to do all the mischief
he could every where, with great fury, as if he had been mad, breathing out
where ever he came nothing but threatenings and slaughter against His Phil. 3.6.
(...). Chrysostom. ubi supra. Acts 26.9.
Affections were not set against them through any personal provocations, but
merely out of zeal to the Law: and surely his zeal had been good, had it not
been blind. Nor did his will run cross to his judgment, but was led by it; for
he verily thought in himself that he ought to do many things contrary to the
Name of Jesus: -- 9.1.
and verily his Will had been good, had it not been misled. But the error was
in his understanding: his judgment being not yet actually convinced of the
truth of the Christian Religion. He was yet fully persuaded that Jesus was an
impostor, and Christianity a pestilent sect raised by Satan to the disgrace and
prejudice Moses and the Law. If these things had indeed been so, as he
apprehended them, his Affections and Will, in seeking to root out such a sect,
had been not only blameless, but commendable. It was his erroneous Judgment
that poisoned all; and made that, which otherwise had been zeal, to become
Persecution. But however, the first discernable obliquity therein being in the
Understanding, that Persecution of his was therefore a Sin of Ignorance: (...).
so called, and under that name condemned by himself, 1 Timothy 1.13.

17. But such was not Peter's denial of his Master. He knew well enough who he
was: having conversed so long with him, and having long before so amply
confessed him. Mat. 16.16.
And he knew also, that he would not do it, because he was abundantly satisfied
that he should not do it. Evident it is then, that Peter wanted no knowledge,
either of his Masters person, or his own duty: and so no plea left him of
Ignorance, either Facti or Iuris. Nor was the fault so much in his Will, as to
make it a sin properly of Presumption. For albeit de facto he did deny him when
he was put to it, Mark 14.71.
and that with fearful oaths and imprecations; yet was it not done with any
prepensed Apostasy or out of design. Yea a contrary resolution: and he still
honored his Master in his heart, even then when he denied him with his tongue:
and as soon as ever the watchword was given him by the second cock, to prefer
to his consideration what he had done, it grieved him sore that he had so done,
-- 72. Luke 22.62.
and he wept bitterly for it. We find no circumstance in the whole relation,
that argues any deep obstinacy Will. But in his Affections then* Alas, there
was the fail. A sudden (...). Chrysostom. in Mat. 26.75.
qualm of fear surprising his soul, when he saw his Master so despightfully
used before his face, (which made him apprehensive of what hard usage himself
might fall under; if he should then and there have owned him) took from him for
that time the benefit and (...). Arist. 5. Ethic. 10.
use of his reason: and so drew all his thoughts to this one point, how to
decline the present danger, that he had never a thought at so much liberty, as
to consult his judgment, whether it were a sin, or no. And thus, proceeding
from such a sudden distemper of passion, Peter's denial was a sin properly of
Infirmity.

David's sin in contriving the death of Vriah, was of a yet higher pitch, and of
a deeper dye, then either of these. 2 Samuel 11. per totum.
He was no such stranger in the Law of God, as not to know that the wilful
murder of an innocent party, such as he also knew Vriah to be, was a most loud
crying sin: and therefore nothing surer, then that it was not merely a sin of
Ignorance. Neither yet was it a sin properly of Infirmity: and so capable of
that extenuating circumstance, of being done in the heat of Anger, as his
uncleanness with Bathsheba was in the heat of Lust, (although that extenuation
will excuse there, unless in tanto only, and as it stands in comparison with
this fouler crime.) But having time and leisure enough to bethink himself what
he was about, he does it in cool blood, and with much advised deliberation:
plotting and contriving this way and that way to perfect his design. He was
resolved, whatsoever should become of it, to have it done: in regard of which
settled resolution of his Will, this sin of David was therefore a high
presumptuous sin.

19. By the light of these Examples we may reasonably discover what a
Presumptuous sin is, and how it is distinguished from Ignorance and Infirmity.
Take the sum of all thus. When a man sufficiently convinced in his
understanding, that the thing he would do was unlawful, and displeasing unto
God; or at least has sufficient means so to convince him, if he be not
willingly wanting to himself in the use thereof, so as he cannot justly plead
Non putaram; And then besides has time and leisure to advise with himself, to
examine the case and every circumstance of it, and to apply the light that is
in his understanding thereunto; And yet when all is done, resolves contrary to
the dictates of his own reason, and the checks of his own conscience, to go on,
to put his wicked intentions his own will, the apparent inconformity thereof
unto the will of God notwithstanding: this is a wilful and a fearful
Presumption. Her speech in the Poet expresses it in part, Medea apud Ovid.
(...) etc. Eurip. in Hippol. act. 2.
-- Video meliora, proboque;
Deteriora sequor --
I see I should do that, and I know I should do better to do that: but I have
a mind rather to this; and therefore I will do this. When we advance our own
Wills, not only against the express will of our great God, but even against the
clear light of our own Consciences; and are not able (nor indeed careful) to
give any other reason why we will do this or that, but only because we will
(pro ratione voluntas;) so making our own will (a piece of no good Logic)
Medium and the Conclusion: we do then rush headlong into those sins, from which
David here prays so earnestly to be withheld [ Keep back thy servant O Lord
from Presumptuous Sins.

20. Now we see what Presumptuous sins are: we are to consider next, how great
and mischievous they are. Certainly if there were not something in them, more
then in other ordinary sins; David would not pray against them in such a
special manner as here we see he does: and that in four particulars.

21. First, because those other sins are quotidianae subreptionis, overtaken
with, through incogitancy, and the frequency of such temptations as lie so
thick in our way every where, (...). Gal. 6.1.
that the most watchful eye cannot always be aware of them all: his prayer
therefore concerning them is, that as he is ever and anon gathering soil by
them, so God would be ever and anon cleansing him from them, [ O cleanse thou
me from my secret faults.] But as for these greater and presumptuous sins, he
desires the powerful aidance of Gods holy spirit to withold him wholly from
them, and to keep him back from ever approaching too near unto them [ Keep back
thy servant from presumptuous sins. As a travellor in a deep his way
throughout, to keep himself as clean as he can from bespotting even with mire
and dirt: but if he spy a rotten bog or a deep precipice just before him; he
will make a sudden stop, hold back, and cast about for a safer way, he will be
sure (for fear of lying fast, or venturing a joint,) to keep out of that
howsoever: So David here; Cleanse me from those, but kep me back from these.

22. Secondly, in his petition he makes mention of his service and dependence.
He often professes himself the servant of God, Truly I am thy servant, I am
thy servant, and the son of thy Psalm. 116.16.
And he often remembers it to good purpose, and presses it for his advantage,
upon sundry occasions in this book of Psalms: as he does here very seasonably
and pertinently, [ keep back thy servant -- ] Impl^ying, that these
Presumptuous are more unbecoming the servant of God, and more unpardonable in
him, then those other faults are. As a discreet Master will pass by many
oversights in his servant, if sometimes for want of wit; and some negligences
too, if happily for want of care, he do now and then otherwise then he would
have him. But it would exceedingly provoke the spirit of the most suffering
Master, to see his servant, though but once, to do that which he knew would
offend him in a kind of bravery, and out of a saucy and Idem delictum in
duobus non eodem modo afficiet: si alter per negligentiam admisit, alter
curavit ut nocens esset. Senec. l. de ira. 16.
self-willed Presumption: (as who say, I know it will anger my Master, but all
is one for that; I will do it tho:) no Patience would endure this. So the
servant of God, by one presumptuous sin does more grieve and the holy spirit of
his gracious Master, and more highly provoke his just indignation, then by many
Ignorances or Negligences.

23. Thirdly, he speaks here of Dominion, [ Let them not have the Dominion
over me.] Any small sin, may get the upper-hand of the sinner, and bring him
under in time, and after that it is once habituated by long custom: so as he
cannot easily shake off the yoke, neither redeem himself from under the tyranny
thereof. We see the experiment of it but too often and too evidently in our
common Swearers and Drunkards. Yet do such kind of sins for the the throne
insensibly, and do not exercise Dominion over the enslaved soul, till they
have got strength by many and multiplied Acts. But a Presumptuous sin works a
great alteration in the state of the soul at once, and by one single act
advances marvellously: weakening the spirit, and giving a mighty advantage to
the flesh, even to the hazard of a complete Conquest.

24. Lastly, he speaks of the great offense: Total and Final Apostasy; which
some understand to be the very sin against the Holy Ghost: which cutteth off
from the offender all possibility of pardon reconcilement, because it is
supposed to be attended with final impenitency; and without penance there is
no hope of reconcilement, or place for pardon. David petitioneth to be kept
back from these Presumptuous sins, and free from their Dominion, that so he
might be upright and innocent from the great transgression. As if these
Presumptuous sins did make some nearer approaches to that great transgression:
and as if no man could well secure himself against the danger of final
impenitencie, but by keeping out of the reach of these Presumptuous sins.

15. From all these intimations in the Text we may conclude, Presumptuous sins,
then in sins of Ignorance and Infirmity: the Obliquity greater, and the Danger
greater. Which we are now a little farther to discover, that so our care to
avoid them may be the greater. Their Obliquity is best seen in the Cause: their
Danger, in the Effects. It has been cleared already, that Presumptuous sins
spring from the perverseness of the Will, Immediate cause: and it is the Will,
that has the chief stroke in all moral actions, to render them good or bad,
better or worse. It is a Maxim among the Casuists, Involuntarium minuit de
ratione peccati: l. qui injuriae. F. de surtis. 47.253.
and Voluntas distinguit maleficia, say the Lawyers. So that albeit there be
many circumstances, as of Time, Place, Persons, etc. and sundry other respects,
especially those of the Matter, and of the End, very considerable for the
aggravating, extenuationg, and comparing of sins one with another: yet the
consent of the Will is of so much greater importance then all the rest, that
(all other considerations laid aside) every sin is absolutely by so much
greater or lesser, by how much it is more or less voluntary. Ignorance and
Infirmity there is less Wilfulness; the will being misled in the one by an
Error in the Judgment, and in the other transported by the violence of some
Passion: and in sins of Presumption there is a greater wilfulness; wherein the
will, wanting neither information nor leisure to resolve better, does yet
knowingly and advisedly resolve to do ill: it will necessarily follow, that
Presumptuous sins are therefore far greater sins, then either of the other are.
The Will being abundantly and beyond measure wilful, makes the sin to be
abundantly and beyond measure sinful. Doubtless far greater was David's sin, in
murdering servant: then either Peter's, in denying his Master; or Saul's, in
blaspheming and persecuting his Savior.

26. Nor only do Presumptuous Sins spring from a worse Cause then the other,
and thence are more Sinful: but do also produce worse Effects then they, and so
are more Dangerous. Whether we look at them before, or at the time of
Repentance, or after. Before Repentance, they harden the heart wonderfully;
they waste the conscience in a fearful manner, and bring such a callous crust
upon the inner man: that it will be Tardius peccatum solvitur, quod per
consilium solidatur. Gregor. de cura pastor. part. 3.
a long and a hard work, so to supple, Repentance. For alas! what hope to do
good upon a Wilful man? The most grave admonitions, the most seasonable
reproofs, the most powerful exhortations, the most convincing Reasons that can
be used to such a man; are but Tabula caeco, as a curious picture to a blind
man; (for who so blind, as he that will not see?) and Fabula surdo, a pleasant
tale to a deaf man; (for whosoever deaf as he that will not hear?)

27. Thus it is with wicked men and cast-aways, whose brawny hearts are by
these wilful rebellions fitted for, and fatted up unto destruction. Gods
faithful servants for the time; if at any time they hap to fall into any
presumptuous sin. In what a sad condition may we think poor David was, after he
had layen with the wife, and slain the husband? Anthems? with what comfort
could he say his Prayers? Did not his tongue, think ye, cleave to the roof of
his mouth? and had not his right hand welnigh forget her cunning? To the
judgment of man, no difference for some months together (during his
unrepentance) betwixt holy David, the man after Gods own heart, and a profane
scorner, that had no fear of God before his eyes. Such waste and havoc had
that great sin made, and such spoil of the graces and pledges of Gods holy
Spirit in his soul. Look how a sober wise man, who when he is himself is able
to order his words and affairs blood is inflamed, and his brain distempered,
will rave, and talk at random, and fling stones and dirt at all about him,
and every other way in his speeches and motions, behave himself like a fool or
madman: so is the servant of God, lying under the guilt of a Presumptuous sin,
before Repentance.

28. And then when he does come to repent; Lord what ado there is with him,
before that great stomach of his will come down, and his masterful spirit be
soundly subdued! And yet down it must, subdued it must be; or he gets no
pardon. What shrinking searched? And yet Alto vulneri diligens and longa
medicina non desit. Cyprian sermon. 5. de lapsis. -- (...). Nazianz. Ar^an. carm.
8.
searched it must be, and probed to the bottom; or there will be no perfect
recovery. Presumptuous sins, being so grievous as has been showed, let no man
think they will be removed with Esaias 1.18. 2 Cor. 7.11.
mean and ordinary Humiliations: The Remedy must be proportioned, both for
strength and quantity, ( Ingredients and Dose) to the Quality and Malignity of
the distemper; or it will never do the cure. As stains of a deep dye will not
out of the cloth, with such ordinary washings, as will fetch out lighter
spots: so to cleanse the heart defiled with these deeper pollutions, these
crimson and and to restore it pure white as snow or wool; a more solemn and
lasting course is requisite, then for lesser transgressions. It will Quam magna
deliquimus, ^am granditer desleamus. Cyprian. ibid.
ask more sighs, more tears, more indignation, more revenge; a stronger
infusion of all those sovereign ingredients prescribed by St Paul 2 Cor. 7.
before there can be any comfortable hope that it is pardoned. The Will of a man
is a sour and stubborn piece of clay, that will not frame to any serviceable
use, without much working. A soft and tender heart indeed is soon rent in
pieces: like a silken garment, if it do but catch upon any little nail. But a
heart hardened with long custom of sinning, especially presumptuous sins, is
like the knotty root-end of an old Oak, that has layen long a drying in the
sun. It must be -- duro nodo durus cuneus. Adag.

-- gravissimus nodus non potest expelli nisi gravissimo oppressorio. Ambros.


a hard wedg that will enter, and it must be handled with some skill too to
make it do that: and when the wedg is entered, it will endure many a hard knock,
before it will yield to the cleaver, and fall in sunder. And indeed it is a
blessed thing, and to be acknowledged a gracious evidence of Gods unspeakable
mercy, to wilfully suffered such an unclean spirit to enter in, and to take
possession of their souls, if they shall ever be enabled to out him again,
though with never so much fasting and Prayer. Potentes potenter, they that have
mightily offended, shall be sure to be mightily tormented, if they repent not:
and therefore it is but reason they should be mightily humbled, when they do
repent.

29. After Repentance also, Presumptuous sins for the most part have their
uncomfortable Effects. Very seldom has any man taken the liberty to sin
presumptuously; but he has after met with that which has been grievous to
him: either in outward things, good name, or in his soul; in some or other of
these, if not in all, even after the renewing of himself by repentance, and the
sealing of his pardon from God. Like a grievous wound or sore, that is not only
of a hard cure, but leaves also some remembrance behind it, some scarr in the
flesh after it is cured.

30. First, a Presumptuous Sinner rarely escapes without some notable outward
Affliction. Not properly as a debt payable to the Justice of God by way of
satisfaction: for there is no proportion between the one and the other. But
partly, as an evidence of Gods high displeasure against such a high
provocation; and partly as a fit chastisement, wherewith he is pleased in mercy
to correct his servants presumptuosly: that both they and others may be
admonished by that example to do so no more. Be David the instance. What a
world of mischief and misery did he create unto himself by that one
presumptuous fact in the matter of Uriah, almost all the days of his life
after? The Prophet Nathan at the very same time, when he delivered him Gods
royal and gracious pardon for it, under seal ( Transtulit peccatum, 2 Samuel
12.13.
the Lord has put away thy sin:) yet did he withal read him the bitter
consequents of it; as you have them set down 2 Samuel 12. And as he foretold him,
accordingly it fell out with him. His daughter defiled by her brother: 2 Samuel
13.14. -- 29.
that brother slain by another brother: a strong conspiracy raised against him
by his own son: his Concubines openly defiled by the same son: 2 Samuel 15.12. --
16.22. -- 18.33. 2 Samuel 16.5. etc.
himself afflicted with the untimely and uncomfortable death of that son, who
was his darling: reviled and cursed to his face by a base unworthy companion:
besides many other affronts, troubles, and vexations continually. He had few
quiet hours all his life long: and even upon his deathb-ed not a little
disquieted with tidings of his two sons, almost up in arms about the
succession. 1 King. 1.17. etc.
We use to say, The wilful man never wants woe: and truly David felt it by
sad experience, woe his wilfulness wrought him.

31. Secondly, Presumptuous sins are often Scandalous; leaving an indeleble
stain and blot upon the name and memory of the guilty offender; not to be wholly
wiped off, so long as that name David must be our instance here too: who sinned
many other times and ways, besides that in the matter of Vriah. It can be
little pleasure to us to rove into the infirmities of Gods servants, and bring
them upon the stage: it would perhaps become our charity better to cast a
mantle over their nakedness, where the fact will with any tolerable
construction bear an excuse Yet since all things that are written are written
for our learning, and that it pleased the wisdom of God, Romans 15.4.
for that end to leave so many of their failings upon record, as glasses to
represent unto us our common frailties, and as monuments and marks to mind us
of those rocks whereat others have ship-wrackt: it His diffidence then, and
anxiety, 1 Samuel 27.1. 1 Samuel 21.12. and 27.10. and 28.8. 1 Samuel 25.22.
lest he should perish one day by the hands of Saul, when he had Gods promise
that he should outlive him. His deep dissimulation with and before Achis;
especially when he tendered his service to him in the wars. His rash choleric
vow to destroy Nabal and all that belonged to him; who had indeed played the
churl and the wretch with him (as covetous and unthankful men sometimes will
do,) but yet in rigore had done him no Mephibosheth (and therein also his
forgetfulness of his old and trusty friend Jonathan) first, in giving away all
his lands upon the bare suggestion of a servant, 2 Samuel 16.4.
and that to the false informer himself, and that without any examination at
all of the matter; and then, -- 19.29. -- 18.5.33.
in restoring him but half again, when he knew the suggestion to be false. His
fond affection to his ungracious son Absalom; in tendering his life before his
own safety and the public good, and in taking his death with so much unmanly
impatience. His lenity and indulgence to his other son Adonijah, who was no
better then he should be neither; to Eli did to his sons, 1 King. 1.6. 2 Samuel
24.1. etc.
why have thou done so? His carnal confidence in the multitude of his
subjects, when he caused them to be numbered by the pole. These (and perhaps
some other) sinful oversights, which do not presently occur to my memory, are
registered of David, as well as the murder of Vriah. Yet as if all these were
as nothing in comparison of that one: that one alone is put in by the holy
Ghost by way of exception, and so inserted as an exception in that glorious
testimony, which we find given of him ^. King. 15.5. [ David did that which
was right in the eyes of the Lord, and turned not aside from ] That is, he
turned not aside so foulely, and so contemptuously, so presumptuously and so
provokingly in any other thing, as he did in that business of Vriah. All his
Ignorances, and Negligences, and Inconsiderations, and Infirmities are passed
over in silence: only this great Presumptuous Sin stands up as a pillar or
monument erected ad perpetuam rei memoriam, warning and example by.

32. Yet were this more tolerable, if besides a Stain in the Name, these
Presumptuous sins did not also leave a Sting in the Conscience of the sinner:
which abides in him many times a long while after the sin is repented of and
pardoned; ready upon every occasion to smite him and to gall him with some
touch and remorse of his old presumption. Like as a man, that having gotten
some sore bruise in his youth, and by the help of Surgery and the strength of
youth overworn it; may yet carry a grudging of it in his grudgings of an old
bruise are aptest to recur upon some new distemper of body, or upon change of
weather: so the grief of an old presumptuous sin is commonly most felt, upon
the committing of some new sin, or the approach of some new affliction. Do you
think David had not in all those afflictions that after befell him, and at the
apprehension of every sinful oversight into which he fell, a fresh remembrance
withal of the matter of Vriah, not without some grief and shame thereat? As
the distress Joseph's brethren met with in Egypt Genesis 42. brought to their
remembrance their Genesis 42.21-22 V. Jacob. Armach. Annals a. m. 2276. -- 2315.
-- 50.15 -- 17.
which was (by probable computation) at the least twenty years after the thing
was done. Yea and after their fathers death, (which by the like probable
computation was near upon twenty years more) the remorse of the same sin
wrought upon their consciences afresh, perplexing their hearts with new fears
and jealousies. True it is, the sinner once thoroughly purged of the sin by
repentance, has no more conscience of that sin, in that fearful degree
(ordinarily) as to be a perpetual rack to his soul, and to torment him with
restless doubtings of his reconcilement even to despair: yet can it not choose
but put some affrightment into him, to remember into what a desperate estate he
had before plunged himself by his own wilful disobedience, if God had not been
infinitely gracious to him therein. Great presumptions will not suffer him that
has repented them, for ever quite to forget them: and he shall never be able
to remember them, without shame and horror.

33. Great cause then had David to pray so earnestly (as we see here he does)
against them; and as great cause have the best of us to use our best care and
endeavor to avoid them: being they spring from such cursed root, and are both
so grievous to the holy bitter consequents to the guilty offender. Our next
business will be, (the sin and danger being so great) to learn what is best to
be done on our part, for the avoiding and preventing both of sin and danger.
Now the means of prevention (our third Discovery) are, First to seek help from
the hand of God, by David here that the Lord would keep us back; and then to
put to our own helping hand, by seconding our prayers with our best endeavors,
to keep our selves back, from these presumptuous sins.

34. A Jove Principium. We have no stay, nor command of our selves; (so
masterful are our Wills, and headstrong:) but that, if God should leave us
wholly to the wildness of our unruly nature, and to take our own course, we
should soon run our selves upon our own ruin. Psalm. 32.9.
Like unto the horse and mule that have no understanding, to guide themselves
in a right and safe way; but they must be holden in with bit and bridle put
into their do or find mischief. If we be not kept back with strong hand (and
no other hand but the hand of God is strong enough to keep us back:) we shall
soon run into all extremities of evil with the greatest impetuousness that can
be, as the horse rusheth into the battle; Jerem. 8.6. 1 Pet. 4.4. Ephesians. 4.19.
running into every excess of riot as fast as any temptation is set before us,
and committing all manner of wickedness with all kind of greediness. David
knew it full well; and therefore durst not trust his own heart too far: but
being jealous over himself with a Godly jealousy, evermore he made God his
refuge. If at any time he had been kept back from sinning, when some
opportunity did seem to tempt or provoke him thereunto; blessed God for it: for
he saw it was Gods doing, more then his own ( Blessed be the Lord, 1 Samuel 25
32. -- 34.
that has kept his servant from evil) in the the case of Nabal, 1 Samuel 25. If
at any time he desired to be kept back from sinning, when Satan had laid a bait
for him without, suitable to some lust stirring within; he sought to God for it:
for he knew that he must do it; himself could not, ( keep back thy servant also
from presumptuous sins) here in the Text. Without his help and blessing all
endeavors are in vain: his help and blessing therefore must be sought for in
the first place by Prayer.

35. But we may not think, when we have so done, that we Gods blessing, I
confess, that does the deed; not our endeavors: but we are vain, if we expect
Gods blessing, without doing our endeavors. Can we be so senseless as to
imagine it should serve our turn to say, Lord keep us back: and yet our selves
in the mean time thrust forward as fast as we can? No: if we will have our
prayers effectual, (and in their efficacy is our chiefest hope and comfort;) we
must second our faithful prayers with our faithful endeavors. Oculus ad
coelum; manus ad clavum. Then may we with confidence expect, that God should do
his part in keeping when we are duly careful to do our part also toward the
keeping our selves back from presumptuous sins. -- (...). 1 John 5.18.
Against which sins, the best and most sovereign preservatives, I am yet able
to prescribe, are these four following. It is every man's concernment: and
therefore I hope it shall be without offense, if after the example of God
himself in delivering the Law, I speak to every in particular.

36. For the avoiding then of Presumptuous sins: First, be sure never to do
any thing against the clear light of thine own Conscience. Every known sin has
a spice of wilfulness and presumption in it. The very composure of David's
Prayer in the present passage implies as much; in passing immediately, after
the mention of his secret and unknown sins, to the mentioning of these
presumptuous Sins: as if there were scarce any medium at all between them. And
every sin against conscience is a known sin. A man has not a heavier Foe then
his own Conscience, after he has sinned; nor before he sin, a faster Friend. O
take heed of losing such a Friend: or of making it, of a Friend, an Accuser. If
I should see one that I loved well fall into the company of a cheater, or other
crafty companion, that would be sure to inveigle him in some ill bargain, or
draw him into some hurtful inconvenience, if he should close with him, of whom
yet he had no suspicion: I should but do the part of a Friend to take him
aside, tell him who had him in hand, and bid him look well to himself, and
beware a cheat. But if he should after such warning given grow into farther
fammiliarity signs one after another, to break off speech, and to quit the
company of such a dangerous fellow, and all to no purpose: Who could either
pity him, or blame me, if I should leave him at last to be gulled and fooled,
that set so little by (...). Homer. Ilia. (...).
the wholesome and timely admonitions of his friend? Much greater then his is
thy folly, if thou O te miserum, si contemnis hunc testem. Senec. Epist. 43.
neglectest the warnings, and despisest the murmurings of thine own Conscience.
Thou suffer it but deservedly, if thy Conscience having so ofen warned thee
in vain, at length grow weary of that office, and leave thee to take thine own
course; and so thou become a prey to the Quis enim invitum servare laboret?
Hor. 1. Ep. 20.
Be careful not to grieve thine own spirit by offending thy Conscience: and
thou shall not lightly grieve the spirit of God by sinning Presumptuously. Ephesians.
4.30.


37. Secondly, strive to be Master of thine own will. We count our horses
unserviceable till they be broken: and the more headstrong, the more
unserviceable: And it is a point of the greatest skill in the art of Education,
for Parents betimes to break their children of their wills. If David had done
so with his Absolon, and his Adoniah; for ought we know, he might have had more
own soul, as a discreet father would do over his child? and be as careful to
break thy self of thine own will; as he his child, of his? And to get the
mastery over thy self in greater matters, it will behove thee to exercise this
discipline skillful Wood-man, will exercise himself thereunto first by shooting
sometimes at a dead mark. In thy meats and drinks, in thy pastimes and society,
in other delights and things, such as are in themselves both lawful and
honest; exercise this sovereignty now and then over thine own will. When thou
observest it eagerly bent upon some one thing, (that may without sin or folly
be left undone;) sometimes deny thy self and thine own will therein; curb thy
desires, though they be somewhat importunate: and thou shall find in time
incredible benefit by it. There are some other, but this is one of the best
uses of Fasting, and (to my seeming) the most proper and immediate Flesh, and
take down the body (though that also) as to cross the appetite, and pull down
the Will. That proverbial form of afflicting the soul, usual among the
Hebrews, Esaias 58.5. Prove. 23.2. 1 Cor. 9.27.
and that peculiar to Solomon of putting a knife to the throat, do both look
this way. And so does S. Paul's (...) 1 Cor. 9. which is an athletique pugilar
word: as those that beat one another with their fists, striving for the
mastery; -- 25. 1 Cor. 7.37. Knolles.
so did he to bring his body in subjection, that so he might have (as the
phrase is otherwhere in the same Epistle) (...), power over his own will.

Amurath the great Turk, in cutting off with his own hands the head of his
beautiful minion Irene, upon no dislike at all; but merely that his Princes
(who were displeased to see his mind, by doting upon her, drawn off from all
care of the public affairs,) might withal see, how he could command himself,
and conquer his own affections. But we need not seek out so far for an example:
having one more innocent, and of a far better man then he in the scriptures;
even our David. Who longing with an earnest appetite to drink of the water of
the well by the gate of Bethlehem: 2 Sa. 23.15.16.
yet his Worthies, he would not taste a drop of it, but (in condemnation of the
inordinacy of his appetite, which had exposed such worthy persons to the hazard
of their lives,) poured it out unto the Lord. What a mass of Sin and misery had
he escaped could he have so denied himself in the matter of Vriah. Verily,
there is no conquest like this, for a man to conquer himself: and he that has
Quem magis admiraberis, quam qui imperat sibi, quam qui se habet in potestate?
Gentes facilius est barbaras* etc. Senec. 5. de benef. 7. Prove. 16.32. 2 Timothy
2.26.
subdued his own will, has done a braver thing, then he that has taken a
town, or scaled the walls of a Castle. It is wilfulness only, that begets
Presumption: the more therefore thou can master thine own the safer thou art
from sinning Presumptuously. That is the second.

39. Thirdly, beware of engaging thy self to sin. It is a fearful thing, when
sin has got a tie upon a man. Then is one properly in the snare of the Devil;
when he has him as it were in a string, and may lead him captive to what
measure of presumption he will. And sundry ways may a man thus entangle
himself: by a Verbal, Real, by a Sinful Engagement. He shall do best to keep
himself out of all these snares. But if once he be in; there is no way out
again but one: even this, To loose his pledge, to break in sunder the bonds
wherein he is tied, Judges 16.9.
as Sampson did the green withs, and to cast away those cords from him.

40. A man has bound himself rashly by some promise, vow, or covenant, to do
something he may not do, or not to do something he ought to do. He is now
engaged in a sin: the Devil has got this tie upon him. And though his
conscience tell him he cannot proceed without sin; yet because of his Vow, or
his Oath, he wilful, and must on. It was Herod's Case; for taking off the
Baptists head. It was against his conscience to do it: for he knew he had not
deserved it: Ey, and it was against his mind too to do it; Mark 6.20. -- 26.
for the Text says, he was exceeding sorry that his niece should put him upon
it. But yet, says the story withal, for his oath sake, and because the great
ones about him should not say but the King would be as big as his word, he
resolved it should be done, and gave commandment accordingly to have it done.
This I call a Verbal Engagement.

41. There is a Real one too, as ill as this. For example. A man hears of a
bargain which he apprehends will be for his profit; or spieth out a likely
way for his advancement: and being moneys, or puts his great friends upon
it, to further his design. It may be afterward upon better consideration, he
espieth a flaw in it, which he saw not before: or some intervening accident,
which he could not probably foresee, has cast such a rub in his way, that he
cannot go on fairly, as at first he hoped, but he must strain his conscience a
little to remove that rub. This he knows he should not do: but alas, he is
now engaged. The Devil has this tie upon him; It would not be for his ease to
lose so much money, as he is out of purse already in the adventure: And he
shall hazard the great friends hereafter, if having put them upon a business,
he should now relinquish it: And so he resolves to go on. It was Amaziah's
Case in part, when to aid him against the Edomites he had hired a hundred
thousand men of Israel for an hundred talents of silver. 2 Chronicles. 25.6.
A Prophet comes to him, and tells him it was the Lords pleasure he should
dismiss the Soldiers he had hired; for God would not be with them: and if he
did employ them, he should not prosper. The King was troubled at it not a
little. He might fear lest the cashiered soldiers should do him some
displeasure as they returned back: and so they did, and that a shrewd
displeasure too. But -- 13.
was the moneys he was out, ( What shall we do, -- 9.
says he, for the hundred talents, which I have given to the army of Israel.)
He thought it went hard, to part with such a round sum for nothing. Indeed the
Prophet put him into the right way; even who was able to give him much more
then that. And the King did very well and wisely, to hearken to the counsel of
the Prophet, and to be content to sit down with the loss: And so he came well
off at the last, though he was dangerously engaged onward.

42. Besides that verbal, and this Real; there is yet a third, which I call a
sinful Engagement, (because it is such originally, and a principio; for the two
former also are sinful a termino, and in the Event:) far worse then either of
both. And that is, when a man has already done some evil, from which he
cannot handsomely loss or shame, or other punishment; unless he either cover it
or maintain it, or some other way help himself, by laying Scelera sceleribus
^uenda sunt Senec. 1. de clem. 13.
another sin upon it, as untoward children and naughty servants are wont, when
they have done a fault, and yet would shun the blame, to shift it off with a
lie. This is Quid eo infelicius, cui jam esse malo necesse est? Ibid.
the most dangerous tie of all other: and there is nothing that so desperately
casts a man upon a wilful resolution of sinning; as when the committing of
one Sin brings with it a seeming necessity of doing another. This makes men,
like the Giants in the Poets, imponere Pelion Ossae, to heap sin upon sin, to
pile up transgressions thirst to drunkenness. Esaias. 30.1. Deuteronomy. 29.19.
It was David's very case in the matter of Uriah. He had never proceeded to such
black thoughts, as to plot the murder, of a person so worthy and so innocent in
so base a manner, and with so much palpable hypocrisy; had he not been deeply
engaged before by another dishonest act already by him committed. He had layen
with the wife: she proving with child, and all his other shifts, whereby he
had attempted to cloak it, taking no effect, the thing was like to come to
public knowledge to his everlasting disgrace, if not also to the great
reproach of Religion. No way now to help it, but to take the out of the way,
and to marry the widow. He resolves upon it therefore: (...). Eurip. Hecuba
act. 4.
so it must be, come what will come on it. Iacta est alea: David was already
in, and now no remedy but he must on.

43. These be fearful things. Therefore as wary men in the world love to keep
themselves out of bonds; so do thou beware of these Engagements. Seldom does a
man fall into a Presumptuous Sin, but where the Devil has got such a hanke
over him, as one of these three, I have now mentioned. But he that has
suffered himself to be thus ensnared, has this only way left for his escape,
even to disengage himself out of hand, by breaking through the snare, if he
cannot fairly unty it: ^s Alexander cut the great knot in pieces with his
sword, which he could else never have unloosed* ^now that neither Oath, Vow,
Curt. lib. 3.
nor other tie whatsoever is allowed by almighty God to be Vinculum
iniquitatis, to bind thee to any sinful inconvenience. Whatsoever seeming
necessity there is of doing evil; consider it grows but by a later contract:
but God is able to plead a precontract; by virtue whereof there lies upon thee
an absolute necessity of Obedience. Oppose rash promises and vows, that solemn
promise and vow, thou made unto God in the face of the Congregation, and
tookest the holy Sacrament upon it in thy baptism, to keep his holy
Commandments, and to continue his faithful servant and soldier unto thy lives
end. Let Equity teach thee, that the first bond should be first discharged: and
Reason, that if an Oath or Vow must stand, the first should rathest. That is
the Third preservative.

44. Lastly and in a word: Obdura, Harden thy self with a holy obstinacy and
wilfulness; and Obtura, Stop thy ears, like the deaf adder; against all the
enchantments of Satan and his Sin. It is Solomon's receipt, and a sure one;
Prove. 1.10.
no antidote like it: My Son, if Sinners entise thee; consent thou not. Yet
even from these Sinners thou may learn this point of Wisdom: behold how
resolute and wilful they are in their courses. Dissuade them therefrom with
the best art you can devise: they will, it may be, give you the hearing;
perhaps confess you speak reason. But they hold the Conclusion still, in
despite of all Premises: when you have said what you can, they will do what
they list. Why can not thou be as obstinately good, as they are obstinately
evil? and notwithstanding all the sophisms of Satan, carnal Reason, allurements
or discouragements in the world, say and hold; that thou will not for all that
depart from the obedience of thy Maker. Psalm. 119.115.
Away from me ye wicked, for I will keep the Commandments of my God; says
David, Psalm. 119. As if he had said, Talk no more of it; save your breath; I am
resolved of my course, I have sworn and am steadfastly purposed to keep the
Commandments of my God: -- 106.
with Gods help there will I hold me, and all the world shall not wrest me from
it.

45. The Devil is an arrand Sophister; and will not take an answer, though
never so reasonable and satisfactory, but will ever reply. So long as we hold
us but to Ob. and Sol. to argument and answer; he will never out: but wrangle
in infinitum. You may see it in Mat. 4. how ready he was with his Replies, even
upon our blessed Savior himself; and that with Scriptum est too: Matthew. 4.6.
as if he meant to drop quotations with him. But as there Christ's (...) Avoid

produced: so the safest way for us to come off clear from him, is to give him a
flat denial without further reason, and let him take that for an answer, if he
will any. Thus to be Wilful, is a blessed Wilfulness; a wilful Presumption.

resolved and endeavored what we can; unless (...). Eurip. Supplic. Act. ^.
the Lord be pleased to set his Fiat unto it, and to confirm it with his royal
assent, all our labor is but lost. As he is the Alpha, so is he to be the
Omega too: and therefore we must set him at both ends. And as we were to begin
with him, so are we to conclude with him: pray first, pray last: Pray before
all, that we may have grace to do our Endeavors; Pray after all, that he would
give a blessing to our endeavors. That so when Satan, the World, and our own
Flesh shall all conspire against us to drive us forward to the works of sin, we
grace and blessing be kept back therefrom, and enabled to persevere in true
faith and holiness all the days of our lives. Which God our heavenly Father
grant us for his mercies sake, and for the merits of Jesus Christ his only son
our Lord: to both whom with the Holy Ghost, etc.

AD AULAM. Sermon V.
GREENWICH JULY 1637.
Philip. 4.11. Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned in
whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.


1. SAint Paul found much kinndesse from these Philippians; and took much
comfort in it: And because it was more then ordinary, and beyond the kindness
of other Churches, he does therefore sometimes remember it, with much
thankfulness both to God and them. Even in the beginning of the Gospel, that
is, presently after Verse. 15.
(the story whereof is laid down Acts 16.) when having passed through
Amphipolis and Apollonia, he came and preached at Thessalonica, Act. 16.1.
which was another principal City of Macedonia: these Philippians, hearing
belike that the Apostle had little other means for his maintenance there, then
what he got by his hand-labour, (wherein both for examples sake, not be
chargable to the Thessalonians, 2 These 3 7.9. -- 8.
he employed himself diligently both day and night;) they sent over, and so did
no other Church but they, verse. 15.16.
and that once and again, to supply his necessities there.

2. And as they began, it seems they continued: to show forth the truth of
their Faith, and to adorn their Christian profession, by their cheerfulness and
liberality, in contributing to the necessities of their brethren upon every
good occasion. For at Corinth also the year following, where for the space of a
year and half together he did for good considerations forbear (as he had before
Thessalonica) to challenge that maintenance from the people which by Gods
ordinance he had a right unto: Act. ^8.11. 1 C^r 9.12 15.
-- 14. 2 Cor. 11.9. -- 8.
the supplies he had, he acknowledges to have come from these brethren of
Macedonia; As if he had even robbed the Philippians (it is his own word,) in
taking wages of them for the service done to other Churches.

3. Not to speak of their great bounty some three or four years after that,
Romans 15.26. 2 Cor. 8.3.
toward the relief of the poor brethren that dwelt in Judea; wherein they
were willing of themselves without any great solicitation, and liberal (not
only to the utmost of, but) even somewhat beyond their power: Now also again,
after some three S. Paul being in durance at Rome, their former charitable care
over him (which had not of a good while shown it self forth for lack of
opportunity) began to re-flourish, (...) ver. 10.
and to put forth with a fresh verdure, as a tree does at the approach of
Summer. For they sent him a large benevolence to Rome by Epaphroditus, -- 18.
of the receipt whereof he now certifieth them by the same Epaphroditus at his
return; expressing the great joy and comfort he took in those gracious
evidences of their pious affections, to the Gospel first, and then to him. He
highly commends their Charity in it: -- 18. -- 19.
and he earnestly beseeches God to reward them for it.

4. Yet lest this just commendation of their beneficence, should through any
man's uncharitableness (whereunto corrupt nature is too prone,) raise an unjust
opinion of him, as if he sought theirs more then them, 2 Cor. 12.16. -- 18.
or being crafty had caught them with guile, to make a prey or a gain of them;
so sinisterly interpreting his extolling of their charity for the time past, as
if it were but an artificial kind of begging for the time to come: He thought
it needful for him by way of Prolepsis to prevent whatsoever might be surmised
in that kind, which he begins to do in the words of the Text, to

5. True it is, nor will I dissemble it, when I received from Epaphroditus the
things that were sent from you: it was no small rejoicing to my heart, ver. 10.
-- 19.
to see your care of me (after some years intermission) to flourish again: And
I cannot but give an Euge to your you have done well to communicate with my
afflictions. Yea I should derogate from the grace of God, which he has
bestowed upon you and works in you; if I should not both acknowledge your
free benevolence toward me, and approve it as an odor of a sweet smell, a
sacrifice acceptable and well-pleasing to God. Which I speak not out of a
greedy mind to make a gain of you, nor for a cloak of covetousness (God is my
witness,) nor any other way so much in reference to my own private interest, as
for the glory of God, and to the comfort of your consciences. In as much as
this fruit of your Faith thus working by Love, does redound to the honor of
the ^ospel in the mean time, and shall in abound to your account ^n the day of
the Lord Jesus. Otherwise as to my own particular, alt^ough my wants were
supplied, and my bowels refreshed through your liberality, (which, in the
condition I was in, was some comfort to me:) yet if that had been all I had
looked after; the want of the things you sent me, could not have much afflicted
me. The Lord whom I serve is God All-sufficient: and his grace had been
sufficient for me, though your supplies had never come. He that enableth me,
(howsoever of my self unable to do any thing, yet) to do all things through
Christ that strengthens me, has framed my heart by his holy spirit, and
Experience and Afflictions; to rest my self contented with his alotment
whatsoever it be, and to have a sufficiency within my self, though in never so
great a deficiency of outward things. [ Not that I speak in respect of want:
for I have learned in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.]

6. The words contain a Protestation, and the reason of it. First, because his
commendation of their Charity to him might be obnoxious to mis-construction, as
if he had some low covetous end therein: to prevent all evil suspicion that
way, he disavoweth it utterly by protesting the contrary, in the former part of
the verse, Not that I speak in respect of want.] And then to make that
Protestation the more credible, he assigns as the Reason thereof the
Contentedness of his mind [ For I have learned, says he, in whatsoever state
I am, therewith to be content. Concerning which Contentedness, in the later
part of the verse, he gives a touch what a manner of thing it was; and withal
acquainteth us how he came by it: giving us some hint, in that, of the Nature;
in this, of the Art, of true Contentment. Which are the two things indeed
mainly to be insisted upon from the Text. Yet would not the Protestation be
wholly slipped over: since from it also may be deduced sundry profitable
Inferences. Some of which I shall first mind you of, with convenient brevity:
and then pass on to the main. (...). Not that I speak in respect of want.

7. Hence learn first, what a base and unworthy thing it is: indeed for any
man; for a Christian man much more; most of all for a Churchman, to be
covetously minded. Would our Apostle be the suspicion, if the crime it self
were any whit tolerable? Nor does he it here only; but upon every needful
occasion otherwhere also, using the like preventions and protestations. To the
Ephesians: I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, Acts 20.33. 1 Cor. 9.15. 2
Cor. 12.14. 1 These. 2.5.
or aparel. To the Corinthians: I have not written these things, that it should
be so done to me. I was not, neit^er will I be burdensome to you, for I seek
not yours, but you. To the Thessalonians: Neither at any time used we a cloak
of covetousness, God is witness. He calls God in to be his compurgator: which
sure he would not do, nisi dignus vindice nodus; if it did not much concern him
to stand cloak of covetousness too: for who indeed shameth not to wear it
outwardly? No man will profess himself covetous, be he never so wretchedly
sordid within: but he will for very shame cast as handsome a cloak as he can
over it ( Nec dubie tanquam frugi laudatur avarus. Juvenal. Satyr. 14.
Frugality, good Husbandry, Providence, some cloak or other) to hide the
filthiness of it from the sight of other. But filthy it is still; be it cloaked
never so honestly. Still God abhors it, as a filthy thing: [ He speaks
well of the covetous, Psalm. 10.3.
whom God abhors.] To it in a more peculiar manner has the very name of
Sordidness been appropriated of old, and still is in every man's mouth. Our
Apostle has set a brand of Filthiness upon it more then once ((...)) calling
it filthy lucre. 1 Timothy 3.3.8. Tit. 1.7.
Yea, so unfit he holds it to be found among the Priests, that he would not
have it (if it were possible) so much as once Ephesians. 5.3. if that be the ^eaning
of (...) there: as translators have commonly rendered it.
named (at least not with allowance, not without some stigma upon it) among the
Saints.

8. There is an honest care to be had, I confess, of providing for a man's self,
and those that depend upon him: no less requisite in a Churchman then in every
other man; if not (in some respects) even much more: and verily he wants
either wit, or grace, or both, whoever neglects it. Yea further, since God
(...). 1 Cor. 9.14.
by his own ordinance) wages to him that labors in his work, (and if he be a
faithful labourer he is well worthy of it:) he may without injustice not only
expect it, but even exact it, of those that would unconscionably defraud him
therein. But why may not all this be done, and that effectually too, without
either bearing inwardly, or betraying outwardly, a greedy and covetous mind?
Whether then we provide for our own, by well husbanding what we have; or
whether we look for our own, by requiring our dues from others: Heb. 13.5. Luke
12.15.
still, still let our conversation be without covetousness. Take heed and
beware of Covetousness, says our Savior: charge, that we should double our
circumspection. Which if we do not, and that with more then ordinary
heedfulness; the love of the world will creep upon us, and by little and little
get within us, and steal away our hearts ere we can think it. Take It is an
evil spirit, but withal a subtle: and can slily wind it self in at a little
hole. But having once made entrance and gotten possession, it is not so easily
outed again. Rather it will quickly set open a wide door to seven more, and in
time to a whole legion of other evil spirits, (I cannot say, worse then it
self, for there are not many such: but certainly bad enough) to render the end
of that man much worse then the beginning. For the love of money is the root of
(very many, and even almost of) all evil: which while some have coveted after,
1 Timothy 6.10.
they have erred from the faith; made shipwreck of their consciences, and
entangled themselves But thou O man of God, fly from these things: fly
covetousness. -- 11.
Observe how careful the Apostle is every where to disclaim it: and be thou as
careful evermore to avoid it.

9. Observe hence secondly, what an aptness there may be even in very good men,
(through the remainders of natural corruption) to mis-interpret the speeches
and actions of their spiritual Fathers: as if in much of what they said or did,
they aimed most at their own secular advantage. That these Philippians had
charitable hearts, if there were no other proof, their great bounty both to our
Apostle Uncharitableness, that (as the sediments of depraved nature) lurk in
the hearts of the most charitable men: he might have saved the labor, that
sometimes he is put upon, of his own purgation. Hard the mean while is the
strait, men of our cloth are often put unto. If we let all go, and permit it
to men's consciences how they will deal with us, resolving to suffer and say
nothing: besides that we expose our selves both to loss and scorn; we also
betray Gods and the Churches right; and are also unfaithful in the work of our
calling, suffering sin upon our neighbor for want of a rebuke. But if we look
better about us, and require what of right belongs to us: Levit. 19.17.
then do men set their mouths wide open against us straight; And covetous are
we, if we do but speak for our own, (that is the least and best they can say:)
but if sue for it, then not covetous only, but contentious also. Yea, and this
is often done with such palpable iniquity, that there lies many times a deeper
imputation upon us, for but seeking to right our selves; then upon those who by
doing us manifest wrong enforce us thereunto. Alas! is this the double honor
you would bestow upon those that labor in the word: 1 Timothy 5.17.
first to maintenance, and then to rob them of their good names? Do you thus
reward the Oxen that tread out the corn for you? first to muzzle them up, that
they cannot eat; 1 Cor. 9.9.
and then to thrust another muzzle upon them, that they may not complain?

10. This is hard, you will say. It is so: but no more then, (so long as there
is such a proneness in most men, to mis-judge and mis-asperse those that are
set over them, especially if they meum and tuum,) we may expect from the men of
this generation, and should prepare for before we put our hand to the plow. It
should not therefore much discourage us (S. Paul counted it but a very small
thing) so long as we know nothing by our selves, 1 Cor. 4.3.
and do but what we may and ought: if we shall find our selves wrongfully and
upon light surmises taxed of Covetousness, of Ambition, of Time-serving, which
are the crimes usually laid in our dish, not only by the scum of the people,
men of lower rank and repute, but sometimes even by persons of quality, yea
such as pretend most to religion. Since holy Paul, then Protestations secure
himself from Ne admittam culpam ego meo sum p^omus pectori: Suspecio est in
pectore alieno sita. Plaut. in Trinum. 1.2.
the sinister jealousies and censures of those from whom he received
maintenance. Rather should their forwardness to judge thus uncharitably of us,
make us to walk the more warily and wisely, not to give them cause: but to be
sure in our whole course to have both the warrant for what we are to do, and
for what we have done the testimony of a good Conscience. That if yet they will
needs speak evil of us, as of evil doers; 1 Pet. 3.16.
they may do it gratis, and to their own shame, and not ours.

11. Observe hence thirdly, with what great caution the Apostle himself, or his
own affairs. It were certainly good for us, (in the public exercise of our
Ministry at least,) where we may avoid it, not to meddle at all with personal
and particular things, that concern either our selves or others. Both because
the more we descend to particulars, the more subject we are to mistakings, (for
descendendo contingit errare;) and the leaven of a little error or Indiscretion
in the pulpit, will sour a great lump of Truth and of Wholesome doctrine: As
also because personal matters can hardly be so dealt in, (especially in
public) but that, through prejudices the partiality of men's affections,
offense and distaste will be taken thereat by some or other. It were best for
us therefore, (that we either do not mistake, or be not mistaken,) to hold us
to general truths, forbearing personal matters, as much as may be. But where a
necessity lies upon us, not with convenience to be avoided, (as so the Case
may be,) to speak of our own or other men's particular concernments: it should
be our great care by our blessed Apostles example, to balance well every word
we speak, and to use such caution and discretion therein, that we leave nothing
(as far as is possible) subject to misconstruction; neither inject scruples the
just giving, but to use our best diligence also to prevent the unjust taking of
offense at any thing we shall deliver.

Fourthly, how ready the Apostle is upon every needful occasion, as to keep
himself from the Crime, so to clear himself from Omnes bonos, bonasque accurate
adderet, Suspicionem et culpam ut ab se segregent. Plaut. in Trinum. 1.2.
the suspicion of evil. He that is wanting to his own just defense,
transgresses the Law of God, and the rule of Charity, in bearing false witness
against himself. And it is not only cruel^y, but stupidity too, for a man wholly
to dis-regard what others think of him; Especially pernicious, when their
mis-conceits of the person may draw prejudice upon his Doctrine, and
consequently bring scandal unto the Gospel of Jesus Christ. It carries with it
ever a strong presumption of guilt, but an infallible argument it is of vanity
howsoever: When a man sweateth to put away a crime an excuse, ere any body have
accused him. But, for to stop the mouth of calumny upon a false charge, or to
prevent misprisions where they are likely to ensue, and may do harm if they
should ensue: there to justify our selves, and by public manifesto (as it
were) to disclaim what we might be wrongfully charged withal, is many times
expedient, and sometimes necessary. I am become a fool in glorying, says our
Apostle, but ye have compelled me. As who say, your under-valuing of me, 2 Cor.
12.11.
to the the Gospel, but advantage of false teachers, has made that glorying
now necessary for me, which had been otherwise but vanity and folly. When his
case falls to be ours; we may then do, as he now does, purge our selves from
false crimes and suspicions, and maintain our own innocence. Only be we first
sure, that our Consciences stand clear in the sight of God, before we endeavor
to clear our Credits before the faces of men. Lest by justifying our selves
before them, we contract a new guilt before him: and so become indeed worse
then we were, by striving to seem better then we are.

All these from the Protestation in the former part of the verse, Not that I
speak in respect of Want.

13. But the main of our business is (as I said) in the later part of the
verse: concerning the Nature and the Art of Contentment. All Arts have their
Praecognita: so has this. The first and chiefest whereof is (as in all other
Arts and Sciences) to understand. Quid sit Qua de re agitur, what it is that we
are to treat of as the subject matter of the whole discourse: as whereunto all
the Precepts, Rules, and Conclusions therein contained must relate. We shall
never learn the Art, unless we first know the Nature of Contentment. Of that
therefore first, from these words; (very few in the Original,) (...). In
whatsoever state I ^m.

14. Wherein the Nature of true Contentment is (by intimation) discovered from
the Object thereof in three particulars: partly limited, and partly unlimited.
Limited first, in respect of the Person: it must be a man's own estate. The verb
here is in the first person, (...), I am. Limited secondly, in respect of the
time: it present estate. The verb here is of the present tense, (...), I AM.
But thirdly, for the kind (high or low;) for the Quantity (great or small;)
for the Quality (convenient, or inconvenient;) and in every other respect,
altogether indifferent and unlimited. So it be a man's own, and present estate,
it mattereth not else what it be; (...) indefinitely, In whatsoever estate. In
these three jointly consists the nature of true contentment: in any of which
who ever fails, is short of St Paul's learning. That man only has learned to
be content, that can suffice himself with his own estate, with the present
estate, with any estate. Of these three Limitation in respect of the person,
That a man rest satisfied with his own estate.

15. The very thing (to my seeming) principally intended in the last
Commandment of the Decalogue, (...). Which forbids expressly the coveting of
our neighbors house, his wife, his cattle: and proportionably, the coveting of
his farm, his office, his honor, his kingdom: and generally the coveting of
any thing that is another. Which is as much in effect, as to require every man
to rest fully satisfied with that portion of outward things, which God has
been pleased by fair and justifiable ways in his They who conceit, the thing
in that Commandment properly forbidden, to be the Primi motus, those first
motions or stirrings of sin which we call Concupiscence, arising in the sensual
appetite (corrupted through Adam's fall, as all other Faculties of the soul
are) before any actual deliberation of the Understanding thereabout, or actual
consent of the Will thereunto: I must confess, do not satisfy me. For those
motions or stirrings, (supposing them sinful) are according to their several
objects (so far as they can be supposed sinful) forbidden in the Ten
Commandments respectively: even as the Acts are, to which they refer, and from
which they differ, not so much in kind as in degree. I much rather incline to
their judgment, who think the thing properly and principally there forbidden,
to be an inordinate desire after that, which by right or property is another,
and not ours.

16. And then these words of the Apostle, Heb. 13. may serve for a (short, but
full) commentary upon that last Commandment: both in the Negative, and in the
Affirmative part thereof. Let your conversation be without Covetousness; Heb.
13.5.
the Negative: and be content with such things as ye have; the Affirmative.
When we endeavor fraudulent, oppressive, or other unjust course; we are then
within the compass of the eight Commandment, Thou shall not steal: as is
evident from the Analogy of our Saviors expositions upon the other
Commandments, wherein Murder and Adultery are forbidden, Matthew. 5. Thou shall
not covet, comes more within us: condemning every inordinate desire of what is
not ours, albeit we have no actual intention to make it ours, by any unlawful
(either violent or fraudulent) means. The bare -- (...). Euripid. Hecub. act. 5.
wishing in our hearts, that what is our neighbors were Ours; his wife, house,
servant, beast, or his any thing Ours; without considering whether he be
willing to part with it or no, or whether it be meet for him so to do, or no:
is a cursed fruit of corrupt self-love, a direct breach of the holy Law of God
in that last Commandment, and flatly opposite to that (...), or
self-sufficiency, wherein true contentment

17. Ahabs sin was this, when first his teeth began to water after Naboths
vineyard. 1 King. 21.1* etc.
He went indeed afterward a great deal farther. He brake the eighth
Commandment, Thou shall not steal, and he brake the sixth Commandment also,
Thou shall not kill: when he took Naboths both life and vineyard from him by a
most unjust and cruel oppression. All this came on afterward. But his first
sin was merely against the last Commandment: in that he could not rest himself
satisfied with all his own abundance, but his mind was set on Naboths plot; and
unless he might have that too (lying -- o si angulus ille Proximus accedat; qui
nunc denormat agellum! Florat. 2. satyr. 6.
to his demesnes, he could not be at quiet. He had not as yet, (for any thing
appears in the story) any settled purpose, any resolved design, to wrest it
from the owner by violence, or to weary him out of it with injust vexations: So
he might but have it upon any fair terms; (either by way of Sale, he would
give him full as much for it as it could be worth of any man's money; or by way
of exchange, he would give him for it a better plot of ground then it was,
either way should serve his turn:) Naboth should but speak his own conditions,
and they should be performed. Many a petty Lord of a Hamlet with us, Enclosure,
to descend to such low capitulations with one of his poor neighbors, as the
great King of Israel then did with one of his subjects; and to sin but as
modestly, as Ahab yet did. Here was neither fraud nor violence, nor so much as
threatening, used: but the whole carriage outwardly square enough, and the
proposals not unreasonable. All the fault, (as yet) was within. The thing that
made Ahab even then guilty in the sight of God, was the inordinancy of his
desire after that vineyard, being not his own: which inordinancy, upon Naboths
refusal of the offered conditions, he farther bewrayed by many discontented
mind. For in he comes, heavy and displeased; takes pet, and his bed; looks
at no body, and out of fullenness forsakes his meat. Had he well learned this
piece of the lesson in the Text, to have contented himself with his own: both
his body had been in better temper, and his mind at better quiet, and his
conscience at better peace, then now they were.

18. Abraham it seems had learnt it. Who was so far from base desire of
enriching himself with the King of Sodoms goods, Genesis 14.21. etc.
that he utterly refused them, when he might have taken them, and held them
without any injustice at all. He had, or might have had, a double Title to
them. They were his (...). Arist. 1. Polit.
Iure belli, by the Law of arms and of Nations; having won them in the field,
and in a just war: and they might have been his jure donationis, by the Kings
free donation, [ Give me the persons, take the goods to thy self] if he had
been minded to accept the offer. But Abraham would none: contenting himself
with what the Lord had blessed him withal, he did not desire, neither would he
take from a thread a to shoo-latchet, of Sodom.

19. But what need we seek any other (indeed where can we find a better?)
example to instance in, as to the matter we now treat of, then this our
Apostle: if we do but recall to mind that Protestation of his once before
mentioned, made before the Clergy of Asia in his Visitation at Miletum Act.
20. Act. 20.33.
[ I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel.] Brave and noble was the
challenge, that Samuel made in a full assembly of the whole people of Israel [
Behold here I am, 1 Samuel 12.3.
witness against me before the Lord and before his Anointed. Whose Ox have I
taken? or Whose Ass have I taken? ] Possibly there are Judges and Officers in
the world, that would be loath to make so bold a challenge, and venture a fair
trial upon it. Yet comes that challenge far short of this protestation:
Samuel speaks only of not taking; S. Paul also of not coveting: according to
the express letter of the prohibition in the Decalogue. (...), Thou shall not
covet, says the Law: his Conscience answers, (...), I have not coveted. So
good a proficient was he, so perfect a scholar in this holy learning, that he
could it Verbatim. (...) might he well indeed learned to be content with his
own.

20. And might not we learn it too, think ye, as well as he? Sure we might:
for what should hinder? Only if we would but tie our selves strictly to those
Rules (those I mean of Justice and Charity) which are the first elements of
this learning. For Justice first: the Rule is, Suum cuique, That every man have
what of right to him appertains. Now every man's right unto any of the things
of this world, arises from Gods disposal thereof by such ways and means
(ordinarily,) as by the general Law, and the positive Laws of particular
Kingdoms and Commonwealths (not repugnant thereunto) are allowed for that end:
as Descent, Gift, Purchase, Industry, etc. Whose distributions, howsoever
unequal they may seem to us, are yet evermore just in themselves, and the just
owner and proprietary of that whereof he is the legal possessor: yea, though
it do appear to us to have been very unjustly gotten, either by himself, or by
any of those from whom he had it. His very possession I say, although without a
justifiable title, is yet sufficient to make it his, as to the entendment of
the Law in that behalf; that is to say, so far forth as to render our desiring
of it from him unlawful in foro interno: unless in that one case only, when
the right is in us, though he be in possession. In all other Cases possession
is a good plea: the Title of possession

21. If then we be at any time carried with a restless and immoderate desire
after that, which the hand of providence has been pleased to dispose
otherwhere, (and our selves have no antecedent right, whereby to entitle it
ours:) do we not take upon us (after a sort) to control the holy and wise
appointments of our good God? For if it were indeed fitter for us then him, and
not in opinion only: could not the Lord by his almighty power, and would he not
in the dispensation of his good providence, have by some honest means or other
disposed it upon us rather then By this extreme partiality to our selves, we
become unjust Judges of evil thoughts: in settling that upon our selves in our
own thoughts, as fittest for us, which God has thought fit to settle rather
upon another. The story in Xenophon, how young Cyrus was corrected by his Tutor,
for bestowing the two coats upon two of his schoolfellows, Lib. 1. (...).
according to the fitness thereof to their two bodies in his own discretion;
without enquiring first (as he should have done,) who was the right owner of
either, is so well known, and withal so pertinent to our present purpose, that
I shall not need either to relate it, or apply it. When Almighty God then, by a
property in them: it is an unjust desire in us, to covet them from him, and to
wish them transferred upon our selves.

22. The other Rule I told you of, is that of Charity. Which binding us to love
our neighbor as our selves, must needs bind us consequently to rejoice in his
good, as in our own; and not wish any thing to his prejudice, no more then to
our own: and consequently to these, to be content that he should enjoy that
which God has allotted him with our good wills, as we desire to hold that with
his good will. There is no such enemy to brotherly love, as is Self-love. For
look how much we bestow upon our selves more then we should, we must needs
leave to our brother so much less then we should. And it is nothing but this
overmuch love of our selves, that makes us so much cover to have to our
selves that which belongs not to us. If ye fulfill the Jam. 2.8.
Thou shall love thy neighbor as thy self, ye do well, says St James: Very
well this. But if ye have respect to persons, -- 9.
(especially if ye become partial once to your own persons;) that is not well:
then you commit sin, says he, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.

23. But this is Durus sermo, may some say. It were hard so to confine men's
minds to that which is their own, as not to allow any desire at all of that
which is another. If we should conceive the Law thus strict: it would destroy,
not only all humane ordinances that concern trading and commerce, as buying,
selling, exchanging, the divine ordinance also of earning our livings by labor
and industry. Then might no man endeavor by honorable and virtuous
achievements to raise himself a fortune, or make way for his future
advancement, or do any thing whatsoever, whereby to acquire or derive upon
himself a property in any thing that were not his own already: Since none of
all this can be done without a desire (in some degree or other) of that which
is another.

24. This Objection need not much trouble us. Nor Justice, nor Charity, nor the
holy Law of God which gives rules to both, condemn all desire of that which is
another; but an inordinate desire an orderly, and an inordinate desire: that
so we may be able to judge rightly concerning own desires at all times; whether
they be such as are allowed, and may consist with contentment, or such as are
forbidden and cannot consist therewith. Which is to be done by duly considering
of those three especial Qualifications, which are all requisite (the
concurrence, I mean, of the whole three) to the making up of an orderly desire:
in any of which if there be a failer, the desire becomes inordinate and
sinful. These three are, in respect First, of the Object; Secondly, of the Act;
Thirdly, of the Effect of the desire.

25. For the Object first. If I desire but that from my neighbor, (say it be
his house, land, beast, or other commodity) which I find him willing, or may
reasonably presume he will not be unwilling (for that I see no cause why he
should be so) to part withal; especially if the having thereof be visibly so
much greater advantage or convenience to me, then the parting therewith could
be loss or inconvenience to him, that I should be as ready to pleasure him bona
fide, and that I am willing withal to make him a valuable compensation to the
full for whatsoever loss or inconvenience he shall sustain thereby, desire is
thus far regular. In this manner Abraham desired of Ephron the Hittite a spare
portion in one end of his field for a burying-place for Sarah: when as, being a
stranger, he had no possession among them wherein to bury his dead, Genesis 23.

26. But if I shall desire to have that from him, Genesis 23.4, etc.
which probably is as useful and expedient for him, as it can be for me, or
which he takes some pleasure or content in, or is very unwilling howsoever
("though for no great reason perhaps, but for his minds sake only) to part
withal; or which (if it were mine own case) I should be desire
notwithstanding, and thirst after it still; this is an uncharitable, and so an
inordinate desire in me. Ahabs desire was such. After he saw Naboths heart so
set upon his ancient inheritance, that he would not part with it upon any
terms; For he had given him a flat denial, and rejected all motions for an
alienation with an Absit (the Lord forbid it me, that I should part with the
inheritance of my Ancestors:) yet he must have it tho; 1 King. 21.3.
nothing will content him without it. That for the Object.

Secondly, for the Act, or more immediate effect of the Desire. If I desire any
thing that is my neighbors with a moderate and sober desire; so as I can set
my heart at rest, fall out as it will, and compose my affections to an
indifferent temper whether I obtain my desire or no, (If I may have it, well
and good; if not, no great harm done, I am but where I was:) my desire is also
thus far regular, and hinders not but that I may be well enough content
notwithstanding.

28. But if my desire raise mudde and perturbations in me, and breed troubled
and confused thoughts, so as to disquiet me in my sleep, devotions, disturb me
that I cannot walk in the ways of my calling, or perform the common offices of
life with any cheerfulness, or any other way distemper the calm tranquillity of
my mind and soul: then is my desire so far forth an inordinate and covetous
desire, and inconsistent with true Contentation. And such again was Ahabs. When
he could not have his longing, Nec manus nec pes. He could neither eat nor
drink nor sleep, nor enjoy any thing he had, 1 King. 21.4.
nor do any thing he should, for thinking of it: nothing but lowre, and ^umble,
and fret for grief and despite: have it he must, or he should never be well.

Covetous, yet have a grudging of his disease: and it is an evil disease. For
tell me, (to close a little with thee, thou that scornest the name of
Covetous,) whence is it, that thou either pinest away with envy at the
greatness of thy neighbors, or repinest with murmuring at the scantness of thy
own portion? these are parlous symptoms. Why art thou ever and anon
maundering, that his -- majorque videtur, and melior, vicina seges. Juven. sat.
14.
farm then thine, his meddows greener then thine, his corn ranker then thine,
his cattle fatter then thine, his warehouse fuller then thine, his office
gainfuller then thine, his service better rewarded then thine, thine, Hor. 1
sermon. 1.
his trading quicker then thine, and I know not how many things more? Quodque
capella aliena gerat distentius uber
Tabescas? --
Must thine eye needs be evil toward imbecause the hand of God has good to
him? Toll quod tuum, and vade. Take that is thine, and go thy way, and rest
quiet with it. Be thankful to him that gave it, (it was more, I ween, then he
owed thee:) and in Gods name make thy best of it ( Spartam quam nactus es, hanc
orna.) But do not desire that inordinately, which thou can not compass
honestly, and which (if dishonestly gotten) thou should have little joy of,
when thou had it. Say thy lot be not all out as thou could wish (indeed
what man's almost is so?) yet take comfort in it onward, till better come.
Better may come, when God sees thee fit for better: but fit thou art not, so
long as thou art not contented with what thou have.

30. Lastly for the Consequents, or remoter effects of the Desire. Desire
looks ever at the end, carrying the mind and thoughts thither with some
eagerness: and therefore stirs endeavor in the use of such means as are
likely to bring men to the desired end the soonest, and so puts them upon
action. Whence commonly such as the desire is, such is the endeavor also: and
that, both for Quantity and Quality. According to the strength of the Desire is
the bent also of the endeavor: and according as the Desire is qualified, (
Morally qualified I mean, that is, either good or bad;) the endeavor also is
conditioned much what like it. my desire of something which another has, as to
resolve and hold, not at any hand to attempt the obtaining thereof by any other
then by fair and warrantable and conscionable means: 1 Samuel 24.4. and 26.8.
my desir^ is also thus far a regular and lawful desire. So David, though he
could not but desire the accomplishment of Gods gracious promise of advancing
him to the Kingdom, which was not his yet (otherwise then in Gods designation)
but another: yet when he was urged by his followers, 1 Samuel 24.6. and 26.11.
to lay hold of a fair opportunity, which (as they thought) God had put into
his hand for the effecting thereof: his soul did so much abhor the very Absit
too. Shall I lay these hands upon the Lords anointed? God forbid. No says he,
I will not do it for a kingdom. wicked facts I leave for wicked men to act. God
can and will I know in his due time make good his own promise without my sin. I
shall be content to wait his leisure, and to remain in the sad condition I now
am in, till it shall please him to bring me out of it, rather then clog my
conscience with the guilt of such a horrid crime. 1 Samuel 24.13.


31. But if my desire shall prompt to that resolution so common in the world, (
rem si possis, recte; si non, quocunque modo rem,) I would rather have it
fairly if it might be; Hor. 1. Ep. 1.
but if it will not come so, yet would I have it howsoever: my desire becomes
an unjust and inordinate desire. Such was Ahabs still: his example, the
Vineyard: ey, that he must. Cujus si dominus pretio non vincitur ullo. etc If
money will fetch it, Naboth shall have his own asking: Juven. sat. 14.
But if that will not do the deed, something else must. Letters shall be
written, Witnesses suborned, Judges awed, justice perverted, and an innocent
person (if the situation of his vineyard had not made him guilty) in a goodly
formal pageant of a legal proceeding with much base hypocrisy, and in a most
undue unworthy manner accused, condemned, executed. Quid non mortalia pectora
cogis? Stand amassed, and consider, what a mass of sin and mischief, the least
indulgence to a vicious inordinate desire may lead you to at the last, more
then perhaps you could at the first suspect your self capable to fall into.

32. What should I say then, Brethren? Even what our Lord has said before me,
Take heed and beware of Covetousness. Look upon all Inde fere scelerum causae:
nec plura-quam saeva cupido Immodici census. Juven. sat. 14.
the frauds that are practiced every where among the sons of men; take a survey
of all the oppressions, the greater oppressions, that are done under the sun:
you shall find the most of them to owe both their first birth and after-growth
to this cursed root of Covetousness. Extortion, Bribery, Flattery, Calumny,
Perjury, Simony, Sacrilege, Unjust Wars and Suits: do they not all come from
hence? 1 Timothy 6.10.
False Weights and measures in the markets; false lights and wares in the
shops, false pleas and oaths in the Courts; enhaunsing of fees, trucking for
expedition, racking of rents, cracking of banckrupts, depopulating of towns,
projecting of Monopolies, and God knows how many more, (my injustice and
uncharitableness, in coveting other men's goods, and not being content with
their own.

33. Upon this first point I have stood the longer, being the principal of the
three, and the foundation of the other two. That The Object of contentment, as
it is limited in respect of the Person; It must be a man's own estate, (of which
hitherto:) so is it limited in respect of the Time; It must be a man's present
Estate, (of which next.) The Text has not (...) in the preter. In what state I
have been; nor (...) in the future, In what state I shall be: but in the
present, (...), In whatsoever state I am. Look what God (who is Lord of all,
and dispenses to every man severally as he will) disposes upon him for the
persent; although perhaps far short of what he may have had heretofore, or of
what he may probably have in possibilities and reversions hereafter: he that
has a contented mind does not afflict himself, either with pensive thoughts,
at the remembrance of what he has been; or with suspenceful thoughts, in
forecasting both his hopes and fears what he may be: But he gives himself up
to the Lords present disposal, Heb. 13.5.
and rests satisfied with the portion that is before him. (...), says the
Apostle expressly, Heb. 13. being content -- (...). Isocrat. orat. de pace.
with the present things: and elsewhere, Having food and raiment ((...) in the
present tense still) let us be therewith content. 1 Timothy 6.8.


34. Grant but the former part, already made good, That we our own; and this
will follow of it self, That we are to be content with the present: because
nothing can be truly said to be our own but the present. What is past and gone,
perhaps it was ours; but we cannot say, It is ours, now: and what is future and
to come, perhaps it may be ours, (and perhaps it may not too;) but we cannot
say, It is ours yet. Panem nostrum quotidianum, our daily bread; or (as some
translate it) hodiernum, our this days bread: so we are taught to style it,
when we beg it. Nostrum and Hodiernum may be well put together: for it is only
this days bread that is our bread. Another days bread may be another man's
bread Horat. 2. sat. 2.
Nam propriae telluris herum natura nec illum,
Nec me, nec quenquam fecit --
All these things pass to and fro in the world from one hand to another, and so
to another, and another: ever and anon, upon some casualty or other, many times
-- tanquam Sit proprium cuiquam, puncto quod mobilis horae Permutet dominos,
and cedat in altera jura. Horat. 2. Epist. 2.
in a moment, shifting MASTERS; and seldom stay long in a place. When one
would think we had them fast: either they take them wings, and fly away, and
leave us behind; or our thread is cut, and we drop away, (s^ulte, hac nocte:)
and then what was ours goes another way, who knows whither? Perhaps to a
m^re stronger ( cujus erunt? Prove. 23.5. Luke 12.20.
) Thou fool, this night thy soul shall thou now call thine? Nothing is
certainly ours, but the present: and of that we have no farther certainty then
the present. So that unless we can frame our minds to be content with the
present, we shall never be able to find any certainty whereon to rest.

35. Add hereunto secondly, that all sollicitous looking forward and beyond the
present, does ipso facto and of it self take off so much from our content. It
raises up many foggie mists of hopes and fears and other perturbations, that
disquiet the mind wonderfully, and torture it with suspencefulness and anxiety.
Spemque metumque Whilst men, through the desire of having, hang in suspense
betwixt the hope of getting and the fear of missing; they cannot choose but
pierce themselves through with many sorrows, 1 Timothy 6.10.
and create themselves much unrest. Laetus in praesens animus quod ultra est
Oderit curare:
And again, Hor. 2. Carm* 16. -- 3. Carm. 8.
Dona praesentis cape laetus horae, and
Linque futura.
These and sundry other like passages we meet with in the Poets, together with
those phrases so usual with them, " -- (...). Anthol. 2. Epigr 47. -- Ille
potens sui, Laetus^ vivet, cui licet In diem dixisse vixi. Horat. 3 od. 29.
In diem vivere etc. -- would be good meditations for us: if we should
understand them in that Christian sense whereto we now apply them, and which
the words themselves will bear; and not in the Epicures sense, wherein for the
most part they that used them meant But I rather give it you in our Saviors
words; Take therefore no thought for the morrow, for the morrow shall take
thought for the things of it self: sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.
Mat 6.34.
Matthew. 6.

36. A third consideration there is, nothing less available then either of the
former, but rather much more, to them that can lay hold of it (for it is above
the reach of Poets and Philosophers, and beyond the ken even of professed
Christians that want the eye of Faith) to frame us to contentment with the
present: arising from the contemplation of the infinite love of our gracious
Lord God jointly with his infinite wisdom. By these as many as are truly the
children (by faith, and not titulo tenus only) are assured of this most certain
truth, that whatsoever their heavenly Father in his wisdom sees best for
them, that evermore in his love he provideth for them: From which Principle
every man that truly fears God, and has fixes his hope there, may draw this
infallible conclusion demonstratively and by the Laws of good discourse, ( per
viam regressus) presently ordered for me: and therefore it must needs be he saw
it presently best for me. Thus may we sugere mel de petra; gather grapes of
thorns, and figs of thistles, and satisfy our selves with the honey of
comfort out of the stony rock of barrenness and adversity.

37. Where are they then, that will tell you, On the one side what jolly men
they have been: But miserum est fuisse. Having been born and bred to better
fortunes, their spirits are too great to stoop to so low a condition as now
they are in. If it were with them, as in some former times, no men should lead
more contented lives then in chase or in expectation shall fall into their
hands, they doubt not, but they shall live as contentedly as the best. Little
do the one sort, or the other, know the falsness of their own unthankful and
rebellious hearts. If with discontent they repine at what they are; I shall
doubt they were never truly content with what they were and I shall fear
(unless God change their hearts) that they will never be well content with what
they shall be. He that is indeed content when the Lord gives, can be content
also when the Lord takes away; Job bless the holy name of God for both. Job.
1.21.
He had a mind contented in as good (though perhaps not in so high a) measure,
when he sat upon the dunghill scraping himself with a potsheard, in the midst
of his incompassionate friends; as he had when he sat in the gate judging the
people in the midst of the Princes and Elders of the Land.

38. It were certainly therefore best for us, to frame our minds now the best
we can to our present estate, be it better or worse: that whether it shall be
better or worse with us hereafter, we may the better frame our minds to it
then also. We should (...). Plato. Number. 9.15. etc.
following the Lord which way soever he leads us, as the Israelites followed
the guidance of the cloudy-fiery-pillar: When it went, they went; when it
stood, they stood: and look which way it went, to the North or to the South,
the same way they took: and whether it moved swiftly or slowly, they also
framed their pace accordingly. We in like sort to frame our selves and wills to
a holy submission, to whatsoever the present good pleasure of his will and
providence shall share out for us.

39. Which yet let no man so desperately mis-understand, as sloth and supinity,
with Solomon's sluggard, (whom that wise man censureth as a fool for it) who
foldeth his hands together; and lets the world wag as it will, without any
care at all what shall become of him and his another day. Eccl. 4.5. -- 6.
And yet, as if he were the only wise man ( Sapientum octavus, then seven men
that can render a reason) he speaks sentences, (but it is like a parable in a
fools mouth, Prove. 26.16. -- 7.
a speech full of reason in it self, but by him witlesly applied,) and tells
you* that Better is a handful with quietness, then both the hands full with
travel and vexation of spirit. Would you not think him the most contented soul
that lives? But there is no such matter. He is as desiring and as having, as
the most covetous wretch that never cease toyling and moyling to get more: if
he might but have it and never sweat for it.

40. Nor yet Secondly so, as to pass censure upon his brethren* as if it were
nothing but Covetousness or Ambition, when he shall providence, industry, and
good endeavors in a fair and honest course to lay a foundation for their
future better fortunes: as the currish Philosopher snarled at his fellow, Si
pranderet olus sapienter, regibus uti
Nollet Aristippus -- Hor. 1. epi. 17.

For so long as the ways we go are just and straight, and the care we take
moderate, and neither the things we look after unmeet for us, nor the event of
our endeavors improbable; if withal the minds we evenness, as to expect the
issue with patience, and neither be puffed up beyond measure with the good
success of our affairs, nor cast down beyond measure if they hap to miscarry:
it hinders not but we may at once both be well (...). Eurip. in Jon. act. 2.
contented with the present, and yet industriously provident for the future.
The same Poet has meetly well expressed it there, speaking again of the same
person, Omnis Aristippum decuit color, and status, and res. Tentantem majora,
fere praesentibus aequum. It is a point of wisdom, not a fruit of discontent,
when God opens to a man a fair opportunity of advancing his estate to an
higher or fuller condition the opportunity, and to use all meet diligence in
the pursuit, for the obtaining of his lawful desires. Rather it is a fruit
either of Pride, or Sloth, or both, to neglect it: though upon the pretense of
being content with the present.

41, Pass we now on from this Second, to the Third and last point observed
concerning the Object of true Contentment: which was the indifferency of it, as
it stands in the Text, for the kind, quantity, quality, and every other
respect (except the before excepted) altogether unlimited. (...) indifferently.
Be it high or low, rich or poor, base or honorable, easy or painful, prosperous
or troublous; all is a point: all that God sends is welcome. He that has
learned S. Paul's lesson, can make a shift with any estate, and rest satisfied
therewithal. The Apostle a little enlarges himself in the next verse: showing
that in the change of outward things, his mind yet continued unchanged, and
was still the same I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound:
every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry,
both to abound and to suffer need. And elsewhere he says of himself and his
fellow laborers in the Gospel, that in all things they had been careful to
approve themselves as the Ministers of God, 2 Cor. 6.4, 7. etc.
by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, by honor
and dishonor, by evil report and good report, etc. As indeed it is a point of
the same skill, to know how to abound and how to want: and equally hard to bear
prosperity without insolence, and adversity without impatience. Agur was
therefore equally afraid of both, when he prayed that God would neither give
him excessive riches, Prove. 30.8.
nor extreme poverty; As one that well knew there was great and equal danger in
the one extreme as well as in the other; if God should leave us to wrestle with
the temptations that may arise from either of them by our own strength alone
without the aydance of his grace. But he whose heart is established with grace,
can sort his mind to any estate, and find content in any. He can sleep, both
securely in a palace, and thankfully in a cottage.

42. Reasons are: for I must hasten. First, Contentment comes from the mind
within, not from the things without. Non Seneca.
If the things themselves were enough to afford content, or breed discontent:
then should all men that enjoy them alike, be alike contented therewith; and
all men that want them alike, be alike discontented thereat. Whereof daily
experience shows the contrary. It is therefore from the different furniture
of the mind, that men are differently affected both with plenty and want. Now
the mind of a godly man being settled upon God by a holy dependence upon his
providence: hence it is, that neither height nor depth, neither want nor
abundance, neither things nor things to come, nor any worldly accident can
drive him from that hold. He shall not be moved for ever, neither shall be
daunted with any evil tidings: Psalm. 112.6.7.
because his heart is fixed, and his trust is in the Lord. Psalm. 112.

Si fractus illabatur orbis
Hor. 3. Carm. 3.
Impavidum ferient ruinae.
43. Secondly, such a vast disproportion there is between the reasonable soul
of man, and the sublunary creatures; that the appetite of that cannot be filled
with any of these. Capacem Dei non The soul being capable of a Communion with
God by grace, and the fruition of him in glory, cannot be satisfied with any
thing that is less then God; nor therefore with any thing but God. At the last
day, when the Saints shall enjoy fullness of glory Satiabor cum apparuerit
gloria, When I awake I shall be satisfied with thy likeness, Psalm. 17.15.
Psalm. 17.) In the mean time they are satisfied with a kind of fullness,
according to the measure of their present capacity: such a fullness as
suffices for the sustaining of their souls with patience and comfort, (
Sufficit tibi gratia: Till that satiety of Glory come, 2 Cor. 12.9.
my Grace is sufficient for thee onward.) Hence grows another difference
between the godly, and the worldly man. The one is content with nothing:
because for want of Grace he has not a sufficiency within, outward things. The
other is content with any thing: because he has a sufficiency of Grace within
him, whereof (so long as he persisteth in that state, and but by his own
default,) no creature in the world can deprive him.

44. Again thirdly, the increase of outward things rather provokes the
appetites of the soul, then stilleth them: and by that means rather puts a
man further off from content, then he was before. -- Et minus haec optat, qui
non habet. Iuven. sat. 14.
He that loves silver, says Solomon, shall not be satisfied with silver: nor
he that loves abundance with increase. Eccl. 5.10.
As a River the greater it grows by receiving in little brooks, the wider and
the deeper it wears the channel: so all outward things, the more they
increase, the more they enlarge the desires, still to their own proportion. Was
ever Voluptuous, or Ambitious, or Covetous, or Malicious man, so glutted either
with pleasures, or preferments, or riches, or revenge, as not to desire more?
Only the godly man's hopes are not so nipt with the decay, nor his desires so
extended upon the increase of these outward things as to hinder his content.
Because hopes, nor desires are set upon the world, or the things of the world:
but upon God, and his Christ, and his Spirit and his Promises.

45. First then (to infer somewhat, briefly) why should thou that live in
a low and mean estate, envy him that has a far greater: which yet is as far
from giving him content, as thine would be if it were his. When riches
increase, they are increased that eat them: and what profit, Eccl. 5.11.
(or pleasure either) is there to the owner thereof, save the beholding them
with his eyes? All the advantage he has is but this: that he can say, All this
is mine. The warm to thee, as to him: the air as sweet. Thy fare, though not
so costly, yet as savoury: thy body as healthy, thy mind as free, as his: thy
sleep as soft, though upon a harder bed: thy rest as safe, though under a
meaner roof. If there be any difference, here it is: That as his estate is
greater; so his charge is greater, and his cares greater, and his fears
greater, and his troubles greater: reckoning shall be greater. Therefore envy
him not.

46. Secondly, In this, as in most other things, most of us (God help us) make
our selves a great deal of work more then needs, because we go the wrong way to
work. For the bringing of our minds and our estates together, (for that is in a
manner the whole business: till they meet, there can be no true Contentment:)
we commonly begin at the wrong end, and so lose our labor. We strive to fit
all things to our minds: which (so long as our desires are vast and
boundless,) is a tedious and bootless work. Horace.
-- Non si te ruperis. We may tug hard at it; sweat till our hearts ache: but it
will not be. Why do we not rather begin at the other end? do that rather, which
is not only possible, but (the grace of God assisting) easy also? Seneca.
in striving to fit our minds to the things. Non augendae res, sed minuendae
cupiditates: that is the way. To work our own Contentment, we should not labor
so much (...). Plat. 7. de legib.
to increase our substance, (that is a preposterous course;) as to moderate our
desires: which is the right way, and the more feizible. Jacob did not propose
to bread to eat, and raiment to put on, Genesis 28. No matter of what course
grain: Genesis 28.20.
so it were but bread, to give nourishment, and maintain life. No matter for
the stuff, or fashion: so it were but raiment; to cover nakedness, and to keep
off heat and cold. Neither does St Paul speak of any choicer or costlier
matter. Having food and raiment, says he, let us be therewith content, 1 Timothy
6. He says not (...), 1 Timothy 6.8.
delicates; but (...), food: nor (...), ornaments; but (...), raiment,
coverings. Any filling for the belly, any hilling for the back, would serve his

47. Thirdly, since it is a point of the same skill to do both; to want, and to
abound: we should do well, whilst the Lord lends us peace and plenty, to
exercise our selves duly in the Art of abounding; that we be the better able to
manage the Art of wanting, if ever it shall please him to put us to it. For
therefore especially are we so much to seek, and so puzzled that we know not
which way to turn us, when want or afflictions come upon us: because we will
not keep within any reasonable compass, nor frame our selves to industrious,
thrifty, and charitable courses, when we abundance. It is our extreme insolency
and unthankfulness when we are full, that makes our impatience and
discontentedness break forth with the greater extremity, when the Lord
begins to empty us. Quem res plus nimio delectavere secundae, Horat. 1.
Epist. 10.

Mutatae quatient.
As in a fever, he that burns most in his hot sit, shakes most in his cold:
so no man bears want with less patience, then he that bears plenty with
least moderation. If we would once perfectly learn to abound, and not riot: we
should the sooner learn to want, and not repine.

48. But how am I on the sudden, whilst I am discoursing of the Nature, fallen
upon some of the Rules of the Art of contentment? the Text neither: the word
(...) contains that too. Yet because to lay down the grounds and method of
that Art, and to do it to purpose, another hours work would be but little
enough: I shall therefore forbear to proceed any further at this time. Now to
God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost, etc.


OTELANDS, JULY 1637.
Philip. 4.11. -- for I have learned in whatsoever state I am,


1. TO omit what was observed from the Apostles Protestation in those first
words of the verse, [ Not that I speak in respect of want:] from these words in
the later part of the verse we have proposed formerly to speak of two things
concerning Christian Contentment: first of the Nature of it, and wherein it
consists; and the Art of it, and how it may be attained. The Nature of it
has been not long since somewhat opened, according to the intimations given in
the Text, in three particulars. Wherein was shown, that that man only lives
truly contented, that can suffice himself first, with his own estate; secondly,
with the present estate; thirdly, (being his own and the present,) with any
estate [(...) I am now by the laws of good order, and the tie of a former
promise, to proceed to the like discovery of the Art of Contentment: by
occasion of this word (...). [ I heve learned, in whatsoever estate I am to be
therewith content.]

2. Saint Paul was not framed unto it by the common instinct of nature: neither
had he hammered it out by his own industry, or by any wise improvement of
nature from the precepts of Philosophy and Morality: nor did it spring from the
abundance of outward things, as either an effect, or an appurtenance thereof.
It was the alone, that had wrought it in his heart by his saving and
sanctifying Spirit, and trained him up thereunto in the school of experience
and of afflictions. The Sum is, that True contentedness of mind is a point of
high and holy learning; whereunto no man can attain; unless it be taught him
from above. What the Apostle says of Faith, is true also generally of every
other Grace; and of this in particular, Ephesians. 2.8.
as an especial and infallible effect of Faith: [Not of your selves, it is the
gift of God.] And of this in particular the Preacher so affirms in Eccles. 5.
[ Every man also, to whom God has given riches and wealth, Eccles. 5.19.
and has given him power to eat thereof, and to take ]

3. Neither is it a common gift, like that of the rain and Sun, the comfort
whereof are indifferently afforded to good and bad, to the thankless as well as
the thankful: Matthew. 5.46. Luke 6.35.
but it is a special favor which God vouchsafes to none, but to those that
are his special favorites, his beloved ones; [ -- he gives his beloved sleep.
Psalm. 127. whiles others rise up early and go to bed late, Psalm. 127.3.
and eat the bread of sorrows; restlesly wearing out their bodies with toil,
and their minds with care: they lay them down in peace, and their minds are at
rest; They sleep. But it is the Lord only that makes their rest so soft and he
gives them sleep. And the bestowing of such a gift is an argument of his
special love toward them that partake it; He gives his beloved sleep. It is
indeed Gods good blessing, if he give to any man bare riches: but if he be
pleased to second that common blessing with a farther blessing, and to give
contentment withal; then it is to be acknowledged a singular and most
excellent blessing; as Solomon says, [ The blessing of the Lord, it makes
rich; and he adds no sorrow with it. Prove. 10.22. Eccles. 2.26.
] In Eccles. 2. the same Solomon tells us, that contentment comes from none
but God, and is given to none but the godly: For, says he, God gives to a man
that is good in his (and that is the godly only) wisdom and knowledge, and joy.
But as for the sinner, none of all this is given to him. What is his portion
then? even as it there follows, [But to the sinner he gives travail to
gather, and to heap up.] The sinner possibly may gather as much together as the
godly, or more; and raise to himself heaps of worldly treasure: but when he
has done, he has but his travel for his pains. He has not wisdom and
knowledge to understand the just valuation and the right use of that which he
has gathered together: he takes no joy, he takes no comfort in those heaps;
he finds nothing in them but cares and disquietness, and vexation of spirit;
[ All his days are sorrows, and his travel grief, yea his heart takes not
rest in the night. -- 23.
] It is not thefore without cause, that our Apostle so speaks of contentment,
as of the handmaid unto godliness; [ But godliness with contentment is great
gain. 1 Timothy 6. 1 Timothy 6.6.
]

truth whereof will yet farther appear unto us, if we shall consider of these
two grounds: First, that in all other things there is an unsufficiency; and
Secondly, that there is a sufficiency in the grace of God to work Contentment.
We cannot conceive any other things, besides the Grace of God, from which
Contentment can be supposed to spring, but those three; Nature, Morality, and
Outward things. All which in the trial will appear to be altogether
insufficient to work this effect. First Nature, (as it is now corrupt,)
inclines our hearts and affections strongly to the world: the inordinate love
whereof, first breeds, and then cherishes our discontent. Whiles between the
desire of having, and the fear of 1 Timothy 6.10.
we continually pierce our selves thorough with a thousand cares and sorrows.
Our lusts are vast, as the sea; and restless, as the sea: and, as the sea, will
not be bounded but by an almighty power. The horseleach has but two daughters;
Prove. 30.15.
but we have I know not how many craving lusts, no less importunately clamorous
then they* Till they be served, incessantly crying Give, Give, but much more
unsatisfied then they; for they will be filled in time, and when they are full
they tumble off, and there is an end. Genesis 41.21.
But our lusts will never be satisfied: like Pharaohs thin kine, when they have
eaten up all the fat ones, they are still as hungry and as whining as
infinitely covetous; we never think our selves rich enough, but still wish
more: and we are by nature infinitely timorous; we never think our selves safe
enough, but still fear want. Neither -- nam qui cupiet, metuat quoque porro:
Qui metuen^ vivit, liber mihi non erit unquam. Hor. 1. Epist. 16.
of both which alone, (much less both together,) can stand with true
Contentment. This flower then grows not in the garden of (corrupt) Nature,
which is so rankly overgrown with so many, and such pestilent and noisome
weeds.

5. But perhaps the soil may be so improved by the culture of Philosophy, and
the malignity of it so corrected by moral institution; Contentment may grow and
thrive in it. No: that will not do the deed neither. True it is, that there are
to be found in the writings of heathen Orators, Poets, and Philosophers, many
excellent and acute sentences and precepts tending this way: and very worthy to
be taken notice of by us Christians, both to our wonder and shame. To our
wonder, that they would espy so much light as shame withal, who enjoying the
benefit of divine revelation, and living in the open sunshine of the glorious
Gospel of truth, have profited thereby in so small a proportion beyond them.
But all their sentences and precepts, fall short of the mark: they could never
reach that solid Contentment they levelled at. Horat. 1. Epist. 1.
Sunt verba and voces, -- as he said; and he said truer then he was aware of:
for they are but words indeed, empty of truth and reality. The shadow of
contentment they might catch at: but when they came to grasp the substance,
Nubem pro Iunone, they ever found themselves deluded. Genesis 19.11.
As the blinded Sodomites that beset Lots house, they fumbled about the door,
perhaps sometimes stumbled at the threshold: but could not for their lives
either find or make themselves a way into the inner rooms. The greatest
Contentments their speculations could perform unto them, Horat. de Art.
were but aegri somnia; Not a calm and soft sleep, like that which our God
gives his beloved ones; but as the slumbring dreams of a sick man; very short,
and those also interrupted confused fancies. Which possibly may be some small
refreshing to them amid their long weary fits: but cannot well be called Rest.
Now the very true reason, of this unsufficiency in whatsoever precepts of
Morality unto true Contentment, is, because the topics from whence they draw
their persuasions are of too flat and low an elevation. As being taken from the
dignity of man, from the baseness of outward things, from the mutability of
fortune, from the shortness and uncertainty of life, and such like other
considerations, as come within their own spear: Useful indeed in their kind,
but unable to bear such a pile and roof as true grounds of sound Contentment,
which are the persuasions of the special providence of God over his children,
as of a wise and Loving father, whereby he disposes all things unto them for
the best; and a lively faith resting upon the rich and precious promises of God
revealed in his holy word: they were things quite out of their element, and
such as they were wholly ignorant of. And therefore no marvel if they were so
far to seek in this high and holy learning.

6. But might there not in the third place be shaped, at least might there not
be imagined, a fitness and competency of outward in such a mediocrity of
proportion every way unto a man's hopes and desires; as that contentment would
arise from it of it self, and that the party could not choose but rest satisfied
therewithal? Nothing less. For first, experience shows us, that contentment
arises not from the things, but from the mind; even by this, that soonest and
sorest of the greatest and wealthiest men. Which would not be, if greatness or
wealth were the main things required to breed Contentment. Secondly, those men
that could not frame their hearts to contentment, when they had less, will be
as far from it, if ever they shall have more. For their desires, and the
things, will still keep at a distance; because as the things come on, so their
desires come on too. As in a coach, though it hurry away never so fast, yet the
hinder wheels will still be behind the former, as much as they were before.
And therefore our Apostle in the next verse makes it a point of equal skill,
and like deep learning, to know how to be full, as well as how to be hungry;
and how to abound, as well as how to suffer need. Thirdly, it is impossible
that Contentment should arise from the things; because contentment supposes a
sufficiency ((...) supposes to (...)) whereas there is ever some deficiency or
other in the things desired. What man had ever all things so sortable to his
desires, but he could spy some thing or other wanting? -- tamen Curtae nescio
quid semper abest rei. all he has does him not so much pleasure, Horat. 3. Od.
24.
as the want of that one thing tortureth him. As all Hamans wealth, and
honors, and favor with the King, and power in the Court, Ester. 5.13.
availed him nothing, for want of Mordecay's knee. And Ahab could not be merry,
nor sleep, nor eat bread, 1 King. 21.4.
though he swaied the Scepter of a mighty Kingdom, for want of Naboths
vineyard. Or if we could suppose contentment should arise from the things, yet
fourthly it could have no stability nor certainty of continuance: because the
things themselves are subject to casualties and vicissitudes. And the mind of a
man that should repose upon such things, must needs Gaudium in materia
convertibili, mutari necesse est, re mutata. Bernard. sermon. 1. de diversis.
rise and fall, ebb, and flow, just as the things themselves do. Which is
contrary to contented mind; which still remains the same and unchanged,
notwithstanding whatsoever changes and chances happen in these outward and
mutable things.

7. We see now the unsufficiency of Nature, of Morality, of Outward things, to
bring Contentment. It remains then, that it must spring from Religion, and
from the Grace of God seated in the heart of every godly man: which casts him
into a new mould, and frames the heart to a blessed calm within, whatsoever
storms are abroad, and without. And in this Grace there is no defect. As the
Lord sometimes answered our Apostle, when he was importunate sufficit tibi
gratia, My grace is sufficient for thee. 2 Cor. 12.9.
He then that would attain to St Paul's learning, must repair to the same
school, where St Paul got his learning, and he must apply himself to the same
tutor that St Paul had. He must not languish in porticu, or in Lyceo; at the
feet of Plato or Seneca: but he must get him the sanctuary of God, and there
become (...), he must be taught of God, and by the anointing of his holy spirit
of grace; which anointing teaches us all things. 1 John 2.27.
1. Ioh. 2. All other masters are either Ignorant, or Envious, or Idle. Some
things they are not able to teach us, though they would: some things they are
not willing to teach us, though they might: but this Anointing is every way a
most complete tutour, Able, and loving and active: this anointing teaches us
all things, and amongst other things this Art of Contentation also.

8. Now as for the means, whereby the Lord traineth us up by this learning:
they are especially these three. First, by his spirit he works this
persuasion in our hearts, that whatsoever he disposes unto us at any time for
the present, that is evermore the fittest and best for us at that time. He
gives us to see, that all things are guided and ordered by a most just and
wise and powerful providence. And although it be not fit for us to be
acquainted with the particular reasons of such his wise and gracious
dispensations: yet we are assured in the general, that all things work together
for the best to them that love God; Romans 8.28.
That he is a loving and careful father of his children, and will neither bring
any thing upon them, nor keep back any thing from them, but for their good;
Physician, such a one as at all times and perfectly understands the true
state and temper of our hearts and affections, and accordingly orders us and
dieteth us, as he sees it most behoofefull for us (in that present state) for
the preservation or recovery of our spiritual strength, or for the prevention
of future maladies. And this persuasion is one special means, whereby the Lord
teaches us Contentment with whatsoever he sends.

9. Secondly, whereas there are in the word scattered every where, many
gracious and precious promises, not only concerning life to come, but also
concerning this present life: the spirit of grace in the heart of the godly,
teaches them by faith to gather up all those scattered promises, and to apply
them for their own comfort upon every needful occasion. They hear by the
outward preaching of the word, and are assured of the truth thereof by the
inward teaching of the spirit, That God will never fail them nor forsake them;
Heb. 13.5. Psalm. 23.1. etc. Psalm. 33.18.-9.
That he is their shepherd and therefore they shall not want, but his goodness
and mercy shall follow them all the days of their lives; That his eyes is upon
them that fear him, to deliver their souls from death, Psalm. 84.11. Psalm. 34.11.
and to feed them in the time dearth; That he will give That though the Lions
(the great and greedy oppressors of the world,) may lack and suffer hunger, yet
they which seek the Lord shall want no manner of thing that is good: and a
thousand other such promises they hear and believe. The assurance whereof is
another special means, by which the Lord teaches his children to repose
themselves in a quiet content, without fear of want, or too much thoughtfulness
for the future.

10. Thirdly, for our better learning, besides these lectures of his providence
and promises, he does also both appoint us exercises, and discipline us with
his rod. By sending changes and afflictions in our bodies, in our names, in our
friends, in our estates, in the success of our affairs, and many other ways;
but always for our profit. (...).
And this his wise teaching of us brings on our learning wonderfully. As for
those, whose houses are safe from fear, Heb. 12.10. Job. 21.9. Jer. 48.11.
Prove. 1.32.
neither (as Job speaks) that are never emptied nor powered from vessel to
vessel: they settle upon their own dregs, and grow muddy and musty with long
ease, and their prosperity befooleth them to their own destruction. When these
come once to stirring, and trouble over-taketh them, (as sooner or later they
must look for it:) then the grumbles and mud of their impatience and discontent
begins to appear, and becomes unsavory both to God and man. But as for
those, whom the Lord has taken into his own tuition and nurturing; he will not
suffer them wax wanton with too long ease, nor to be depressed with too heavy
troubles: but by frequent (...). Nazian. Carm. de vita sua. 2 Cor. 6.7. etc.
changes he exercises them and inureth them to all estates. As a good Captain
traineth his soldiers, and puts them out of one posture into another, that
they may be expert in all: so the Lord of hosts traineth up his soldiers by
the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, by honor and
dishonor, by evil report and good report, by health and sickness; by sometimes
raising new friends, and sometimes taking away the old; by sometimes suffering
their enemies to get the upper hand, and sometimes bringing them under again;
by sometimes giving success to their affairs even beyond their expectation, and
sometimes dashing their hopes when they were almost come to full ripeness. He
turns them this way and that way and every way, till they know all their
postures, and can readily cast themselves into any form that he shall appoint.
They are often abased, and often exalted; now full, and anon hungry: one while
they abound, and they suffer need another while. Till with our Apostle they
know both how to be abased, and how to abound: Till every where and in all
things they be instructed both to be full, and to be hungry, Verse. 12.
both to abound, and to suffer need: Till they can (at least in some weak, do
all things through Christ that strengthens them. -- 13.
These Meditationes militares. (...).
exercises are indeed the most unpleasing part of this holy learning,
especially to a young novice in the school of Christ; (the Apostle says truly
of it, Heb. 12.11.
Heb. 12. that for the present it is not joyous, but grievous.) But yet it is a
very necessary part of the learning, and marvelously profitable after a time:
for (as it there also follows) Nevertheless afterward it yields the quiet
and peaceable (...)
unto them which are exercised thereby.

11. We have hitherto seen the point opened and proved, that true Christian
contentment springs not first from Nature, nor secondly from Morality, nor
thirdly from Outward things: but is taught only by God himself. Who first
persuades the hearts of his children, out of the acknowledgement of his
fatherly providence, that that estate is ever presently best for them which
they have for the present: and assures them secondly, by faith in his temporal
promises, that they shall never want any thing that may be good for them for
the time to come; and thirdly, exercises and inureth them, by frequent
enterchanging of prosperity and adversity, and sanctifying both estates unto
them, both to glorify him, and to satisfy themselves by, and with either.
(...) here, and in the next verse (...), I have learned, and have been
thereunto instructed, and as it were initiated into it as into an art or
mystery; in whatsoever state I am, therewithal to be content. Now for the Uses
and Inferences hence.

12. First, S. Paul's (...) here notably discovers, both the vanity of those
men, who boast as if they had minds richly content, when as yet they never knew
what grace and godliness meant: and withal the folly of those men, that seek
for, or promise to themselves contentment, but seek for it other where then
where alone it is to be found, that is to say in the school of Christ, and of
his holy Spirit. In all learnings it is a point of special consequence to get a
good Master. He has half done his work, that has made a happy choice that
way. And the more needful the learning is, the greater care would be had in
the choice. Here is a piece of excellent learning every man will confess. Why
should any of us then trifle away our time to no purpose, and put our selves to
a great deal of fruitless pains, to learn contentment from those that cannot
teach it. Yet such is the folly of most of us: we seldom look farther our
selves, seldom higher then these sublunary things for this learning. It is one
of our Vanities, that we love to be (...), and we glory not a little in that
knowledge, which we have hammered out by our own industry without a teacher.
But that which we use to say in other learnings, is indeed most true in this;
Qui sibi magistrum se constituit, stulto se discipulum subdit. Bern. Epist. 87.
He that scorneth to be taught by any but himself, shall be sure to have a fool
to his Tutor. Cato, and Seneca, and other the wisest and learned among
Philosophers, ever shrunk when they came to the trial: and by their
timerousness and discontentedness sufficiently discovered the un-usefulness (or
at least the unsufficiency) of their precepts, to effect that blessed
tranquillity of mind which they promised. Professing themselves (in their
speculations) to be wise, (in their practice) they became fools; (...).
and were confounded in the vanity of their own imaginations. Romans 1.22.
It was a vain brag of him that said it, Hoc satis est orare Iovem, qui donat
and aufert,
Det vitam, det opes: animum mi aequum ipse parabo. Horat. 1. Epist. 18.

He would pray to Jupiter to give him health, and to give him wealth: but as
for Contentment, he would never put him to trouble for that. If he might have
health and wealth, he doubted not but he could carve out his own contentment
well enough without any of Jupiters help. Little did he know the cursed
corruption of his own heart: and that he stood rather in more need of God for
this then for those other things. A far wiser man then he has told us from his
it is a common evil among men; A man to whom God has given riches, wealth and
honor, so that he wants nothing for his soul of all that he desires, yet
gives him not power to eat thereof, Eccles. 6.1, 2. But admit his brag had
been as true, as it was vain; and that he could indeed have wrought his own
contentment, if Jupiter should give him the things he required: yet still he
had come far short of St Paul's learning in the Text. For even by his own
confession, he could not raise himself a contentment out of nothing. He must
have wealth and health to work upon, or else in whatsoever state he should be
to be therewith content. Which yet every poor simple Christian, that truly
fears God, has in some measure attained unto: who can find contentment also
in sickness and in poverty, if the Lord be pleased to send them, as well as in
health and plenty; and bless his Name for both in the words of holy Job, (The
Lord has given, the Lord has taken; blessed be the name of the Lord. Job 21.
)

13. Secondly, since Contentment is a point of learning as we see, and we know
also where it is to be learned, or not at all: it were willing to learn it. St
Paul had never had it, if he had never learned it: and you see what use he had
of it, and how mightily it did bestead him the whole course of his life, after
he had learned it. And the more to quicken you hereunto, take into your
consideration amongst other these inducements. Consider first, the excellency
and difficulty of this learning. Most scholars will not satisfy themselves
with the knowledge of ordinary and obvious things, but are desirous to learn
things that are beyond the reach of the vulgar. Lo now, here is a lesson worthy
the ambition of every disciple in the school Princes or Philosophers of the
world, by all their power or wisdom, could ever attain unto. But that the
difficulty discourage you not, Consider secondly, that (as we use to say, so
indeed) there is nothing hard to a willing mind. Isocrat. ad Demon.
(...), you know. But here is the misery of it, that as boys love play, so we
love the world: and this makes trewants in our learning. And so we are long
about a little, because we cannot abide to ply it. But if we would once set our
selves to this spiritual learning with all our might, and buckle close to it,
certainly we should in short time find our selves to have profited in it
wonderfully. Consider thirdly, Psalm. 34.11. 1 Samuel 3.9.
how willing our Master is to teach us; ( Come ye children, I will teach you
the fear of the Lord:) and let that provoke in us the like willingness to
learn; (Speak Lord, for thy servant hears.) Consider Fourthly, the usefulness
of this learning. We desire all of us (and good reason we have,) to learn
perfectly the mysteries trades and professions, which we intend to exercise as
our particular Callings, because thereof we shall have continual use, in the
whole course of our lives. This learning we now speak of, is a holy mystery;
((...) is the Apostles word for it in the next verse:) and it is a most useful
and behoofeful and necessary mystery for us all in the whole practice of
Christianity: there is indeed no good to be done in our Christian profession
without it. See some benefits of it, and then judge if it be not worth the
learning. It sweetneth all the bitterness of this present life. To labor and
to be content with that a man has is a sweet life, Sirac. 40.18.
says the son of Sirac, in his 40th chapter. It keeps the mind in a
constant equal tranquillity rich in despite of the world: for what riches is
like this, for a man to want nothing? He may be without many things that others
have, but he wants them not: even as the Angels in heaven, that have neither
meat, nor drink, nor clothes, nor houses, nor lands, nor any of those bodily
things, yet want none of them; because they are well enough without them: And
so the contented man, though having nothing, yet is in the self-sufficiency of
his mind as if he possessed all things. 2 Cor. 6.10.
It gives a wonderful improvement unto the meanest of these outward things;
and by disesteeming them, sets learned this Art, is able by his learning to
make a dinner of green herbs as serviceable, as a stall-fed Ox, and a little
pulse and water as comfortable and savoury, Prove. 15.17. Dan. 1.12. etc.
as all the delicacies in the kingdom of Babylon. How should the consideration
of these things whet our desires and resolutions, not to suffer our eyes to
sleep, till we had made some entrance into, and some fair proceedings in this
so excellent and profitable a learning.

14. A needful Exhortation, may some say, for those that are yet to learn: but
as for us, we have been long acquainted contented minds, as any man would
desire. The happier men they, Jer. 17.9. Romans 12.3.
if it prove so: but the heart of man is very wicked and deceitful; and it were
good for us not to think well of our selves above what we ought to think. Sure
I am that in all secular the old saying is most true, (...). There is no
greater hinderance unto proficiency, than is an (...). Nazi. Orat. 1.
overweening conceit in any man of that learning he has already. And not
unlikely but in this spiritual learning also, that man that (...). Ibid.
wants skill the most, may see his own want the least. That therefore we may
deal soundly in the trial of our own hearts, and not deceive our selves herein
upon false grounds, as we may soon do, and as too many do: it will be expedient
in the third place to lay down some rules for the examination of our
proficiency, if not rather for the conviction of our non-proficiency, in this
kind of learning.

first, if a man have once attained to a good mediocrity in this Art, it will
not suffer him to transgress the bounds of Justice and Charity, for the getting
of the things of this life. He knows very well, according to the Principles
he has been taught: That a little with righteousness is better then great
revenues of the ungodly; Prove. 16.8.
-- 10.2.
That the treasures of wickedness will do a man little profit in the evil day,
nor yield him any comfort; (when he will most of all stand in need thereof,)
upon his deathbed; -- 20.21.
That though an inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning, yet the end
thereof And that bread gotten by deceit, -- 20 17.
however it may be sweet in the mouth, will turn to gravel in the belly. Genesis
14.23.
Abraham would not take to himself of the spoils of Sodom to the value of a
shooe-latchet; that it might never be said in after times, that the King of
Sodom had made Abraham rich. So neither will any godly man, that has learned
the Art of Contentation, suffer a penny of the gain of Ungodliness to mingle
with the rest of his estate; that the Devil may not be able to upbraid him with
it afterward to his shame, as if he had contributed something toward the
increasing thereof. Try thy self now by this first Rule, thou that contented
mind; but show not thy self over-scrupulous, where gain is before thee. If
thy resolutions have been or are, according to the common guise of the world,
Hor. 1. Ep. 1. Vnde habeat quaerit nemo, sed oportet haber^. Juvenal. Sat. ^4
ex Enn^o.
Quocunque modo rem, to gain and gather treasure, and to feather thy nest
whether by right or wrong; If thou have adventured to increase thy substance by
bribery, or forgery, by usury and extortion, by sacrilegiously detaining or
invading the Churches patrimony, by griping and wringing excessive fees from
poor men, by delays of justice, by racking of Rents to an unreasonable
proportion, by false weights and measures, and lies, and oaths; If thou poverty
or simplicity, or to make advantage of thy own either power to oppress him, or
cunning to circumvent him: be not too confident of thy learning in this Art.
Injustice and Contentment cannot certainly stand together.

16. Neither secondly has he attained to any good degree of thoughts are too
intent upon, and whose desires too eager after, the things of earth: although
he should not attempt the compassing thereof by any other then lawful means
only. A greedy eye, and a craving heart, importunately -- argenti sitis
importuna, fames^^. Horat. 1. Epist. 18.
hungring and thirsting after the Mammon of unrighteousness, (whereas the
hunger and thirst of a through-Christian should be after Christ and the
righteousness of his kingdom) is a certain symptom of a mind not truly
contented. Mat. 5.6.
And so are those carking and disquieting cares likewise, which our Savior so
much condemns Mat. 6. The Apostle therefore so speaks of Covetousness and
Contentment, Heb. 13.5.
Let your conversation be without covetousness, says he, and be content with
such things as ye have, Heb. 13. (...) and (...), a studious care to walk
faithfully and diligently in the duties of our vocations; and a moderate desire
of bettering our estates by our providence in a fair way without the injuring
of others: and are not lawful and expedient in themselves, but are also good
signs of a contented mind, yea and good helps withal to the attainment of a
farther degree of Contentment. But (...) and (...), a desire that will not be
confined within reasonable bounds; and a sollicitous anxious care, taking
thought for the success of our affairs: are the rank weeds of an earthly mind,
and evident signs of the want of true Contentment.

17. And so is also thirdly, that pinching and penurious humor; which, because
it is an evidence of a heart wretchedly set upon the world, we commonly call
miserableness, and the persons so affected Misers. When a man cannot find in
his heart to take part of that which God sends, for his own moderate comfort,
and for the convenient sustenance of his family, and of those that belong to
him, estate and rank. Servorum ventres modio castigat iniquo,
Juvenal satyr. 14.
Ipse quoque esuriens --
For whereas the contented man, that which he has not he wants not; Avaro
tam deest. quod habet, quam quod non habet.
because he can live without it: this wretch on the contrary wants even that
which he has; because he lives beside it. He that is truly contented with
what God has lent him for his portion, can be also well content to use it as
becomes him, and as his occasions (...). Anthol. 2.50.
the use not the bare possession. Not that the owner should behold it with his
eyes, and then neither receive farther good from it, nor do farther good with
it: but that it should be used and employed to the glory of the giver, Eccles 5
11.
and the comfort of the receiver and others, with all thankfulness, and
sobriety, and Charity.

18. And do we not also fourthly too often and too evidently bewray the
discontentedness of our minds, by our murmuring and repining at the ways of
Gods providence in the dispensation of these outward things, when at any time
they fall out cross to our desires or expectations. The Israelites of old were
much to blame this way, and the Lord often plagued them for it: insomuch that
the Apostle proposes their punishment as a monitory example for all others to
take warning by 1 Cor. 10. Neither murmr ye, 1 Cor. 10.10.
as some of them murmured; and were destroyed of the destroyer. In Egypt, where
they meat enough, they murmured for want of liberty: and in the wilderness,
where they had liberty enough, they murmured for want of meat. There, Exodus
1.14.
by reason of the hard bondage they were in under Pharaoh and his cruel
officers, they would have exchanged their very lives (had it been possible) for
a little Liberty. Here, when they wanted either bread, or water, or flesh, --
16.3. and Numb. 11 5.
they would have exchanged their liberty again for the Onions and Garlike and
fleshpots of Egypt. Like wayward children, that are never well, full nor
fasting, but always wrangling; so were they. And as they were then, so have
ever since been, and still are, the greatest part of mankind: holy learning.
Whereas he that is well versed in this Art of Contentation, is ever like
himself; the same full and fasting: always quiet, and always thankful.

19. Ey and charitable too, in the dispensation of the temporals God has
bestowed upon him, for the comfortable relief of the poor distressed members
of Jesus Christ: which is another good sign of a Contented mind. For what
should make him sparing to them, who fears no want for himself? As the godly
man is described in Psalm. 112. His heart is fixed, and established, Psalm.
112.7, 8.
and his trust is in the Lord: and thence it is that he is so cheerfully
disposed to -- 9.
Some boast of their Contentedness, as other some do of their Religiousness:
and both upon much like slender grounds. They, because they live of their own,
and do no man wrong: these, because they frequent the house of God, and the
holy assemblies. Good things they are both, none doubts; and necessary
appendices (respectively) of those two great virtues: for certainly that man
cannot be, either truly Contented that does not the one, or truly Religious
that neglects the other. But yet, as certain it is, that no man has either
more Contentment, or more Religion, then he has Charity. You then contented or
religious; now if ever show the truth of your Contentation, and the power of
your Religion, by the works of Mercy and Compassion. The times are hard, by the
just judgment of God upon a thankless Nation: and thousands now are pinched
with famine and want, who were able in some measure, and in their low
condition, to sustain themselves opportunity which he has put into your hands,
the Lord has put you to the test and to the trial: and he now expects (and
so does the world too) that if you have either of those graces in you, which
you pretend to, you should manifest the fruits of them, by refreshing the
bowels of the needy. If now you draw back, and do not (according to your
abilities and the necessities of the times) seriously and seasonably bring
forth out of your treasures, and dispense out of your abundance, and that with
more then ordinary liberality, somewhat for the succor of those that stand in
extreme need: how dwells the love of God in you? how Contentedness, or make
semblance of Religion? Pure Religion and undefiled before God and the Father is
this; to visit the fatherless and widows in their afflictions, Jam 1.27.
and to keep ones self unspotted of the World. The same will serve as one good
(...) among others, whereby to make trial of the truth of our Contentedness
also.

20. Lastly, it is a good sign of Contentedness, when a man that has any
while enjoyed Gods blessings with comfort, can be content to part with them
quietly and with patience, when the Lord calls for them back again. The
things we have, are not (properly) data, but commodata. When God lent us the
use of them, he had the property too: and therefore they are his goods still,
and he may require them at our hands, or take them from us when he will, and
dispose of them as he pleases. I will return, and take away my corn and my
wine in the season thereof, and will recover my wool and my flax. Osee. 2.9.
Osee 2. What we have, we hold of him as our creditor and: when he committed
these things to our trust, they were not made over to us by covenant for any
fixed term. Whenever therefore he shall think good to call in his debts; it
is our part to return them: with patience shall I say? ey and with thankfulness
too, that he has suffered us to enjoy them so long; but without the least
grudging or repining (as too often Non contristor, quod recepisti: ago gratias,
quod dedisti. Thus did Job: when all was taken from him, he blessed the name of
the Lord still; and to his wife tempting him to impatience, gave a sharp, but
withal a most reasonable and religious answer, Job. 1.21.
Thou speak like a foolish woman: Shall we receive good things at the hand
of God, and shall we not receive evil also? -- 2.10.
As who say, shall we make earnest suite to him when we would borrow* and be
offended with him, when we are called on to pay again? We account him (and so
he is,) an ill and unthankful debtor, from whom the lender cannot ask his own,
but he shall be like to lose a friend by it. Add yet how impatiently oftentimes
do we take it at our Lords hand, when he requires from us but some small part
of that which he has so freely, and so long lent us?

21. Try thy self then, Brother, by these and the like signs: progress thou
have made, in this so high and useful a part of Christian learning. 1. If thou
scornest to gain by any unlawful or unworthy means; 2. If thy desires and
cares for the things of this life be regular and moderate; 3. If thou can
find in thy heart to take thy portion and to bestow thereof for thine own
comfort. 4. And to dispense (though but) the superfluities for the charitable
relief of thy poor neighbors; 5. If thou can want what thou desire without
murmuring, and lose what thou possessest without impatience: then may thou
with some confidence say with our Apostle in the Text, (...), I have learned in
whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content. But if any one signs be wholly
wanting in thee, thou art then but a truant in this learning: and it will
concern thee to set so much the harder to it, and to apply thy self more
seriously and diligently to this study hereafter, then hitherto thou have done.

22. Wherein for the better guiding of those that are desirous of this
learning; either to make entrance thereinto, if they be yet altogether to
learn, which may be the case of some of us; or to proceed farther therein if
they be already entered, as the best-skilled of us all had need to do: (for so
long as we are in the flesh, and live in the world, the lusts both of flesh and
world will mingle a fullness of perfection:) I shall crave leave, toward the
close of this discourse, to commend to the consideration and practice of all,
whether novices or proficients in this Art of Contentation, some useful Rules
that may serve as so many helps for their better attaining to some reasonable
abilities therein. The general means for the obtaining of this, as of every
other particular grace, we all know are fervent Prayer, and the sincere love of
God and goodness. Which because they are general, we will not now particularly
insist upon: it shall suffice, without farther opening, barely to have
mentioned them.

special means; the first thing to be done is to labor for a true and lively
Faith. For Faith is the very basis, the foundation, (...).
Heb. 11.1.
whereupon our hearts and all our hearts-content must rest: the whole frame of
our contentment, rising higher or lower; weaker or stronger, in proportion to
that foundation. And this Faith, as to our present purpose, has a double
Object, (as before was touched:) to wit, the Goodness of God, and the Truth of
God. His Goodness, in the dispensation of his special providence for the
present: and his Truth, in the performance of his temporal promises for the
future. First then, labor to have thy heart thoroughly the goodness of God
toward thee: That he is thy Father, and that whether he frown upon thee, or
correct thee, or howsoever otherwise he seem to deal with thee, he still
bears a Fatherly affection toward thee; That what he gives thee he gives
in love, because he sees it best for thee to have it; and what he denies
thee, he denies in love, because he sees it best for thee to want it. A sick
man in the extremity of his distemper, desires some of those that are about
him and sit at his bedside, as they love him, to give him a draught of cold
water to allay his thirst: but cannot obtain it from his dearest wife that
lies in his bosom, nor from his nearest friend that loves him as his own
soul. They consider, that if they should satisfy his desire, they should
destroy his life: they will therefore rather urge him, and even compel him, to
take what the Doctor has prescribed, how unpleasant and distastful soever it
may seem unto him. And then if pain and the impotency of his desire will but
permit him reason; he yields to their persuasions: for then he considers,
that all this is done out of their love to him, and for his good, both when he
is denied what he most desires, and when he is pressed to take what he
vehemently abhors. Persuade thy self in like sort of all the Lords dealings
with thee. If at any time he do not answer thee in the desire of thy heart:
conclude, there is either some unworthiness in thy person, or some inordinacy
in thy desire, or some unfitness or unseasonableness in the thing desired;
something or other not right on thy part; but be sure not to impute it to any
defect of love in him.

24. And as thou art steadfastly to believe his goodness and love, in ordering
all things in such sort as he does for the present: so his truth and
faithfulness for the making good of all those gracious promises that he has
made in his word concerning thy temporal provision and preservation for the
future. Only understand those promises rightly, with their due conditions and
limitations, and in that sense wherein he intended them, when he made them: and
then never doubt the performance. For say in good sooth, art thou able to
charge him with any breach of promise hitherto? Have thou ever found, that he
has dealt unfaithfully with thee? or did thou ever hear that he unfaithfully
with any other? There is no want of Power in him, that he should not be as big
as his word; there it no want of love in him, that he should not be as good as
his word. He is not as man that he should repent, or as the son of man, that he
should call back his word. Numb. 23 9.
There is no lightness or inconstancy in him, that there should he Yea and Nay
in his promises; but they are all Yea and Amen. 2 Cor. 1.19, 20
Thy heart can tell thee, thou have often broken vow and promise with him, and
dealt unfaithfully in his covenant: but do not offer him that indignity, in
addition to all thy other injuries, as to measure him by thy self, to judge of
his dealings by thine, and altogether such a one as thy self, so false, so
fickle, so uncertain, Psalm. 50.21.
as thou art. Far be all such thoughts from every one of us. Though we deny
him; 2 Timothy 2.12, 13.
yet he abides faithful, and will not, cannot deny himself. We are fleeting
and mutable, off and on, to day not the same we were yesterday, and to morrow
perhaps like neither Ego Deus and non mutor) he continues yesterday, to day,
and the same for ever. Mal. 3.6. Heb. 13.8.
Roll thy self then upon his providence, and repose thy self with assured
confidence upon his promises: and Contentment will follow. Upon this base the
Apostle has bottomed Contentation, Heb. 13.5.
Heb. 13. -- be content with such things as ye have: for he has said, I will
never leave thee, nor forsake thee.

25. The next thing we are to look after in this business, is Humilty, and
Poverty of spirit. It is our pride most, that undoeth us: much of our
discontent springs from it. We think highly of our selves: thence our envy,
fretting and pining away, when deserve not much better then we do, to have yet
much more then we have; wealth, honor, power, ease, reputation, any thing.
Pride and Beggary sort ill together; even in our own judgments; so hateful a
thing is a proud beggar in the opinion of the world, that proverbs have grown
from it. We think he better deserves the stocks or the whip, then an alms,
that beggeth at our doors, and yet takes scornfully what is given him, if it
be not of the best in the house. Can we hate this in others toward our selves,
and yet be so blinded with pride and self-love, as not to in our selves toward
our good God? Extremely beggarly we are. Annon mendicus, qui panem petis? Job
1.21.
Are we not very beggars, that came naked into the world, 1 Timothy 6.7.
and must go naked out of it? that brought nothing along with us at our coming,
Mat. 6.11.
and it is certain we shall carry nothing away with us at our departure? Are we
not arrant beggars, that must beg, and that daily, for our daily bread? And yet
are we also extremely Proud: and take the alms, that God thinks fit to
bestow upon us, in great snuff, if it be not every way to our liking. Alas!
what could we look for, if God should give us but what we deserve? Did we but
well consider our own unworthiness; it would enforce an acknowledgment from us,
like that of Jacob, That we are far less then the least of his mercies, etc.
Genesis 32.10.
We are not worthy so much as to gather up the crumbs under his table, as our
dogs do under ours; who far better deserve it at our hands, then we do at his.
Our hands did not make them nor fashion them: yet they love us, and follow us,
and guard our houses, and do us pleasures and services many other ways. But
we, although we are his creatures, and the workmanship of his hands, yet do
nothing (as of our selves) but hate him, and dishonor him, and rebel against
him, and by most unworthy provocations daily and minutely good thing then can
we deserve at his hands? rather what evil thing do we not deserve, if he should
render to us according as we deal with him: Why should we then be displeased
with any of his dispensations? Having deserved nothing, we may very well hold
our selves content with any thing.

26. A Third help unto Contentation is, to set a just valuation the things we
have. We commonly have our eye upon those things we desire, and set so great a
price upon them; that the over-valuing of what we have in chase and
expectation, makes us as much under-value what we have in present possession.
An infirmity, to which the best of the faithful, ( the father of the faithful,
not excepted,) are subject. It was the speech of no worse a man then Abraham, O
Lord says he, what will thou give me, seeing I go childless? Genesis 15.2.
As if he had said, All this great increase of cattle and abundance of treasure
which thou have given me, avail me nothing; so long as I have never a child to
leave it to. It differs Haman, All this avails me nothing, Est. 5.13.
so long as I see Mordecay etc. save that Abraham's speech proceeded from the
weakness of his Faith at that time and under that temptation; and Hamans from
habitual infidelity, and a heart totally carnal. It is the admirable goodness
of a gracious God, that he accepts the faith of his poor servants be it never
so small; and passes by the defects thereof; be they never so great: Only it
should be our care, not to flatter our selves so far, as to cherish those
infirmities, or allow our selves therein; but rather to strive against them
with our utmost strength, that we may what we have, and could not well be
without; as upon what we fain would have, but might want. The things the Lord
has already lent thee: consider how useful they are to thee; how beneficial;
how comfortable; how ill thou could spare them; how much worse thou should
be then now thou art without them; how many men in the world that want what
thou enjoyest, would be glad with all their hearts to exchange for it that
which thou so much desire. And let these considerations prevail with thee,
both to be thankful for what God has been pleased already to give thee, and to
be content to want what it is his pleasure yet to from thee.

27. Another help for the same purpose fourthly is, to compare our selves and
our estates rather with those that are below us, then with those that are above
us. We love comparisons but too well, unless we could make better use of them.
We run over all our neighbors in our thoughts: and when we have so done, we
make our comparisons so untowardly, that there is no neighbor we have, but (as
we handle the matter) we are the worse for him: We find in him something or
other, that serves as fuel either to Pride, or Incharitableness, or other
corrupt lust. We look at our poorer neighbor: and because we are richer then
he, we cast a scornful eye upon him, and in the pride of our hearts despise
him. We look at our richer neighbor: and because we are not so full as he, we
cast an envious eye at him, and out of the uncharitableness malice him. Thus
unhappily do we misplace our thoughts, or mis-apply them; and whatsoever the
pr^mises are, draw wretched conclusions from them: as the spider is said to
suck poison out of every flower. Whereas sanctified wisdom, if it might be
heard, would rather teach us to make a holy advantage of such like comparisons,
for the increase of some precious graces in us; and namely those two of
Thankfulness and Contentedness: as the^ Be gathers honey out of every weed.
And the course is this. Observe thy present corruption what ever it be, when it
begins to stir within thee: and then make the comparison so, as may best
serve the temptation arising from that lust. As for example. When thou find
thy self apt to magnify and exalt thy self in thine own greatness, and puffed up
with the conceit of some excellency (whether real or but imaginary) in thy
self, to swell above thy meaner brethren: then look upwards, and thou shall see
perhaps hundreds above thee, that have somewhat that thou have not. It may be,
the comparing of thy self with them may help to allay the swelling, and reduce
thee to a more sober and humble temper. But when on the other side, thou
find thy self apt to grudge at the prosperity of others, and to murmr at
the scantness of thine own portion: then look downwards, and thou shall see
perhaps -- neque se majori pauperiorium Turbae comparet: hunc atque hunc
superare laboret. Hor. 1. Sermon. 1.
thousands thee, that want something that thou have. It may be, the comparing
thy self with them, may help to silence all those repining thoughts and
obmurmurations against the wise dispensations of Almighty God. For tell me, why
should one or two richer neighbors be such a grievous eyesore to thee, to
provoke thy discontent: rather then ten or twenty poorer ones a spurr to
quicken thee to thankfulness? If Reason by the instigation of corrupt nature
can teach thee to argue thus, my house, my farm, my stock, my wbole condition
is naught; many a man has better: why should not Reason heightened by Gods
grace teach thee as well to argue thus,

28. Fifthly for the getting of Contentment, it would not a little avail us, to
consider the unsufficiency of those things, the want whereof now discontenteth
us, to give us content if we should obtain them. Not only for that reason, that
as the things increase, our desires also increase with them; (which yet is most
true, and of very important consideration too; as Solomon says, Eccles. 5.10.
(He that loves silver, shall not be satisfied with silver:) but for a farther
reason also, because with the best conveniences of this life, there are
interwoven sundry inconveniences withal; which for the most in chase, but we
shall be sure to find them at length in the possession and use. Whilst we are
in the pursuit of any thing, we think over and over how beneficial it may be to
us, and we promise to our selves much good from: and our thoughts are so taken
up with such meditations, that we consider it abstractedly discommodiousnesses
and encombrances, which yet inseparably cleave thereunto. But when we have
gotten what we so importunely desired, and think to enter upon the enjoyment;
we then begin to find those discommodiousnesses and encombrances which before
we never thought of, as well as those services and advantages which we expected
from it. Now if we could be so wise and provident before hand, as to forethink
and forecast the inconveniences as well as the usefulness of those things we
seek after: it would certainly bring our desires to better moderation; work in
us a just dis-estimation of these earthly things which we usually overprize;
contented, if we must go without them. O miserum pan^um? as he said of his
diadem. What a glorious luster does the Imperial Crown make, to dazzle the eyes
of the beholders, and to tempt ambition to wade even through a sea of blood,
and stretch it self beyond all the lines of justice and religion to get within
the reach of it? yet did a man but know what legions of fears and cares, like
so many restless spirits, are incircled within that narrow round: he could not
be excused from the extremity of madness, if he should much envy him that wore
it; much less if he should by villainy or bloodshed aspire to it. When Damocles
had -- fulgentem gladium seta equin^ appensum. Cic. 5. Tusc. quaest.
the sword hanging over his head in a twine-thread, delicacies that stood
before him upon the board, which a little before he deemed -- negaret^, unquam
quenquam beatiorem fuisse. -- ibid.
the greatest happiness the world could afford. There is nothing under the
Sun, but is full, not of vanity only, but also of vexation. Why then should we
not be well content to be without that thing, (if it be the Lords will we
should want it:) which we cannot have without much vanity, and some vexation
withal.

29. In the sixth place a notable help to Contentment is Sobriety: under which
name I comprehend both Frugality and Temperance. Frugality is of very
serviceable use, partly to the acquiring, partly Magnificence, Justice,
Liberality, Thankfulness, etc. and this of Contentation among the rest. Hardly
can that man be, either truly thankful unto God, or much helpful to his
friends, or do any great matters in the way of charity and to pious uses, or
keep touch in his promises and pay every man his own, (as every honest man
should do) nor live a contented life: that is not frugall. We all cry out
against Covetousness (and that justly) as a base sin, the cause of many evils
and mischiefs, and a main opposite to Contentment. But truly, if things be
rightly considered, we shall find Prodigality to Contentedness. For
Contentedness (as the very name gives it, (...), a self-sufficiency)
consists in the mutual and relative sufficiency, of the things unto the mind,
and of the mind Where Covetousness reigns in the heart, the mind is too
narrow for the things: and where the estate is profusely wasted, the things
must needs be too scant for the mind. So that -- Ille sinistrorsum, hic
dextrorsum abit: u^us utrique Error, sed variis illudit partibus. Horat. 2.
satyr. 3.
the disproportion is still the same, though it arise not from the same
principle. As in many other things we may observe an unhappy coincidence of
extremes: contrary causes, for different reasons, producing one and the same
evil effect. -- brumae penetrabile frigus adurit. Virgil. 1. Georg.
Extreme cold parcheth the grass, as well as extreme heat: and lines drawn from
the opposite parts of the circumference meet in the Center. Although the
prodigal man therefore utterly disclaim Covetousness, and Covetous; and
transgresses the Commandment which says, Thou shall not covet, as much as
the most covetous wretch in the world does. The difference is but this: the one
coveteth, that he may have it, the other coveteth, that he may spend it; as St
James says, He coveteth that he may consume it upon his lusts. He that will
fare deliciously every day; James 4.3.
or carry a great port in the world, and maintain a numerous family of idle and
unnecessary dependants; or adventure great sums in gaming or upon matches; or
bring up his children too highly; or any other his expenses beyond the
proportion of his revenues: it is impossible but he should desire means
wherewithal to maintain the charges he must be at for the aforesaid ends.
Which since his proper revenues (according to our supposition) will not reach
to do: his wits are set on work how to compass supplies and to make it out, out
of other men's estates. Hence he is driven to succor himself by frauds and
oppressions, and all those other evils that spring from the root of
covetousness. 1 Timothy 6.10.
And when these also fail (as hold they cannot long;) there is then no remedy,
but he must live the remainder of his days upon borrowing and shifting: debts
and dangers, loses his credit or liberty or both, and creates to him a world
of discontents. He that would live a contented life, and bear a contented mind,
it stands him upon to be Frugal.

30. Temperance also is of right good use to the same end: that is to say, a
moderate use at all times, and now and then a voluntary forbearance of, and
abstinence from the Creatures, when we might lawfully use them. If we would
sometimes deny our appetites in the use of meats, and drinks, and sleep, and
sports, and other comforts and refreshments of this life; and exercise our
selves fastings and watchings, and other hardnesses and austerities (St Paul's
(...), and (...): 1 Cor. 9.27. 1 Timothy 4.8.
) we should be the better able sure to undergo them stoutly, and grudg and
shrink less under them, if at any time hereafter by any accident or affliction
we should be hard put to it. We should in all likelihood be the better content
to want many things when we cannot have them: if we would now and then inure
our selves, to be as if we wanted we have them.

31. Lastly, (for I may not enlarge) that meditation, which was so frequent
with the godly Fathers under both Testaments, (and whereof the more sober sort
among the heathens had some glimmering light,) That we have here no abiding
City, but seek one to come; Heb. 13.14. 1 Pet. 2.11.
That we are here but as strangers and pilgrims in a foreign land, heaven
being our home; and that our continuance in this world, is but as the lodging
of a traveler in an Inn for a night: this meditation I say, if followed home,
would much further us in the present learning. The Apostle seems to We
brought nothing into this world, 1 Timothy 6.7, 8.
and it is certain we can carry nothing out: and thence infers in the very
next words, Having food and raiment let us be therewith content. We forget our
selves very much, when we fancy to our selves a kind of perpetuity here, as if
our houses should continue for ever, Psalm. 49.11.
and our dwelling places should remain from one generation to another. We think
it good being here; here we would build us Tabernacles, set up our rest here.
And that is it, that makes us so greedy after the things that belong hither,
and so sullen and discomposed when our endeavors in the pursuit of them prove
successless. Whereas if we would the world is, and what our selves are; the
world but an Inn, and our selves but passengers: it would fashion us to more
moderate desires, and better composed affections. In our Innes we would be glad
to have wholesome diet, clean lodging, diligent attendamce, and all other things
with convenience and to our liking. But yet we will be wary what we call for;
that we exceed not too much, lest the reckoning prove too sharp afterward: and
if such things as we are to make use of there, we find not altogether as we
would wish, we do not much trouble our selves at it, but for a night; We shall
be able sure to make shift with mean accommodations, for one night; we shall be
at home ere it be long, where we can mend our selves, and have things more to
our own hearts-content. Satiabor cum apparuerit gloria. The plenteousness of
that house, when we shall arrive at our own home, will fully satiate our
largest desires. In the mean time let the expectation of that fullness, and the
approach of our departure out of this sorry Inn, sustain our souls with
comfort against all the emptinesses of this world, and whatsoever we meet with
in vexation or discontent: that we may learn with S. Paul in whatsoever estate
we are, to be therewith content. God vouchsafe this to us all for his Dear Sons
sake Jesus Christ etc.

Sense. The speech it self presents to our view a Sale, and a Redemption: and
under those Metaphors, represents to our thoughts, Man's inexcusable baseness
and Folly in the Sale; Gods admirable power and goodness in the Redemption. The
most wretched Sale that ever was; all passed away, and nothing coming But the
most blessed Redemption that ever was; all fetched back again, and nothing laid
out. A Sale, without any profit to us; it got us naught: in the former part of
the verse, (You have sold your selves for naught). A Redemption without any
charge to us; it cost us naught: in the latter part, ( ye shall be redeemed
without money.) These are the two points we are to hold us to at this time: the
Sale first, by Sin; and then the Redemption by Christ.

2. You have sold your selves for naught.] Words not many in our Translations;
But in the Original, (as also in the Greek) as few as can be to be a Number,
but two: Yet do they fairly yield us The Act: and that is a Bargain of Sale,
(ye have sold) 2. The Object of that Act; the Commodity, or thing sold, and
that is themselves, ( sold your selves.) 3. The Consideration, or Price; (if
you will allow that Name to a thing of no Price:) and that is nothing, or as
good as nothing, ( sold for naught.) 4. The Agent, the Merchant or Salesman:
and that is themselves too, (Ye have sold your selves.) To sell, and that
themselves; and that for naught; and to do all this, themselves: of these in
order.

3. The Act is first; it is a Bargain of Sale: (Ye have sold your If we had but
deposited our selves with Satan, being so perfidious as he is; it had been
hazard enough, and but too much. For even among Men, if the party that is
trusted, have but the Conscience to deny the trust, and the face to forswear
it: he that trusts him may soon come to lose all. But yet in point of right,
and to common entendment, he that depositeth any thing in the hand of another,
does only commit it to his custody: both Rei depositae proprietas apud
deponentem man^t. l. 17. F. depositi, vel contra.
property and use still reserved to himself. 2. In a Demise a man parts with
more of his interest; he transmitteth together with the possession, the use
also or fruit of the thing letten or demised, so as the ususructuarius tenant
may during his Term use it at his Pleasure, and (so far as he is not limited
by special Covenant) make benefit of it to his own most advantage. But here is
yet no Alienation: it is but jus utendi salva substantia. Still the Property
remains where it was: and the Possession too after a time, and when the term
is expired, reverteth to the first owner. 3. A Mortgage indeed has in it
something of the Nature of an Alienation: in as much as it passes over
Alienatio est omnis actus, per quem dominium transfertur.
Dominium, as well as Rem, and Usumfructum; that is property, and (as you would
say) Ownership, as well as Possession, Use, and Benefit. Yet not absolutely any
of these; but with a defeisance, a Condition performable by himself, so as the
Mortgage is upon the point the proprietary still, if he will himself: because
it is in his own power by performing the Condition to make a defeisance of his
former act, and consequently to make the alienation void, and then he is in
statu quo.

Bargain of Sale there is a great deal more then in all these. There Venditio
alienatio est re^ suae, jurisque in ea sui in alium translatio. Senec. 5. de
benef. 10. (...). Suid. in (...).
the Alienation is absolute, and the contract Peremptory. Wherein the Seller
transferreth and makes over to the Buyer, together with the Possession, use
and profits, the very property also of the thing sold; with all his right,
title, claim, and interest therein for ever, without power of revocation, or
any other reservation whatsoever. And this is our Case: this the fact, whereof
we stand indicted in the Text. What the Scripture charge upon Ahab for his
particular, that he had sold himself to work wickedness: is (though not in the
same height of sense, yet) in some degree, all Mankind. 3 King. 21.25.
We have all sold our selves to Sin and Satan. Venundati sub peccato, says St
Paul; and he seems to speak it of the better sort of Men too (in the judgment
of many good interpreters) Romans 7. And then how much more is it true of the
rest? that they are Carnal, Romans 7.14.
sold under sin.

5. The greater is our Misery, and the more our Presumption: which are the two
Inferences hence. Our Misery first. For by selling ourselves over to sin and
Satan, we have put our selves out of our own, into their Dominion: and (during
that state) remain wholly to be disposed at their pleasure. They are now become
Lords; and it is not for us to refuse any drudgery, be it never so toilsome or
irksome, whereabout they shall list to employ us. How should it else be
possible for men endowed with reason, some to melt themselves away in Luxury
and Brutish sensuality, as the Voluptuous; othersome to pine themselves lean
with looking at the fatness of another portion, as the Envious; othersome to
run themselves out of breath, sometimes till they burst, in the pursuit either
of shadows, as the Ambitious; or of smoke, as the Popular or vainglorious;
othersome, like those that in old time were damnati ad Metalla, to moyl
perpetually in lading themselves with thick clay, the Covetous? were it not
that they are put upon such drudgeries, by their imperious Masters; Sin, who
reigns like a tyrant in their mortal Bodies, and will have all his lust
obeyed: Romans 6.12.
and Satan who grown great by this new purchase (for by it it is that he
claims to be Prince of the world) sits in the hearts of ungodly men, as in
his Throne, and there commands like an Emperor: John 16.11.
and who may be so bold as to contradict, or but to say, Domine cur ita facis?
Acti agimus, is a true saying, in this sense howsoever. He must needs go, we
say, whom the Devil drives: and St Paul says, Ephesians. 2.1.
he is It is but an empty flourish then, that licentious men sometimes stand so
much upon their liberty; saying with them John 8. we were always free, and
were never in bondage unto any; or with them in Psalm 12. John 8.33. Psalm 12.4.
Our lips are our own, who is Lord over us? who is Lord over you, do you say?
No hard matter to tell you that: Even Satan. your lips and tongues are his;
your hearts and your hands his; your bodies, and your souls his; all you have,
all you are, wholly and entirely his. You have sold your selves to him, and
Emptum cedit in jus emptoris. He has bought you, and his you are, to have and
to hold: he may now do what he will with you, (if Non miror quod Diabolus istud
potuit: sed quod Deus permisit. Bern. Epist. 141.
God suffer him) and you must abide it. This being the case of us all by reason
of Sin (till we be restored by Grace,) I need say no more to let us see, what
misery we have pulled upon our selves by this Sale.

6. But there is another thing too in this Sale. besides our Misery meet for us
to take knowledge of: and that is our high Presumption, joined with extreme
injustice and unthankfulness. God made us to do him service: and his we are;
his Creatures, his Servants. Now then Quis tu? What have thou to do to judge,
says S. Paul: may not I say much more, what have thou to do to sell another
servant? Romans 14.4.
and that invito, nay inconsulto Domini; without any License of Alienation from
the chief Lord, nay without so much as ever asking his consent: If God were
pleased to leave us at first in manu consilij, and to trust us so far as to
commit the keeping of our selves to our selves: he had no meaning therein to
turn us loose, neither to quit his own right to us and our to oblige us so much
the more unto himself, by making us his depositaries in a trust of that nature?
As if a King should commit to one of his meanest servants, the custody of some
of his Royal houses or forts, he should by that very trust lay a new obligation
upon him of fealty, over and above that common allegiance which he owes him as
a Subject. Now if such a servant, so entrusted by the King his Master, should
then take upon him of his own head without his Masters privity, to contract
with a stranger, perhaps a Rebel or Enemy, for the passing over the said house
or fort into his ingratitude, injustice, and presumption, in the highest
degree? Yet is our injustice, ingratitude, and presumption, by so much more
infinitely heinous then his, in selling our selves from God our Lord and Master
into the hands of Satan a Rebel, and an Enemy to God and all goodness: By how
much the disparity is infinitely more betwixt the eternal God and the greatest
of the sons of Men, then betwixt the highest Monarch in the world, and the
lowest of his Subjects.

7. So much for the Act: the other particulars belong to it a Sale they say
three things are required, Res, Precium, and Consensus: a Commodity to be sold,
a Price to be pai'd, and consent of Parties. Here they are all. And whereas I
told you in the beginning, that in this Sale was represented to us Man's
inexcusable baseness and folly; You shall now three several Circumstances. In
the Commodity our Baseness; that we should sell away our very selves: in the
Price our folly; that we should do it for a thing of naught: in the Consent our
inexcusableness in both; that an act so base and foolish should yet be our own
voluntary act and deed. And first for the Commodity. (You have sold your
selves.)

8. Lands, Houses, Cattle, and other like possessions made for man's use, are
the proper subject matter of trade and commerce; and so are fit to pass from
man to man by Sales and other Contracts. But that Man a Creature of such
excellency, stamped with the endowed with a reasonable soul, made capable of
grace and Glory, should Prost^are in foro, become merchantable ware, and be
chaffered in the markets and fayres: I suppose had bin a thing never heard of
in the world to this hour; had not the overflowings of pride, and Cruelty, and
Covetousness, washed out of the hearts of Men, the very impressions both of
Religion and Humanity. It is well, and we are to bless God, and under God to
thank our Christian Religion and pious Governors for it; that in these times
and parts of the world, we scarce know what it means. But that it was
generally practiced all the world over in Turks and Pagans, to sell men:
ancient Histories and modern relations will not suffer us to be ignorant. We
have mention of such Sales even in Scripture, where we read of some that sold
their own brother, as Jacobs sons did Joseph; and of one that sold his own
Master, Genesis 37.^8. Matthew. 26.15.
as the traitor Judas did Christ. Basely and wretchedly both: Envy made them
base; and Covetousness him. Only in some cases of Necessity, as for the
preservation of Life, or of liberty of Conscience, when other means fail, God
permitted to his own people to sell themselves or Children into perpetual
bondage; and Moses Laws and Ordinances touching that Matter, Levit. 25.

9. But between the Sale in the Text, and all those other, there are two main
differences: Both which do exceedingly aggravate our baseness. The first that
no man could honestly sell another, nor would any man willingly sell himself,
unless enforced thereunto by some urgent necessity. But what necessity I pray
you, that we should sell our selves out of Gods and out of our own hands into
the hands of Sin and Satan? Were we not well enough before? sull enough, and
safe enough? Was our Masters service so hard Lived? Yea and that happily, and
freely, and plentifully, and that for ever in his service? What was it then?
Even as it is with many fickle servants abroad in the world, that begin in a
good service, cannot tell when they are well, but must be ever and anon
flitting, though many times they change for the worse: so it was only our Pride
and folly, and a fond conceit we had of bettering our condition thereby, that
made us not only without any apparent necessity, but even against all good
reason and duty, thus basely to desert our first service, and to sell our
selves for bondslaves to Sin and Satan.

10. The other difference makes the matter yet a great deal worse on our side.
For in selling of slaves, for so much as bodily service was the thing chiefly
looked after; therefore as the body in respect of strength, health, age, and
other abilities was deemed more or less fit for service, the price was commonly
proportioned Grecians, (...) etc. Anthol. 1.12.
slaves were called (...), that is, bodies; and they that traded in that kind
(...). Chrysostom. 1 Cor. ser. 40. v. Rad. Homer. 2. ver. quotid. 26. and Casaub. in
Athen. 5.10. Rev. 18.13. Epiphan. in Ancorat. Plato.
(...), as you would say merchants of bodies. And so the word (...) is rendered
Rev. 18. Mancipia or slaves. Epiphanius gives us the reason of that use of the
word, (...), says he etc. because all the command that a man can exercise over
his slaves, is terminated to the body, and cannot reach the soul. And the
soul is the better part of man; and that by so many degrees better, that in
comparison thereof the body has been scarce accounted a considerable part.
(...), could the Greek Philosopher say, and the Latin Cicer in Somn. Scip.
Men's cujusque is est quisque. The soul is in effect the whole man; -- corpus
quasi vas est, aut aliquod animi receptaculum Cic. 1. Tuscul. -- (...). Chrysostom.
Mat.16.26. in Math. ser. 34. Luke 9.25.
The body but the shell of him: the body but the casket, the soul the Jewel.
It is observable, that whereas we read Matthew. 16. ( What shall it profit a man,
if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul?) in stead thereof we have it
Luke. 9. thus, ( if he gain the whole world and lose himself?) So that every
man's soul is himself; and the body but -- videt enim -- appendicem animi esse
corpus. Cicer. apud Nonnium in Appendix.
an appurtenance of him. Yet such is our baseness, that we have thus trucked
away our selves with the appurtenances; that is, both our souls and our
bodies. We detest Witches and Conjurers (and that worthily) as wicked and base
contract with the Devil. Yet have our rebellions against God put us in the
same predicament with them. Verily Rebellion is as witchcraft. 1 Samuel 15. Ours
is so: since by it we have made a Contract with the Devil, and sold our selves
to him, souls and all.

1 Samuel 15.23.
11. Yet are base-minded people most an end covetous enough: they will hardly
part with any thing, but they will know for what. Ecquid erit precij? What will
you give me? is a ready Question in every man's mouth that offers to sell.
Joseph's brethren, though Genesis 37.28. Mat. 26.15. Amos. 2.6.
yet would have somewhat for him: and Judas would not be a Traitor for naught.
They got twenty pieces of silver for their Brother, and he thirty for his
Master. And those oppressors in Amos 2. that sold the needy for a pair of would
be content with a small matter, so they might be on the taking hand. Esau had a
very sorry recompense, Heb. 12.16.
a morsel of meat and a mess of broth, for his own birthright and his fathers
blessing: yet that was something ( jus pro jure) and something we say, has
some savor. But to let all go, and to get nothing for it, this is our singular
folly: in the next Circumstance of the Price (Ye have sold your selves for
naught.)

12. A heavy charge, may some say! but is there any truth in it? or is there
indeed any sense in it? Examine that first. It is well known there can be no
buying and selling without the intervention a Price: Nulla emptio sine pretio
esse potest. Justin. 3. instit. 24.
Pactio precij is by the learned put into the definition, and therefore is
conceived to be of the essence of this kind of contract. -- (...). Anthol. 4.
cap. 12.

-- (...). Suid.


(...), is the old formula for buying and selling. So that if there be no price
paid or to be paid, nothing given or to be given in compensation or exchange
for what is received; it may be a Contract of some other species, but it can be
no Sale. It seems then to be a mere implicat, a contradiction in adjecto, to
say that a thing is sold, and yet for nothing.

13. But here we have a double help to salve it, in either of the Terms one.
First, for the term of selling: True it is, in strict buying and selling cannot
be without a price. But Divine, (especially Prophetical) expressions, are not
ever tied to such strictness. We read therefore in the Scriptures, both of
buying and selling, without a price; Of buying without a price, (come buy wine
and milk without money and without silver, Esaias 58. Esaias 58.1.
) And of selling without a price; (Thou sellest thy people for naught, and
take no money for them, Psalm 44.) and likewise here in the Text. Nay more,
Psalm 44.12.
that strictness of propriety is not always observed in other Authors. Pratei.
in lex. juris.
Vendendi verbum ad omnem alienationem pertinet, says a learned Civilian; The
word selling may be extended to every the effect whereof is an alienation. And
if so, then should we have given away our selves gratis (as it is said of some,
Ephesians. 4. that they have given themselves over to lasciviousness, (...) is the
word there: Ephesians. 4.19.
) yet might we be said to have sold our selves in this construction; that is,
to have made over our selves to Satan by an absolute alienation: whereby
whatsoever right and interest we had in our selves before (were it more or
less, were it any or none) is now conveyed unto, and settled upon him.

14. Another help we have in the other Term, for naught. For (to say truth) we
do receive a price such as it is. He is content to allow us something; he
knows we would not else bargain. profit, or pleasure, or ease, or honor, or
applause, or revenge; some small trifle or other: which being of very little
worth or use, and so not to be taken for a valuable consideration, may
therefore be called naught or nothing: not simply or absolutely nothing, but
comparatively and respectively nothing. Even as in our common speech, when a
man would express that he has under worth, the forms are ordinary: I have even
given it away; I have parted with it for a song; I have sold it for nothing.
And this common usage of the phrase, as it well preserves the sense, so does
it also (that I may stop two gaps with one Bush,) justify the truth of this
charge in my Text ( you have sold your selves for naught) for between mere
nothing, and as good as nothing, the difference is not great, in point of
discretion.

15. Here then is our folly in this sale, that on the one side we shamefully --
adeo nihil est cuique se vilius. Senec. Epist. 42.
underprised what we were to part with, and on the overvalued what we were to
receive in exchange for it. Renowned is (...). Hom. Ili. (...).
Glaucus for his folly in Homer, for changing armor with Diomedes with such
palpable disadvantage, that Proverbs came of it. And we laugh't at the
silliness of the poor Indians when the Portugals came first among them, for
parting with a massy lump of Gold-ore for a three halfpenny knife. Yet is our
folly far beyond theirs; they had something, yea and in the same kind too; he
brass, they iron for gold: that is yet one metal for another, though there be
great difference in the worth. But what sottishness possessed us, thus to
barter away Coelum pro caeno; Heaven for dung, Paradise for an apple, our
selves for

16. But flesh and blood is ready to justify it is own act, (as ever they that
are guiltiest of folly, are the shyest to own it) and thus will argue it. If we
have sold our selves to Satan; Yet the advantage seems to be on our side. We
are sure we have got something from him, say it be but small, a vanity, a toy;
yet such a toy as we are pleased withal. But he has got a verier toy from us,
a very nothing. For we have but sold our selves, and we are but men: and what
is man, but like a thing of naught Psalm. 144. Lay him in the balance with
vanity it self, Psalm. 144.4.
he will prove the verier of the two; -- 62.9.
that will overweigh him. Psalm. 62. If any man should chance to think better of
himself, and take himself to be something, there is one will tell him that he
mistaketh the matter, and deceives himself, Gal. 6.3. Esaias 40.17.
for he is nothing Gal. 6. Nay less then nothing says our Prophet Esaias 40. By
all which it should seem we have rather cheated the Devil, then he us; and have
gotten the better end of him: and are so far from having parted with something
for nothing, as we are charged; as that quite contrary we have rather gotten
something for nothing. Or at least wise, if we have but vanity for vanity; we a
thing of naught from him, he a thing of naught from us, (fumum accepit, fumum
vendidit,) as it is in the Apothegme; Or in an Epigram I have heard of two
Dunces and their disputation, (Attulit ille nihil, rettulit ille nihil:) we are
yet upon even terms, and that can deserve no great imputation of folly.

our bodies only, these mortal, corruptible, vile bodies, Romans 6.12. 1 Cor.
15.50. Phil. 3.21.
(as we find them termed by all those Epithets;) or look upon our whole
nature, as it is now embased by Sin; or even taken at the best, and set in
comparison against God; (in one of which three respects it must be understood,
where ever the scriptures speak of our worthlesnesse or nothingnesse:) there
might then be some place for these allegations. But take the whole Man
together, soul as well as body, yea chiefly that; and state him as he was
before he was sold, (as so we must do, if we will give a true judgment of the
fact,) and compare it but with other creatures, (which is but reasonable;) and
then all the allegations aforesaid The Soul is a most rich, indeed an
inestimable commmodity; Preciosa anima, says Solomon Prove. 6. the precious
Soul. So he says, Prove. 6.27.
but that speech is somewhat too general, he does not tell us how precious.
Indeed he does not; for in truth he could not: it is beyond his, or any man's
skill to give an exact praisment of it. There is somewhat bidden for it Mic. 6.

to sound loud, (thousands of Rams, and ten thousands of Rivers of Oil. Mic.

eternal wisdom of God, and by his experimental knowledge, having bought so
many and pai'd a full price for them,) our blessed Redeemer the Lord Jesus

18. And then the inference will be clear; that there never was in the world
any such folly, as sin is; any such fools as sinners are. (...), as he said:
and Solomon puts the soole upon the sinner, I am not able to say how often.
That we should thus sell and truck away these precious souls of ours, the very

exhalations and arrachements (if I may so speak) of the breath of God; not
estimable with any other thing, then with the precious blood of God: and that
not for the whole world (which had been to our incomparable disadvantage,) no
nor yet for any great Portion thereof, but for a very small pittance of it,
whereof we can have no assurance neither that we shall hold it an hour; and
which even whilst we have it, and think to enjoy it perishes in the using,
and deceives our expectations! Which of us, Col. 2.22.
laying the grievous folly for so doing; and beg pardon for it at the hands of
God, as David did after he had numbered the People, 2 Samuel 24.10.
(I have sinned greatly in that I have done, and now I beseech thee O Lord take
away mine iniquity; for I have done very foolishly.

19. And the more cause have we most humbly to beg pardon baseness and folly
herein, by how much less we are any way able to excuse either of both: it being
our own voluntary act and deed. For so is the next Particular, ( Ye have sold
your selves.) Naturally what is blameworthy; we had rather put off upon any
body else, light where it will, then take it home to our selves. V. Cic. 1. ad
Herenn; Quintil 7.4 etc.
Translatio criminis the shifting of a fault, is by Rhetoricians made a branch
of their Art. We need not go to their schools to learn it: Nature and our
mother-wit will prompt us sufficiently thereunto: we brought it from the womb,
sucked it from the breasts of our mother Eve. Genesis 3.
This base and foolish act whereof we now speak, how payments, and taxes) we
plead hard to have bearers and partners, that may go a share with us, and ease
us (if not a toto, yet) at leastwise a tanto, and in some part. Ose 13.9.
But it will not be. Still Perditio tua ex te: it will fall all upon us at the
last, when we have done what we can.

20. We have but one of these three ways to put off; a fourth I cannot
imagine; By making it either Gods act, who is the original owner; or Adams act,
who was our Progenitor, or Satan's who is the Purchaser. If any of these will
hold, we are well enough; Let us try them all. It should seem the first will:
for is there not Text for it. How should one of them chase a thousand (says
Moses) except their rock had sold them, Deuteronomy. 32.30.
Deuteronomy. 32. and God was their rock. So David, Psalm 44. Thou have sold thy
people for naught: and sundry times in the book of Judges we read how God sold
Israel sometimes into the hands of one enemy, Psalm. 44.12. Judge. 2.14, etc.
and sometimes of another. Very right. But none of all this is spoken of the
sale now in Question: it is meant of another manner of Sale, which is
consequent to this and presupposes it. God indeed sells us over to
punishment, the sale meant in those places) but not till we have first sold our
selves over to sin, which is the sale in this place. We first most unjustly
sell away our souls, and then he most justly sells away our bodies, and our
liberty, and our peace, and our credit, and the rest.

21. Let us beware then whatsoever we do that we do not charge God wrongfully,
by making him in the least degree the author of our sins, or but so much as a
party, or an accessory to our follies; either directly, or indirectly. Himself
disclaimeth it utterly, and casts it all upon us. Esaias 50.1. Which of my
creditors is it to whom if it were my deed, deal punctually, tell me when, and
where, and to whom: But if it were not, why do you lay it to my charge? Behold,
for your iniquities have you sold your selves. It was merely your own doing:
and if you suffer for it; blame your selves, and not me.

Hac non successit: We must try another way, and see if we can leave it upon
Adam. For did not he sell us many a fair year before we were in rerum natura?
And if the Father sell away the inheritance from his unborn child, how can he
do withal? and if he cannot help it, why should he be blamed for it? Must our
teeth be set on edge with the grapes our grandfather ate, and not we? It must
be confessed, the first Sale was his personal act, by which he passed away both
himself and all his posterity; and so were we venditi antequam editi, sold a
long while before we were born. And that Sale is still of force against us, (I
mean that of Original sin, till it be annulled by baptism) in as much as being
virtually in his loins, contract, we are presumed to have given our virtual
consent thereunto. But there is another part of the sale which lies most
against us, whereto our own actual consent has passed in confirmation, and for
the further ratification, of our forefathers act: when for satisfaction of
some ungodly lust or other, we condescended by committing sin in our own
persons, to strengthen Satan's title to us, whatever it was, as much as lay in
us. Like the unthrifty heir of some unthrifty father, who when he comes at
age, for a little spending money in hand, is ready to do any further act his
fathers act, who had long before sold away the lands from him. Whatever then we
may impute of the former, I mean of original guilt to Adam: yet we must take
the later, I mean our actual transgressions, wholly and solely to our own
selves.

23. Nor can we thirdly, lay the blame upon Satan, or his instruments; which is
our last and commonest refuge. Serpens decepit was Eves plea; and she pleaded
but truth: Genesis 3.13.
for the Serpent had indeed beguiled her; St Paul has said it after her twice
over. Esau after he had sold his birthright his own self, 2 Cor. 11.3. 1 Timothy
2.14.
yet accused his brother for supplanting him. Aaron for making the calf, and
Saul for Exodus 32.22. 1 Samuel 15.21.
yet both lay it upon the people. Others have done the like, and still do, and
will do to the worlds end. But alas! these fig leaves are too thin to hide our
nakedness: all these excuses are insufficient to discharge us from being the
authors of our own destruction. Say Satan be a cunning cheater, (as he is no
less!) who should have looked to that? had not God endowed us with
understanding to discern his most subtle snares, and with liberty of will to
decline them? Say he do tempt us perpetually; and by most sly insinuations
seek to steal away our hearts; That is the utmost he can do: a tempter he is:
and that a shrewd one; Matthew. 4.1.
(...) (he has his own from it;) yet he is but a tempter, he cannot enforce us
to any thing, without our consent: and God has given us power, and God has
given us charge too, not to consent. Say ungodly men (who are his agents) cease
not by plausible persuasions, importunities, and all the engagements they can
pretend, to solicit and not to consent, Qui suo sine alte^o impulsu cadere
potest, al^eno absque suo cadere non potest. Bern. sermon. 85.
they cannot hurt us. My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not, Prove.
1.10. Say they lay many a cursed example before us, as Jacob did pilled rods in
the sheep-troughs; or cast stones of offense in our way! Have we not a rule to
walk by, by which we ought to guide our selves, Genesis 30.37. -- 8.
and not by the examples of men? And whereto serve our eyes in our heads, but
to look to our feet, that we may so order our steps, as not to dash our foot
against a stone?

24. Certainly no man can take harm but from himself. Let no man, then when he
is tempted and yields, say he is tempted of God: Jam. 1.13.
says S. James; that is, does not so much as endeavor to do it. Nay I may
add further, Let no man when he is tempted, say he is tempted of Satan. That
is, let him not think to excuse himself by that: For even Satan Infirmus hostis
est, qui non potest vincere (...) volentem. Epist. Incerti ad Demetriad. cap.
25. -- 14.
tempts no man in that sense and cum effectu. Though he endeavor it all he
can; yet, it cannot take effect, unless we will. S. James therefore concludes
positively, that every man's temptation, if it take effect, is merely from his
own lust. It is then our own act and deed, that we are Satan's Vassals;
Disclaim it we cannot: and what so ever misery or mischief ensues thereupon,
we ought not to impute our selves alone. He could never have laid any claim to
us, if we had not consented to the bargain, and yielded to sell our selves.

25. Of the Sale hitherto, I come now to the Redemption, the more Evangelical,
and comfortable part of the Text. And as in the Sale we have seen man's
inexcusable baseness and folly in the several circumstances: so we may now
behold Gods admirable power and grace in this Redemption. His Power, that he
does it so effectually, The thing shall be done, ( Ye shall be Redeemed.) His
Grace, that he does it so freely, without any money of ours. (Ye shall be
Redeemed

26. First the work to be effectually done. It is here spoken in the future (
Ye shall be Redeemed;) not only, nor perhaps so much, because it was a
prophecy of a thing then to come, which now since Christ's coming in the flesh
is actually accomplished: but also, and especially, to give us to understand
that when God is pleased to Redeem us, all the powers on earth, and in hell,
cannot, shall not hinder it. By the Levitical Law, if a man had sold himself
for a bondslave, his brother, or some other near friend might redeem him:
Levit. 25.26.
or if ever God should make him able, he might redeem himself. to Redeem his
own soul, or to make agreement for his brothers. It would cost more to redeem
their souls, Psalm. 49.8.
then any man had to lay down: so that of necessity he must let that alone for
ever. But when the son of God himself sets in, and is content to be made of
God to us Redemption: the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand, 1
Cor. 1.30. Esaias 53.10.
and the work shall go on wondrous happily and successfully.

27. His Power, his Love, and his Right, do all assure thereof. First his
Power. Our Redeemer is strong and mighty, Jer. 50.34.
even the Lord of hosts. And he had need be so: for he that has us in
possession is strong and mighty; Ter fortis amatus in the Parable Luke 11th.
Luke 11.21. -- 22.
He buckleth his armor about him, and stands upon his guard with a
resolution to maintain what he has purchased, and to hold possession if he
can. But then when a stronger then he comes upon Genesis 3.15.
and having bruised his head takes away from him his armor wherein he trusted
(the Law, Sin, Death, and Hell:) there is no remedy but he must yield per-force
what he cannot hold, and suffer his house to be ransacked, and his goods and
possessions to be carried away. Greater is he that is in you (says S. John)
that is Christ, 1 John 4.6.
then he that is in the world, that is the Devil. Christ came into the world on
purpose to destroy the works of the Devil: 1 John 3.8.
and he did atchieve what he came for; he has destroyed them. And amongst his
other works he has destroyed this Purchase also; wrung the out of his hand,
even the handwriting that was against us; Col. 2.14.
and having blotted, defaced, and cancelled it, took it out of the way, nayling
it to his Cross.

28. Such was his Power: his Love secondly not less; which made him as willing
as he was able, to undertake this work of our redemption. In his love and in
his pity he redeemed them. Esaias 63.9. There is such a height, and depth, and
length, Ephesians. 3.18.
and breadth in that Love; such a (...) in every dimension of it, as none but an
infinite understanding can fathom. Sic Deus dilexit: Joh. 3.16.
So God loved the world; But how much that so contains, no tongue or wit Word
should be made Flesh; that the holy one of God should be made sin; Joh. 1.14. 2
Cor. 5.21. Gal. 3.13.
that God blessed for ever should be made a curse; that the Lord of life and
glory should suffer an inglorious death, and pour out his own most precious
blood, to ransom such worthless, thankless, graceless Traitors, as we were,
that had so desperately made our selves away; and that into the hands of his
deadliest enemy, and that upon such poor and unworthy conditions! O altitudo!
Love incomprehensible: It swalloweth up the sense and understanding of Men and
Angels;

29. I leave it therefore, and go on to the next, his Right. When de facto we
sold our selves to Satan, we had de jure, no power, or right at all so to do,
being we were not our own: and so in truth the title is naught, and the Sale
void: Yet it is Diaboli in hominem jus, etsi non just de quisitum, just tamen
permissum. Bern. Epist. 190.
good against however: we may not plead the invalidity of it: for so much as in
reason no man ought to make advantage of his own act. Our act then barreth us:
But yet it cannot bar the right owner from challenging his own wheresoever he
finds it. And therefore we may be well assured God will not suffer the Devil,
who is but malae fidei possessor, an intruder and a cheater, quietly to enjoy
what is Gods and not his: but he will eject him (we have that word, John 12.21.
Ejicietur, now is the Prince of this world cast out) and recover out of his
possession that which he has no right at all to hold.

30. Sundry inferences we might raise hence, if we had time, three duties which
we owe to God for this Redemption; because they answer so fitly, to these three
last mentioned assurances. We owe him Affiance, in respect of his Power; in
requital of his Love, thankfulness; and in regard of his Right, Service. First,
the consideration of his Power in our Redemption, may put a great deal of
comfort and confidence into us: that, having now redeemed us, if we do but
cleave fast to him, and revolt not again, he will protect us from Sin and
Satan, and all other enemies and pretenders whatsoever. O Israel fear not, for
I have redeemed thee, Esaias 43. If then the Devil shall seek by any of his wiles
or suggestions at any time to get us over to him again, Esaias 43.1.
solicitor, and will not lose his claim by discontinuance: Luke 1.69.
) Let us then look to that Cornu salutis, that horn of salvation, that God has
raised up for us in Christ our Redeemer; and fly thither for succor as to the
horns of the Altar, (saying with David Psalm 119. I am thine, oh save me:) and
we shall be safe. In all inward temptations, Psalm. 119.94.
in all outward distresses, at the hour of death, and in the day of judgment,
we may with great security commit the keeping of our souls to him, both as a
faithful creator, and as a powerful Redeemer: saying once more with David,
(Into thy hands I commend my spirit, for thou have redeemed me, O Lord thou God
of truth,

31. Secondly, the consideration of his love in our Redemption, should quicken
us to a thankful acknowledgment of his great and undeserved goodness toward
us. Let them give thanks whom the Lord has redeemed, Psalm. 107.7.
and delivered from the hand of the enemy, Psalm. 107. Let all men, let all
creatures do it: but let them especially. If the blessings of corn and wine and
oil, of health and peace and plenty, of deliverance from sicknesses,
pestilences, famines, and other calamities; can so affect us, as to provoke at
least some overly and superficial forms of thanksgiving from us: how carnal are
our earthy, if the contemplation of the depth of -- just homo addictus, sed
misericorditer liberatus, Bernard. Epist. 190.
the riches of Gods mercy, poured out upon us in this great work of our
Redemption, do not even ravish our hearts with an ardent desire to pour them
out unto him again in hymns and Psalms and songs thanksgiving with a Benedictus
in our mouths, ( Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for he has visited and
redeemed his people. Luke 1.68.
)

32. Thirdly, the consideration of his Right should bind us to do him service.
We were his before, for he made us; Psalm. 100.3.
and we ought him service for that. But now we are his more then before, and by
a new title; for he has bought us and paid for us: and we owe him more service
for that. The Apostle therefote urges it as a matter of great equity: you are
not your own but his; 1 Cor. 6.19, ^0
therefore you are not to satisfy your selves by doing your own lusts, but to
glorify him by doing his will. When Christ redeemed us by his blood, his
purpose redeem us unto God, (Rev. 5.9.) and not to our selves: and to redeem us
from our vain conversation (1 Pet. 1.18.) and not to it. And he therefore
delivered us out of the hands of our enemies, that we might the more freely and
securely and without fear serve him in holiness and righteousness all the days
of our lives, Luke 1.74.
Luke 1. which being both our bounden duty, and the thing withal so very
reasonable; we have the more to answer for, if we do not make a conscience of
it to perform it accordingly. He has done his part, (and that which he was no
way bound unto) in redeeming us; and he has done it to purpose, done it
effectually: Let it be our care to do our part (for in serving him; and let us
also do it to purpose, do it really, and thoroughly and constantly.

33. Thus is our Redemption done effectually: it is also done freely; which is
the only point now remaining. Not for price, nor reward, Esaias 45.13. but freely
and without money here in the Text. Nor need we here fear another
contradiction. For the meaning is not, that there was no price paid at all; but
that there was none paid by us: we laid out nothing toward this great purchase,
there went none of our money to it. But otherwise, that there was a price paid,
the Scriptures are clear: You are bought with a price says St Paul, 1 Cor 6.
and he says it over again, Chap 7. 1 Cor. 6.20.
He that paid it calls it (...), a ransom, -- 7.23. Mat. 20.28. 1 Timothy 2.6.
that is as much as to say a price of redemption: and his Apostle somewhat
more; (...), which implies a just and satisfactory price, full as much as the
thing can be worth. Yet not paid to Satan, in whose possession we were; for we
have found already, that he was but an Usurper, and his title naught. He had
but bought of us; and we by our sale could convey unto him no more right then
we had our selves: which was just none at all. Our Redeemer therefore would not
enter into any capitulation with him, or offer to him any Terms of
composition: his own right to use his power. And so he vindicated us from him
by main strength: With his own right hand and with his holy arm he got himself
the victory, Psalm. 98.2.
and us liberty, without any price or ransom paid him.

34. But then unto Almighty God his father, and our Lord heavy Curse we lay,
and whose just vengeance would not be appeased toward us for our grievous
presumption without a condign satisfaction to him, I say there was a price paid
by our Redeemer, and that the greatest that ever was paid for any purchase
since the world began. 1 Pet. 18.
Not silver and gold, says S. Peter, which being corruptible things are not
valuable against our immortal and incorruptible souls; Col. 2.3.
But even himself, in whom are absconditi thesauri, amassed and hidden all the
treasures of the wisdom of God, and even the whole riches of his grace;
treasure enough to redeem a whole world of sinners. Take it collectively, or
distributively; singula or genera singulorum; this way or that way, or which
way you will* in Christ there is copiosa redemptio, redemption plenty and
enough for all if they will but accept it. Psalm. 130.7.
Take all mankind singly one by one; Gal. 2.20. 1 Timothy 2.6.
He gave himself for me, says S. Paul in one place. Take them altogether in
the lump; He gave himself a ransom for all; in another.

35. Now for a man to give himself, what is it else, but to give his soul,
(for that is himself, as we heard before,) and his life, for vita in anima, the
life is in the soul: and these he gave. He gave up his soul (when thou shall
make his soul an offering for sin^ Esaias 53.10.) and he laid down his life (the
son of man came to Mat. 10. Mat. 10.28.
) More then this in love he could not give; for what greater love, then to lay
down ones life. And less then this in justice he might not give: Joh. 15, 13.
for Death by the Law being the wages of sin, Romans 6.23.
there could be no Redemption from death so as to satisfy the Law, without the
death of the Redeemer.

36. Yea, and it must be a bloody death too: for anima in sanguine, Heb. 9.22.
the life is in the blood, and without shedding of blood there can be no
remission, no redemption. All those bloody sacrifices of bulls and goats and
lambs in the old Testament; all those frequent sprinklings of blood, upon the
door posts, upon the book, upon the people, the tabernacle, and upon all the
vessels of ministry; and all those legal purifications in which blood was used,
(as almost all things are by the Law purged with blood. Heb. 9.22. -- 12.24.
Heb. 9.) they were all but so many types and shaddows, prefiguring this blood
of sprinkling; which speaks so many good things for us, pacifieth the fierce
anger of God toward us, purges us from all sins, and redeemeth us from hell
and damnation. Col. 1.20.
I mean the meritorious blood of the Cross, the most precious blood of Christ,
as of a lamb without blemish. 1 Pet. 1.18.

37. But can there be worth enough, may some say in the blood of one single
Lamb, to be a valuable compensation for the sins of the whole world? First,
this was agnus singularis, a lamb of special note; not such another in the
whole flock. All we like sheep have gone astray: Esaias. 53.6.
but so did this lamb never. All of us like the increase of Laban's flock,
speckled or ring-streaked, but Momus himself were set to search, 1 Pet. 1.19.
he could not yet find the least spot or blemish. A cunninger searcher then he
has pried narrowly into every corner of his life; who if there had been any
thing amiss, would have been sure to have spied it and proclaimed it, but could
find nothing. Ioh. 14.30.
The Prince of this world comes and has nothing in me. That is something; his
Innocence. But if that be not enough, (for the Angels also are innocent,)
behold then more. He is secondly, Agnus Dei, the Lamb of God; that is, Ioh.
1.29.
the Lamb which God had appointed and set apart is no other name given under
heaven, Act. 4.12. Ioh. 6.27.
no nor in heaven neither, nor above, by which we can be redeemed. Him, and him
alone, has God the Father sealed: and by virtue of that seal authorized and
enabled to undertake this great work. Or if you have not yet enough, (for it
may be said, what if it had been the pleasure of God to have sealed one of the
Angels?) Behold then thirdly that which is beyond all exception, and leaves no
place for cavil or scruple: He is Agnus Deus. This lamb is God, the son of God,
very God of very God: and so the blood of this Lamb is the very blood of God.
Act. 20. And it is this dignity of his nature his innocence only, Act. 20.28.
no nor yet his deputation too, without this,) that sets such a huge value
upon his blood, that it is an infinite price, of infinite merit, able to
satisfy an infinite justice, and to appease an infinite wrath.

38. You will now confess I doubt not, that this Redemption was not gratis,
came not for nothing, in respect of him: it cost him full dear, even his
dearest lives-blood. But then in respect of us, it was a most free and gracious
redemption. It was no charge at all to us; we disburs'd not a mite, not a doyt
toward it: Which is the very true reason why it is said in the Text, Ye shall
be redeemed This work then is merely an act of grace, not a fruit of merit:
grace, abundant grace on his part; no merit, not the least merit at all on
ours. And well it is for us, that we have to do with so gracious a God. Go to
an officer, and who can promise to himself any ordinary favor from him without
a fee? Go into the shops, and what can ye take up without either money, or
credit, or security for it? Si nihil attuleris* bring nothing, and have
nothing. Only when we have to do with God, Poverty is no impediment, but rather
an advantage to us. (...). This Gospel belongs to none but the poor only. The
tidings of a Mat. 11.5.
most blessed and welcome news to those that are sensible of their own poverty,
and take it as of Grace. But who so thinks his own penny good silver, and
will be putting in and bidding for it; will stand upon his terms as David did
with Araunah, 2 Samuel 24.24.
and will pay for it, or he will not have it. Let that man beware lest his money
and he perish together, and lest he get neither part nor fellowship in Acts
8.20, 21.


39. Yet this I must tell you withal, there is something to be done on our
part, for the applying of this gracious redemption wrought by Christ to our own
souls for their present comfort and future salvation. Tit. 2.12.
We must repent from dead works, believe the Gospel, and endeavor to live
godly, righteously, and soberly in this present world. The grace of God is
proclaimed, and (as it were) exposed to sale in the preaching of the Gospel:
there is an offer made us of it there, and we are earnestly invited to buy it,
( Ho every one that thirsts, come to the waters and buy. Esaias 55.1.
) But he that comes to buy, must bring manuprecium with him, or he were as
good keep away. He that comes to this market without a price in his hand (and
the price is faith, Prove. 17.16.
repentance, and godliness) it is a sign he has no heart, and he is no better
then a fool, says Solomon, Prove. 17. But still we must remember, that this is
but conditio non causa: a condition which he requires to be performed on our
part, not any just cause of the performance on his part. And he requires it
rather as a testimony of our willingness to embrace so fair an offer, then as a
valuable consideration in any proportion at all to the worth of the thing
offered. What we bring, if it be tendered kindly and as it ought, in sincerity
and humility, he kindly accepts of it. But if we bring it either in Pride; or
would have it taken for better then we know it is, which is our hypocrisy:
Luke 1.53.
we quite mar our own market, and shall be sent away empty.

40. The sum of all is this, and I have done. Let us take the whole shame of
our inexcusable baseness and folly in this Sale to our selves;; and let us give
to God the whole glory of his admirable power and grace in our Redemption. Non
tibi, Domine, non tibi; not unto thee O Lord, not unto thee, but unto us be all
the shame, that had thus wretchedly sold our selves for naught: Non nobis,
Domine, non nobis; not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy the glory,
that thou have thus graciously redeemed us without money. Amen. So be it.


THEOBALDS, JULY 1638.
Romans 15.5. Now the God of Patience and Consolation grant you to be like minded
one toward another, according to Christ Jesus.


1. SAint Paul had much labored in the whole former Chapter, and in the
beginning of this, to make up that breach, which (by the mutual judgings of the
Weak, and despisings of the Strong) had been long kept open in the then Church
of Christ at Rome: and was likely, if not timely prevented, to grow wider and
wider, to the great dishonor of God, dis-service of his Church, and discomfort
of every good man. He had plied them with variety of Arguments and Persuasions;
spent a great deal of holy Logic and Rhetoric upon them: and now to set all
that home, and to drive the nail (as it were) to the head, that so he might at
length manum de tabula, he concludes his discourse about that argument, votive
Prayer or Benediction, [ Now the God of Patience and Consolation grant you to
be like minded one toward another according to Christ Jesus: That ye may with
one mind, and with one mouth glorify God even the Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ.

2. Wherein we may observe first, the formality of the Prayer, in those first
words [ Now the God of Patience and Consolation grant you:] And then the matter
or substance of it, in the rest. Wherein we have expressed, with their several
amplifications; first the Thing desired, ( their Unity,) in the remainder of
the fifth verse: secondly, the End, for which it is desired, [ Gods glory] in
the the fifth verse only, and therein, beginning with the formality of the
Prayer, observe first, the connection of this period with the precedent
discourse, in the particle (...), Now, or But, [(...), Now the God etc.
Secondly, the Party, whose help is implored, and from whom the blessing must
come; even God [(...), God grant.) Thirdly, the special Attributes, whereby
that party is here described: [(...), etc. The God of Patience and Consolation.

3. Of the Connection first. (...), Now God grant. In planted unity among you by
my Doctrine, and watered it with my Exhortations: using the best reasons and
persuasions I could devise for that end. What now remains, but that I second
my labors with my prayers? and commend what I have planted and watered, to his
blessing, who alone is able to give the increase? I have shown you what you
are to do: (...), Now the God of Patience and Consolation grant it may be done.

4. The Apostle saw it needful he should pray for the people of God, as well as
instruct them: and therefore he seals up the Exhortation with a word of
Benedection. He had spoken, written, expostulated, disputed, reproved,
besought, and what ever else was to be done in the way of Teaching: but he knew
there was yet something more to be done, to make the work complete; lest else he
should have run in vain, either labored in vain. That therefore he might not
give out in extremo actu; nor having brought his building to some perfection,
then to let it stand at a stay, and so decay and drop down, for want of laying
on the roof: he turns himself from them to God; is instant with him another
while, as hitherto them; in hope that some good effect might follow. A course
not unusual with him ( velut emblemate vermicula^o) to emblemish his Epistles
upon fit occasions with supplications, Lucius apud Cic. 3. de orat.
prayers, intercessions, and givings of thanks: breaking off the course of his
speech, and that now and then somewhat abruptly (witness Cor 9.10. and some
other places,) to lace in a Prayer, a Blessing, a Thanksgiving.

5. Preachers by his example, to Pray for the people, as well as to instruct
them: So should their labors bring more comfort to themselves, more profit to
their hearers. Mat. 11.12.
The kingdom of Heaven must suffer violence, and our people will not ordinarily
be brought unto it without some force: But let me tell you, it is not so much
the violence of the Pulpit, that does the deed, (it were many times better, if
there appeared less violence there) as the violence of the Closet. Nor they
only; but all Governors and Superiors in every other kind: indeed generally
all Christians whatsoever, (in Example. Think none of you, you have
sufficiently discharged your parts toward those that are under your charge; if
you have instructed them in what they are to do, admonished them to do
thereafter, reproved, or corrected them when they have done amiss, encouraged
or rewarded them when they have done well: so long as your faithful and fervent
prayers for them have been wanting. In vain shall you wrestle with their
stubbornness and other corruptions, though you put to all your strength, and
wrestle with great wrestlings (as Rachel said upon the birth of Nepthali, Genesis
30.8.
) so long as you do but wrestle with them only: wrestle but with flesh and
blood; and alas, what great matters can thereof be done? Then, or not at all,
shall you wrestle to purpose, Heb. 12.9.
when you enter the lists with the father of spirits himself, as Jacob did:
wrestling with him by your importunate prayers, and not giving him over, till
you have wrung a blessing from him, either for your selves, or them, or both.
For when you have done what you can, the blessing must come from him, or it
will never come. (...). Which is the next Point.

6. God grant.] As for himself, the Apostle well knew, by all those convincing
Reasons, and winning Insinuations he had used, the outward sense, and by the
sense represent fit motives to their understandings: it was God only, that
could bow and frame the heart to Peace and Unity. You may wish yeace, and do
your good wills to persuade unto peace; and you ought to do it: but unless God
set in with you, it will not take effect. Non persuadebis, etiamsi persuaseris.
Genesis 9.27.
God shall persuade Iaphet to dwell in the tents of Sem. Genesis 9. Noah's
persuasions will not do it, nor Sems; though they should speak with the tongues
of men and Angels: but let God persuade Iaphet, and Iaphet will be persuaded.
He is not only a lover of Concord, (for such, by his grace, the author of peace
likewise. A thing so proper, Romans 15.33, 1. These. 5.23, 2. These. 2.16.
and peculiar to him alone, that he sundry times takes his style and
denomination from it: The God of Peace. The very God of Peace, etc.

7. For alas! without him, what can be expected from us? whose dispositions, by
reason of that pride that abounds in us, are naturally turbulent and
self-willed. The heart of man is a sour Almighty power. What man is able to
take down his own pride sufficiently? (many a good man has more ado with this
one viper, then with all his other corruptions besides.) But how much less then
is any man able to beat down and subdue the pride of another man's spirit? Only
God with the strength of his arm is able to throw down every exalting thought;
and to lay the highest mountains level with the lower flats. He can infuse a
spirit into us, to eat out by degrees that cankered proud flesh, that breeds
us all those vexations. Non sicut alii, Luke 18.11.
He can make us so vile in our our selves then of all other men, we shall
through lowliness of mind esteem every other man better then our selves. Phil.
2.3.


8. But in the mean time never marvail to see so many scandals and divisions
every where in the world; (distractions and wranglings in the Church, factions
and convulsions in Commonwealths, sidings and censuring in your Towns,
jarrings and partakings, even in your private families:) so long as there is
pride and self-love in every man's own bosom, Jam. 4.1.
or indeed any other lust unsubdued. For all these wars and fightings without,
what other are they then the scum of the pot that boyls within? the ebullitions
of those lusts that war and the dictates of corrupt nature? Saint Paul says,
There must be heresies: 1 Cor. 11.19.
even as we use to say, That that will be must be. His meaning is, there will
be heresies: there is no help for it; the wit of man cannot hinder it. Nay it
were well, if the wit of man did not sometimes further it, Ingeniosi malo
publico, is none of the best commendations: yet such as it is, there are too
many, that deserve it but too well: That employ their wit, learning, eloquence,
power, and parts, (by the right use whereof they might do God and his Church
excellent service) to raise strifes, foment quarrels, and blow the coal of
contention to make it blaze afresh, when it lay in the the son of man will
cause to be gathered out of his kingdom (...), all things that minister
occasion of stumbling or contention. Matthew. 13.41.
But in the mean time Sinite crescere must have place. We must be content to
want that peace, -- 30.
which we desire, but cannot have without God; till he be pleased to grant it:
and possess our selves in patience, Luke 21.19.
if still something or other be amiss, whereof we can see as yet no great
likelihood that it will be better.

9. By which Patience yet I mean nothing less, then either in a stoical (...),
a dull phlegmatic stupidity, that is not sensible of the want of so great a
blessing; or much less in public persons or governors a retchless slothful
connivence, whereby to suffer men to run wild into all kind of irregularitie
without restraint. Christian Patience, as neither murmureth at the want, nor
despaireth of a supply; but out of the sense of want, is diligent to seek
supply. Praying with the Church, Da domine, Give peace in our time O Lord: Romans
12.18.
and endeavoring ((...)) so far as is possible, and to the uttermost of our
power, to have peace with, and to make peace among, all men. For Almighty God
uses not to cast away his choicest blessings upon those men, that think them
not well worthy their best both Prayers and Pains. He alone can frame men's
hearts to unity and peace: but we are vain and unreasonable, if we expect he
should do silent without seeking to him for it by our Prayers; or sluggish,
without employing our best endeavors about it to our powers.

10. But why is this God, to whom we are thus to make our addresses, that he
would be pleased to grant us this like-mindedness, and to give unto us and to
all his people the blessing of peace, here styled the God of Patience and
Consolation? The enquiries are many. Why first, the God of Patience? And
secondly, why the God of Consolation? taking the two Attributes apart, either
by it self. Then taking them both together: First for the choice; why these two
rather then any other? Secondly for the conjunction; why these two the order;
why Patience first, and before Consolation. Five in all: somewhat of each.

11. The former Title is, The God of Patience. Which may be understood, either
Formaliter, or Causaliter: either subjectively or effectively, as they use to
distinguish. Or if these School-termes be too obscure; then in plain terms
thus: either of Gods patience, or Ours. That is to say; either of that patience
which God uses toward us, or of that patience which God by his grace and holy
Spirit works in us. Of Gods patience and long-suffering to usward,
Scripture, we have daily and plentiful experience. How slowly he proceeds to
vengeance, being so unworthily provoked: how he bears with our infirmities,
(Infirmities? ey and Negligences too; yea and yet higher our very Presumptions
and Rebellions:) how he spreads out his hand all the day long, waiting day
after day, year after year, Esaias 65.2.
for our conversion and amendment, that he may have mercy upon us. And even
thus understood ( Subjective) the Text would bear a fair construction, as not
altogether impertinent to the Apostles scope. It might at least intimate to us
this, that finding so much patience from him, it would well become us also to
show some patience to our brethren. effective: of that Patience, which is
indeed from God, as the Cause; but yet in us, as the subject. Even as a little
after ( verse 13.) he is called the God of Hope: because it is he that makes
us to abound in hope, as the reason is there expressed. And as here in the Text
he is styled the God of consolation; for no other reason, but that it is he
that puts comfort and cheerfulness into our hearts.

12. It gives us clearly to see what we are of our selves and without God:
nothing but heat and impatience; ready to vex our selves, and to fly in the
faces of our brethren for every trifle. You have need of patience, Heb. 10.36.
says the Apostle Heb. 10. We have indeed: God help us. 1. We live here in a
vale of misery, where we meet with a thousand petty crosses and vexations
(quotidianarum molestiarum minutiae) in the common road of our lives; poor
things in themselves, and if rationally considered very trifles and vanity, yet
able to bring vexation upon our impatient spirits: we had patience to digest
them. 2. We are beset, surrounded with a world of temptations, assaulting us
within and without, and on every side, and at every turn: we had need of
Patience to withstand them. 3. We are exposed to manifold injuries, obloquies,
and sufferings, many times without cause; it may be sometimes for a good cause:
we had need of patience to bear them. 4. We have many rich and precious
promises made us in the word; of grace, of glory, of outward things; of some of
which we find as yet but slender performance, and of other some (but that we
are sure the anchor of our hope is so well fixed, that it cannot fail) no
visible probability of their future performance: we had need of patience expect
them. 5. We have many good duties required to be done of us in our Christian
callings, and in our particular vocations; for the honor of God, and the
service of our brethren: we had need of patience to go through with them. 6. We
have to converse with men of different spirits and tempers: some hott, fiery,
and furious; others flat, sullen, and sluggish; some unruly, some ignorant,
some proud and scornful, some peevish and obstinate, some toyish fickle and
humorous; all subject to passions and infirmities in one kind or other: we had
need of patience to frame our conversations to the weaknesses of our brethren,
and to tolerate what we cannot remedy: bear each others burdens, we may so
fulfill the Law of Christ. Gal. 6.2.


13. Great need we have of Patience you see: and my Text lets us see, where
we have to serve our need. God is the God of patience: in him, and from him it
is to be had, but not elsewhere. When ever then we find our selves ready to
fret at any cross occurrent, to venge every injury, to rage at every light
provocation, to droope at the delay of any promise, to slugge in our own
performances, to skew at the infirmities of others: take we notice first of the
impatience of our own spirits, and condemn it; then hie patience and meekness,
and he that is the God of patience will not deny it us. That is the former
Title, The God of Patience.

The God of Consolation. And the reason is, (for this can be understood no
otherwise then effective) because sound comfort is from God alone. I, even I,
am he that comfort you, Esaias 51.12. Psalm. 23.4. Esaias 51.3. Zach. 1.17. etc.
Joh. 14.16, 15.26. etc.
says he himself Esaias 51. Thy rod, and thy staff they comfort me, says David
Psalm. 23. And the Prophets often, The Lord shall comfort Sion. The Holy Ghost
is therefore called as by his proper name, (...), The Comforter. Ey perhaps, as
one among many others; or (allowing the Greek article his Emphasis) as the
chiefest of all the rest: which hinders not but there may be other Comforters
besides, though happily of less excellency. If there were no more in it but so,
and the whole allegation should be granted: his comforts, as the best. But in
truth the Scriptures so speak of God, not as the chiefest, but as the only
Comforter: admitting no partnership in this prerogative. Blessed be God etc.
The Father of mercies, 2 Cor. 1.3.
and the God of all Consolation.

15. May we not then seek for comfort, may some say: nay, do we not sometimes
find comfort in friends, riches, reputation, and such other regular pleasures
and delights, as the creatures afford? under God we may always, and do
sometimes, reap comfort from the creatures: But those comforts issue still from
him, as from the first and only sufficient cause. Who is pleased to make use of
his Creatures as his instruments, either for comfort, correction, or
destruction, as seems good in his own eyes. When they do supply us with any
comfort, it is but as the conduit-pipes, which serve the offices in a great
house with water; which yet springs not from them, but is only by them
conveyed thither from the fountain or springhead. Set them once against God,
or do but take them without God: you may as soon squeeze water out flint stone,
or suck nourishment out of a dry breast, as gain a drop of comfort from any of
the Creatures. Those supposed comforts, that men seek for, or think they have
sometimes found in the Creatures, are but titular and imaginary, not
substantial and real comforts. And such, how ever we esteem of them onward,
they will appear to be at the last: for they will certainly fail us in the evil
day, when our souls shall stand most of all in need of comfort. The
Consolations of God are first Pure; they run clear, without mud or mixture:
secondly Full, satiating the appetites of the soul and leaving no vacuities:
thirdly permanent, such as (unless by our hinder or deprive us of. In every of
which three respects, all worldly comforts, as they come but from the
Creatures, fall infinitely short: as might easily be shown, had we but time to
compare them.

16. It is hard to say the whiles, whether is greater, our Misery, or Madness:
who forsake the Lord, the clear fountain of living waters, Jer. 2.13.
to dig to our selves broken pits, that hold no water in the puddle, and but a
very little of that neither, and yet cannot hold that long neither. What
fondness is in us, to lay out our money for that which is not bread, and our
labor for that which satisfies not? Esaias 55.2.
to wear out our bodies with travel, and torture our souls with cares, in the
pursuit of these muddy, narrow, and fleeting comforts? when we may have Nectar
and Ambrosia, the delicacies of the bread of life; and of the water of life
gratis and without price. Only if we will but open our mouths to crave it, -- 1.
and open our hands to receive it, from him, who is so well stored of it, and
is withal so willing to impart it with all freedom and bounty; even the Father

17. Thus far of the two Titles severally: let us now put them together, and
see what we can make out of them. The God of patience and Consolation. Where
every man's first demand will be, why the Apostle should choose to enstile
Almighty God from these two, of Patience and of Consolation, rather then from
some other of those Attributes, which occur (perhaps) more frequently in holy
writ: as God of Wisdom, of Power, of Mercy, of Peace, of Hope, etc. What ever
other inducements the Apostle might have for so doing; two are apparent: and
let them satisfy us. The one; the That we through patience and comfort of the
Scriptures might have hope.] Having once named them both together there: it was
neither incongruous nor inelegant, to repeat them again both together here. 2.
The other; the fitness of these Titles, and their sutableness unto the matter
of the Prayer. For the most part you shall find in those forms of prayer that
are left us registered in the book of God, such Titles and Attributes given to
God in the prefaces of those prayers, as do best sort with the principal matter
contained therein: Which course the Church also has observed in her Liturgies.
The Apostle Unity, might well make mention of Patience and Consolation: of
Patience, as a special help thereunto; and of Consolation, as a special fruit
and effect thereof. As if he had said, If you could have patience, you would
soon grow to be of one mind: and if you were once come to that, you should
find a great deal of comfort in it (...), The God therefore of Patience and
Consolation grant it may be so with you.

18. First, Patience is a special help to Unity. For what is it but the pride
and heat of men's spirits, that both sets contentions a foot at the first,
and afterward keeps them afoot. Only by Prove. 13.10.
says Solomon, Prove. 13. So long as men are impatient of the least
contradiction, cannot brook to have their opinions gainsaid, their advises
rejected, their apparent excesses reproved; will not pass by the smallest
frailties in their brother without some clamor, or scorn, or censure; but
rather break out upon every slight occasion into words or actions of fury and
distemper: it Unity among brethren, which our Apostle here wishes for, and
every good man heartily desires. No! Patience is the true peacemaker. It is
the Prove. 15.1. -- (...). Homer. Iliad. (...). Eccl. 7.8.
soft answer that breaks wrath: (cross and thwarting language rather
strengthens it.) As a flint is sooner broken with a gentle stroke upon a
feather-bed, then stricken with all the might against a hard coggle. Better is
the end of a thing, (Solomon again) then the beginning: and the patient in
spirit is better then the proud in spirit. The proud in spirit belike; he is
the boutefeau; he is the man that begins the fray: but the patient in spirit
is the man that must end it, the better work, and the greater honor to him
that does it.

19. And as Patience is a special help to unity: so is Comfort a special fruit
and Effect thereof. Phil. 2.1.2.
St Paul therefore conjureth the Philippians, by all the hope they had of
comfort in God, to be at one among themselves. (...). If there be any
consolation in Christ, Psa. 133.1. etc.
if any comfort of love -- Fulfill ye my joy, that ye be like-minded, etc. Ecce
quam bonum, David in Psalm 133. Behold how good and pleasant a thing it is,
brethren to dwell together in saying both, he says all. Good and pleasant:
that is, both profitable (like the dew upon the mountains, that makes the
grass spring;) and comfortable (as the smell of a precious ointment:) And what
can the heart of man desire more? That for the Choice.

20. For the Conjunction then; it may be demanded secondly, why the Apostle
should join these two together, Patience and Consolation: there seeming to be
no great affinity between them. They are things that differ toto genere: for
Patience is a Grace, or Virtue; and Consolation a Blessing, or Reward. Is it
not, think you, to instruct Patience shall never go without Consolation? He
that will have Patience onward, shall be sure to have comfort at the last:
Psalm. 9.18.
God will crown the grace of Patience with the blessing of Consolation. The
patient abiding of the meek shall not perish for ever, Jam. 5.10.
Psalm. 9. St James would have us set before our eyes the Prophets and Saints
for a general example of suffering affliction and of patience: -- 11.
and he commends to us one particular example there as by way of instance,
namely that of Job. [You have heard, says he, of the patience of Job, and have
seen the end of the Lord: that the Lord is pitiful and of tender mercy.] Job
held out in his patience under great trials unto and God out of pity and in his
tender mercy toward him heaped comforts upon him at the last in great
abundance. It would be well worthy our most serious meditation, to consider,
both what (by Gods grace) he did, and how (by Gods mercy) he sped. His example
in the one would be a good pattern for us of Patience: and his reward in the
other a good encouragement Consolation. This we may bide upon as a most certain
truth; that if we do our part, God will not fail on his. Be we first sure,
that we have Patience; (we must look to that, for that is our part, though not
solely, for we cannot have it without him, as was already said:) but I say, be
we first sure of that, and then we may be confident, we shall have comfort
sooner or later, in some kind or other; (trust God with that, for that is
solely his part, and he will take order for it without our further care.

21. Lastly, for the Order. It may be demanded, why the The God of Patience and
Consolation] gives patience the precedence: of Patience first, and then of
Consolation. Is not that also to teach us, that as it is a vain and causeless
fear, if a man have patience, to doubt whether he shall have comfort, yea or
no: so on the contrary it is a vain and groundless hope, if a man want
patience, to presume that yet he shall have comfort howsoever? Certainly, no
Patience, no Consolation. It is the Devils method, to set the fairer side
forwards, and to serve in the best wine first, and then after, that which is
worse. He will ^ot much put us upon the trial of our Patience at the first;
but rather comforts and contentments: but when once he has us fast, then he
turns in woe and misery upon us to overwhelme us, as a deluge. But God in his
dispensations commonly uses a quite contrary method, and deals roughliest
with us at the first. We hear of little other from him, then self-denial,
hatred from the world, taking up the Cross, and suffering persecution; exercise
enough for all the patience we can get: But then, if we hold out stoutly to the
end, at last comes joy and comfort flowing in upon us both seasonably and
plentifully, like a river. You have need of patience, says that after you have
done the will of God, you may receive the promise. Heb. 10.36.
Patience first, in doing (ey and suffering too) according to the will of God:
and then after that (but not before,) the enjoying of the Promise. Would you
know then, whether the Consolations of God belong unto you, yea or no? In
short: if you can have patience, never doubt of it: if you will not have
patience, never hope for it.

22. Thus much concerning the formality of the Prayer in those former words of
the verse [ Now the God of Patience, and of Consolation grant you.] Proceed we
now to the Matter thereof in the remainder To be like-minded one toward
another according to Christ Jesus.] Where the particulars are three. First, the
thing it self, or grace prayed for; which is Unity, or Like-mindedness [ To be
like-minded:] Secondly and Thirdly, two Conditions or Qualifications thereof:
the one in respect of the Persons One toward ] the other in respect of the
manner, [According to Christ Jesus.] Of which in their order.

23. The thing first, [ To be like-minded] (...) in the Greek. A phrase of
speech, although (to my remembrance) not found elsewhere in holy Scripture, yet
often used by S. Paul in his Epistles: to the Romans, to the Corinthians, Romans
12.16. 2 Cor. 13.11. Phil. 2.2, 3.16, 4.2. 1 Pet. 3^8.
and especially to the Philippians more then once or twice. I spare the
quotations for brevity sake. S. Peter's compound word comes nearest it, (...) [
Finally, be ye all of one minde] 1 Pet. 3. New these words, both the noune
(...) or (...) the mind, and the verb (...) to mind this or that, or to be
thus or so minded: although often judgment. sometimes to the inward
disposition of the heart will and affections, and sometimes to the manifesting
of that inward disposition by the outward carriage and behavior: yet are they
also not seldom taken at large for the whole soul and all the powers thereof,
together with all the motions and opperations of any or each of them, whether
in the apprehensive, appetitive, or executive part. And I see nothing to the
contrary, but that it may very well be taken in that largest extent in this
place. And then the thing so earnestly begged at the hand of God, is, that he
would so frame the Romans one toward another, as that there might be an
universal accord amongst them so far as was possible, both in their opinions,
affections, and conversations. [Now the God of patience and consolation grant
you to be like-minded.]

24. Like-minded, first in Opinion and judgment. It is a thing much to be
desired, and by all good means to be endeavored, that (according to our
Churches prayer) God would give to all Nations unity, peace, and concord: but
especially that all they that do confess his holy name, may also agree in the
truth of his holy word; at least wise in the main and most substantial truths.
I beseech you says S. Paul, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, 1 Cor. 1.10.
that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you;
but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind, and in the same
judgment. That is the first, Like-mindedness in judgment.

25. Like-minded secondly in heart and affection. Men's understandings are not
all of one size and temper: and even they that have the largest and the
clearest understandings, yet know but in part, and are therefore subject to
errors and mis-apprehensions. 1 Cor. 13.9.
And therefore it cannot be hoped there should be such a consonancy judgment
amongst all men, no not amongst wise and godly men; but that in many things,
yea and those sometimes of great importance, they may and will dissent one from
another unto the worlds end. But then good heed would be taken, lest by the
cunning of Satan, (who is very forward and expert to work upon such advantages)
difference in judgment should in process (...). Nazianz. orat. 25.
estrange by little and little, and at length quite alienate our affections one
from another. It is one thing to dissent from, another to be at discord with,
our brethren. It^ dissensi ab illo, (says Tully concerning himself and Cato)
ut in disjunctione sententiae, conjuncti tamen amici^ia maneremus It is
probable the whole multitude of them that believed were, but we are not sure
they were, and it is possible they might not be, all of one opinion in every
point, even in those first and primitive times: but St Luke tells us for
certain, that they were all of one heart. Act. 4.32.


26. Like-minded thirdly, in a fair and peaceable outward conversation. For
albeit through humane frailty, and amid so many scandals as are, and must be in
the world ((...)) there be not evermore that hearty entire affection, Luke 17.1.
that ought to be between Christian men; especially when they stand divided one
from another in opinion: yet should they all bear this mind, and so be at
least thus far like-minded, as to resolve to forbear all scornful and insolent
speeches and behavior, of and toward one another; without jeering, without
censuring, without provoking, without causless vexing one another, or
disturbing the public peace of the Church. For the servant of God must not
strive, 2 Timothy 2.24, 25.
but be gentle unto all men, and patient. So gentle and patient, that he must
study to win them that not by reviling, but instructing them: and that not in a
loud and lofty strain, (unless when there is left no other remedy;) but first,
(and if that will serve the turn, only) in love and with meekness. Our
conversation, where it cannot be all out so free and familiar, should yet be
fair and amiable. Gods holy truth we must stand for, I grant, if it be opposed,
to the utmost of our strength: neither may we betray any part thereof by our
silence or softness, for any man's pleasure or displeasure; where we may help
it, and where the defense of it appears to be prudentially necessary. Yet
even in that case ought we so to maintain the truth of despise the persons of
men. We are to follow the truth in love: Ephesians. 4.15.
which is then best done, when holding us close to the truth, we are ready yet
in love to our brethren to do them all the rights, and to perform unto them all
those respects, which (without confirming them in their errors) may any way
fall due unto them.

27. It is a perfect and a blessed Unity, when all the three meet together;
unity of true Doctrine, unity of loving affection, and unity of peaceable
conversation: and this perfection ought to be both in our aims, and in our
endeavors. But if (through our own weakness, waywardness of others) we cannot
attain to the full perfection of the whole, Cicer. in orat.
having faithfully endeavored it: pulchrum est in secundis terti^sve, it will
be some commendation and comfort to us, to have attained so much as we could.
(...) Phil. 3.) Nevertheless whereunto we have attained, Phil. 3.16.
let us mind the same thing.

28. To quicken us hereunto (the duty being so needful, and we withal so
dull:) these few things following would be taken into consideration. Consider
first, that by our Christian calling we are all made up into one mystical body,
(...): and that by such a real, (though mysterious) concorporation, Ephesians. 3.6.
as that we become thereby (...), as all of us members of Christ, Romans 12.5.
so every one of us one another members. Now the sympathy and supply, that is
between the members of the natural body for their mutual comfort and the
mystical body of the Church, in 1 Cor. 12. at large. It were a thing
prodigiously unnatural, and to every man's apprehension the effect of a frenzy
at the least, to see one member of the body fall a bearing or tearing another.
No! if any one member, be it never so mean and despicable, be in anguish, the
rest are sensible of it. No terms of betterness are then stood upon, ( I am
better then thou, or I then thou;) no terms of defiance heard, ( I have no
need of thee, nor I of thee:) But they are all ready to contribute their
several supplies, according to their several abilities and measures, to give
ease and relief to the grieved part; (...), as the reason is given at verse 25.
there, that so there might be no rent, no schism, no division or disunion of
parts in the body.

29. Consider secondly, That by our condition we are all fellow-brethren, and
fellow servants in the same family; Gal. 6.10.
of the household of faith all: and these are obliging relations. We ought
therefore so to behave our selves in the house of God, 1 Timothy 3.15.
which is the Church of the living God, Gal. 4.27.
as becomes fellow-brethren that are descended from the same Father, and
fellow servants that live under the same Master. We one livery: having all put
on Christ, 1 Cor. 10.3, 4.
by solemn profession at our holy Baptism. We are fed at one table: eating the
same spiritual meat, and drinking the same spiritual drink, in the holy
Communion. Every thing that belongs to this house breaths union. One body,
one spirit, one calling, one hope, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptism, Ephesians. 4.3.
-- 6.
one God and Father of all: as the Apostle urges it, Ephesians. 4. concluding
thence, that therefore we ought to be at one among our selves, endeavoring to
keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace. Any of us would think it a
very disorderly house, and ill-governed; if coming in by chance we should find
the children and servants all together by the ears, though but once. How much
more then, if we should snarling and quarrelling one with another, and beating
and kicking one another. Joseph thought he need say no more to his brethren, to
prevent their falling out by the way in their return home-ward, then to remind
them of this, Genesis 45.24.
that they were all one man's children. And Abraham, Genesis 13.8.
to procure an everlasting amnesty and utter cessation thenceforth of all
debate between nephew Lot and their servants; made use of this one argument, as
the most prevalent of all other for that end, that they were Brethren. Psalm.
133.1.
Ecce quam bonum (I cannot but repeat it once more) Behold how good and joyful
a thing it is, brethren to dwell together in unity.

30. Consider thirdly, how peace and unity forwardeth the work of God for the
building up of his Church; which faction and division on the other side
obstructeth, so as nothing more. When all the workmen intend the main business,
each in his place and office performing his appointed task with cheerfulness
and good the work goes on, and the building gets up apace. But where one man
draws one way, and another another way; one will have things done after this
fashion, another after that; when one makes, and another marreth; now one
sets up, by and by comes another and plucketh all down again, how is it
possible, whilst things go thus, that ever the building should be brought to
any perfection, or handsomness. The Apostle well understood what he said, when
in the foregoing Chapter he joined Peace and Edification together, (...), Let
us follow after the things that make for peace, Romans 14.19.
and things wherewith we may edify one another. Where the hearts and tongues
of the builders are divided: building will either come to nothing, or prove but
a Babel of confusion. Jam. 3 16.
For where envying and strife is, there is confusion, and every evil work.
Strife, you see, makes ill work: it builds up nothing, unless it be the
walls of Babel. It is peace and concord, that builds up the walls of
Jerusalem: which, as it has its name from Peace, so has it its beauty also
and perfection from Peace. And then, but not before, shall Jerusalem be built
as a City that is at unity in it self; Psalm. 122.3.
when they that build Jerusalem are at unity first among themselves.

31. Consider fourthly, what heartning is given, and what advantage the enemy
abroad, whilst there are fractions and distractions at home. Per discordias
civiles externi tollunt animos, said the Historian once of old Rome. ^ Livi.
And it was the complaint of our country man Gildas, uttered long since with
much grief concerning the state of this Island, then embroyled in civil wars;
fortis ad civilia bella, Gild* de excid. Brit.
infirma ad retundenda hostium tela. That by how much more her valor and
strength was spent upon her self, in the managing of intestine and domestic
broiles: the more she laid her self, open to the incursions and outrages of
foreign enemies. The common Enemies to the truth of Religion, are chiefly
Atheism, and Superstition: Atheism opposing it in the forefront, and
Superstition on both hands. If either of which at any time get ground of us,
(as whilst we wrangle, God knows what they may do:) we may thank our own
contentions for it most. We may cherish jealousies, and frame chimera's of
other matters and causes out of our fancies or fears. But the very truth is,
there is no such scandal to enemies of all sorts, as are our home-differences,
and chiefly those (which makes it the sadder business) that are about
indifferent things. Alas, whereto serves all this ado about gestures, and
vestures, and other outward rites and formalities: that for such things as
these are (things in their own nature indifferent, and never intended to be
otherwise imposed, then as matters of circumstance and order) men should
clamor against the times, desert their ministerial functions and charges, fly
out of their own country as out of Babylon, stand at open defiance against
lawful authority, and sharpen petulancy (that I say not virulency,) as some
have done, to maintain their stiffeness and obstinacy therein? I say, whereto
serves all this, but to give scandal to the Enemies of our Church and
Religion?

32. Scandal first, to the Atheist. Who till all men be of one Religion, and
agreed in every point thereof too, (which I doubt will never be whilst the
world lasts:) thinks it the best wisdom, to be of none; and makes it his
best pastime to jeere at all. Great scandal also secondly to the Romanist. Who
is not a little the Catholikeness of the Roman faith; when he hears so many
of the things, which have been and still are retained in the Church of England
in common with the Church of Rome; as they were transmitted both to them and us
in a continued line of succession, from our godly and Orthodox forefathers, who
lived in the ages next after Christ and his Apostles, to be now inveighed
against and decryed as Popish and Superstitious. And when he sees men
pretending to piety, purity, and reformation more then others, not contenting
themselves with those just exceptions that had been formerly taken by the
Church of England and her regular Doctrines and forms of worship taught and
practiced in the Church of Rome, and endeavored to be unduly and by her sole
authority imposed upon other Churches; to be so far transported with a spirit
of contradiction, as that they care not, so as they may but run far enough
from Rome, whither or how far they run, although they should run themselves
(as too often they do) quite beyond the bounds of Truth, Allegiance, common
reason, and even common humanity too.

33. But especially and thirdly, great Scandal to those of the separation. Who
must needs think very jollily of themselves, and singular way, when they shall
find those very grounds whereon they have raised their Schism, to be so
stoutly pleaded for by some, who are yet content to hold a kind of communion
with us. Truly I could wish it were sufficiently considered by those whom it so
nearly concerns, (for my own part, I must confess, I could nevet be able to
comprehend it) with what satisfaction to the conscience any man can hold those
principles, without the maintenance inconformity in point of Ceremony and
Church Government; and yet not admit of such conclusions naturally issuing
thence, as will necessarily enforce an utter separation. Vae mundo, says our
Savior, Woe unto the world because of offenses. Mat. 18.7.
It is one of the great trials, wherewith it is the good pleasure of God to
exercise the faith and patience of his servants whilst they live on the earth;
that there will be divisions and offenses: and they must abide it. But vae
homini though: without repentance woe to the man, by whom the occasion comes.
Much have they to answer for the while, that cannot keep themselves quiet, when
they ought and might; but by restless provocations trouble both themselves and
others: to the great prejudice and grief of their brethren, but advantage and
rejoicing of the common Enemy.

34. Thus much for the Thing it self, Like-mindedness: The conditions or
Qualifications follow. The former whereof concerns the Persons: (...) [one
toward another.] It notes such an agreement, as is both Universal, and Mutual.
Universal first. I doubt not, but in the then Roman Church, at the time when
this Epistle was written, the strong agreed well enough among themselves, and
were all a like-minded, and so the weak among themselves, alike-minded too.
They all minded to despise these: these all minded to judge them. But that
agreement was with those only of their own party; and so a partial agreement:
which tended rather to the holding up of a faction, then to the making up of an
Union. It was an universal agreement, the Apostle desired and prayed for: that
the strong would be more compassionate to the Weak, and the weak more
charitable toward the Strong; both Weak and Strong more patient and moderate,
and more respective either of other in all brotherly mutual condescensions.

35. It is our fault too most an end. We are partial to those (...). Nazi.
orat. 14.
side we take to, beyond all reason: ready to justify those enterprises of
theirs that look very suspiciously, and to excuse or at least to extenuate
their most palpable excesses; and as ready on the other side to misconstrue the
most justifiable actions of the adverse part, but to aggravate to the utmost
their smallest and most pardonable aberrations. Thus do we sometimes both at
once, (either of which alone is an abomination to the Lord) justify the
guilty, Prove. 17.15.
and condemn the innocent. Whilst partial affections corrupt our judgments,
and will not suffer us to look upon the actions of our brethren, with an equal
and indifferent eye. But let us beware of it partialities and prejudices, we
shall never rightly perform our duties either to God or man. That therefore the
agreement may be as it ought to be: we must resolve to be patient (not toward
some, 1 These. 5.24.
but) toward all men, 1 These. 5. to be gentle (not unto unto all men. 2 Timothy
2.24.
2 Timothy 2. to show all meekness (not to some, but) to all men, Titus 3.2. The
concord should be Universal. Tit. 3.2.


36. It should likewise be Mutual. (...) imports that also: (...). Homer.
Iliad. (...).
either part being ready for charity sake to contemperate and accommodate
themselves to other, so far as reason requires. But herein also, as in the
former; men's corrupt partiality bewraieth it self extremely. The strong Romans
like enough could discern a censorious spirit in the weaker one; and the weak
ones perhaps as easily a disdainful spirit in them. But neither of both (it is
to be doubted) were willing enough to look into the other end of the wallet,
own spirits. We use to say, -- id manticae quod in tergo.
If every man would mend one, all would be well. Ey would? How comes it to
pass then, that all has not been well even long ago? For where is the man,
that is not ready to mend one? One, said I? yea ten; yea a hundred! why, here
it is: every man would be mending one; but not the right one. He would be
mending his brother: but he will not mend himself. Vt nemo in sese tentat
descendere! O says the strong, we should soon agree; but that he is so
censorious: and yet himself flouteth as freely as ever he did. We should hit it
very well, says the weak, were not he so scornful: and yet judges as deeply
as ever he did. Oh the falsness and hypocrisy of men's hearts blinded with
self-love! how it abuses them with strong delusions, and so fills the world
with divisions and offenses.

37. For this, our blessed Savior, who has best discovered the malady, has
also prescribed the best remedy. The disease is Hypocrisy. The Symptoms are.
One to be cat-eyed outward, Luke 6.41. -- 42.
in readily espying somewhat, (the smallest moat cannot escape) in a brothers
eye: another, to be bat-eyed inward, in not perceiving (be it never so great) a
beam in a man's own eye; a third, a forwardness to be with his brothers eye, and
offering his service to help him out with the moat there, before he think a
thought of doing any thing toward the clearing of his own eye. The Remedy is,
to begin at home: do but put the things into their right order; and the
business is done. Tu conversus, confirma fratres. -- 28.33.
Strengthen thy brethren what thou can: it is a good office, and would not be
neglected. But there is something more needful to be done then that; and to be
done first and before that, and which if it be first done thou will be able to
do that much the better ( then shall thou see clearly) and that is to reform
thy self: be sure first thy self be converted, -- (...).
weak brother as thou see cause, Luke 6.42.
and strengthen him.

38. Let them that are so forward to censure the actions of others, especially
of their Superious, and are ever and anon complaining how ill things are
carried above; but never take notice of their own frauds, and oppressions, and
sacriledges, and insolences, peevishnesses, and other enormities: let them
turn their eye homeward another while, observe how their own pulses beat, and
go learn what that is, Luke 6.42.
Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye. We deal not like
Christians, no nor like reasonable men, if we expect all men should come to our
bent in every thing; and we our selves not relent from our own stiffness in the
least matter for their sakes. Believe it, we shall never grow to Christian
Unanimity in any tolerable measure, so long as every man seeks but to please
himself only, in following his own liking; and is not desirous withal
(according to our Apostles exhortation verse 2.) please his neighbor also, by
condescending to his desires, where it may be for his good, in any thing that
is not either unlawful, or unreasonable. The inclinations to agreement should
be mutual, that so we might be like-minded (...).

49. And then all this must be (...): which is the other qualification in the
Text, and now only remains to be spoken of. According to Christ Jesus. Which
last clause is capable of a double interpretation: pertinent to the scope of
the Text, and useful for our direction in point of practice, both; and
therefore neither of both to be rejected. Some understand it, as a Limitation
Unity, which was prayed for in the former words: and not unfitly. For lest it
should be conceived, that all the Apostle desired in their behalf was, that
they should be like-minded one toward another howsoever: he might intend by
the addition of this clause to show, that it was not such an Unity as he
desired, unless it were according to Truth and Godliness in Christ Jesus. There
may be an agreement in falso; when men hold together for the maintenance of one
and the same Common Error. Such as is the agreement of Heretics, of
Schismatics, of Sectaries, among themselves. And there may be an agreement in
malo; when men combine together mischievous design: as did those forty and
odd, Act. 23.12, -- 13
that bound themselves with a curse to destroy Paul. Such is the agreement of
-- (...). Nazianz. orat. 14.
Thieves, of Cheaters, of Rebels, among themselves. Such -- delicta fuere Nexus
amicitiae. Claudi* ii.2. in Ruffin. Mat. 12.26.
agreements as these, no man ought to pray for: indeed no man need to pray for.
The wisdom of the flesh, and cunning of the Devil, will bring men on fast
enough to those cursed agreements; without which he and his know well enough
his kingdom cannot stand. The servants of God have rather bent themselves
evermore by their prayers and endeavors, to dissolve the glue, and to break
the confederacies of the ungodly. Destroy their tongues, O Lord, and divide
them, is holy David's prayer Psalm. 55. And S. Paul when he stood before the
Sanhedrim at Jerusalem, Psalm. 55.9. Act. 23.6.
to take off his malicious accusers the better, perceiving both the Judges and
bystanders to be of two different factions, some Pharisees, who believed a
resurection, and other-some Sadduces, who denied it; did very wisely to cast a
bone among them: When by proclaiming himself a Pharisee, and professing his
belief of the resurrection, -- 7.
he raised such a dissension between the two factions, that the whole multitude
was divided; -- 10.
insomuch as the chief Captain was fain to use force to get Paul from amid the
uprore, and to carry him away: by which means all their intended proceedings
against him were stopped for that time.

40. But the Unity, that is to be prayed for, and to be labored for in the
Christian Church, is a Christian Unity: that is to say, a happy concord in
walking lovingly together in the same path of Truth and Godliness. The word of
Christ is the word of truth: Col. 1.5. 1 Timothy 3.16.
and the mystery of Christ, the mystery of Godliness. Whatsoever therefore is
contrary to either of these, ( Truth, or Godliness) cannot be (...), according
to Christ; but rather altogether against him. Here then we have our bounds set
us: our Ne plus ultra, beyond which if we pass, we transgress and are
exorbitant. Alas for us the while, when ever our good desires may deceive us,
if they be inordinate; and the love of so lovely a thing as Peace is, mis-lead
us. The more need have we to look narrowly to our the tempter should have laid
a snare for us in a way wherein we suspected it not, and so surprise us ^re we
be aware. Vsque ad aras: The altar-stone, that is the meer-stone. All bonds of
friendship, all offices of neighborhood, must give way, when the honor of God
and his truth lie at the stake. If peace will be had upon fair terms, or indeed
upon any terms (salvis veritate and pietate) without impeachment of either of
these; it ought to be embraced. But if it will not come but upon harder
conditions; better let it go: A man may buy gold too dear. Follow peace with
all men; Heb. 12.14.
and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord. The gender of the
article there shows the meaning: not (...), without which but (...) without
which holiness no man shall see the Lord. Without peace some man may, having
faithfully endeavored it, though he cannot obtain it, (for that is not his
fault:) but without holiness (which if any man want, it is through his own
fault only,) no man shall see the Lord. Our like-mindedness then must be
according to Christ Jesus in this first sense; that is, so far forth as may
stand with Christian truth and godliness.

41. But very many Expositors do rather understand the phrase in another sense.
According to Christ; that is, according to the example which seems to have
been the judgment of our last Translators, who have therefore so put it in the
margent of your Bibles. His Example the Apostle had reserved unto the last
place, as one of the weightiest and most effectual arguments in this business:
producing it a little before the Text, verse 3. -- 7.
and repeating it again a little after the Text. So as this Prayer may seem
(according to this interpretation) to be an illustration of that argument,
which was Christ's Example: as if he had said. Christ sought not himself, but
us. He laid aside his own glory, divested himself of Majesty and Excellency,
that he might condescend to our baseness, and bear our infirmities: -- 7.
he did not despise us, but received us with all meekness and compassion. Let
not us therefore seek every man to please himself, in going his own way, and
setting up his own will; neither let us despise any man's weakness: -- 1.
but rather, treading in the steps of our blessed Lord Jesus, -- 2.
let every one of us strive to please his neighbor for his good unto
edification; -- 1.
bearing with the infirmities of our weaker brethren, -- 7.
and receiving one another in our inwardest even as* Christ also received us to
the glory of God.

42. If the examples of the servants of Christ ought not to be lightly set by,
how much more ought the Example of the Master himself to sway with every good
Christian? In 1 Cor. 10. St Paul having delivered an exhortation in general,
the same in effect with that we are now in hand withal, verse 24. ( Let no man
seek his own, but every man another wealth:) he does after propose to their
imitation in that point his own particular practice and example in the last
verse of the Chapter, [ Even as I please all men in all things, says he, not
seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved:]
himself, and that we might know how unsafe a thing it were to rest barely upon
his, or any other man's example: in the very next following words, the first
words of the next Chapter, he leads them higher, and to a more perfect
example, even that of Christ [ Be ye followers of me, says he, as I also am of
Christ.] As if he had said, Although my example, who am as nothing, be little
considerable in it self: yet wherein my example is guided by the example of
Christ, you may not despise it. The original record only is authentical, and
not the transcript: yet may a transcript be creditable, when it is signed and
attested Concordat cum originali under the hand of a public notary or other
sworn officer: I do not therefore lay mine own example upon you, as a Rule; I
only set it before you, as a help or Encouragement: that you may the more
cheerfully follow the Example of Christ, when you shall see men, subject to the
same sinful infirmities with your selves, by the grace of God to have done the
same before you. My example only shows the thing to be feisable: it is
Christ's Example only, that can render it warrantable. Be ye therefore followers
of me, even as I also am of Christ.

43. Here just occasion is offered me, (but I may not take it, first and more
generally of a very profitable Enquiry, in what things and how far forth we are
astricted to follow the example of Christ. And then secondly and more
particularly, what especial directions to take from his example, for the
ordering likemindedness one toward another, of which we have hitherto spoken.
But I remit you over for both, to what our Apostle has written Phil. 2. in the
whole forepart of the Chapter. The whole passage is very well worthy the
pondering: and his discourse therein may serve as a Commentary upon a good part
of this Text. I therefore commend it to your private meditation; and you, and
what you have heard, to the good blessing of Almighty God: and that with St
Paul's votive prayer or benediction here; (for I know not where to fetch a
better.)

Now the God of Patience and Consolation grant you to be like-minded one
toward another, according to Christ Jesus. That you may with one mind and one
mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. To whom etc.
BARWICK, JULY 1639.
1 Timothy 3.16. And without all Controversy great is the mystery of


1. THe Ordination of Bishops, Priests, and Deacons' being one of the principal
acts of the Episcopal power: our Apostle therefore instructs Timothy, (whom
he had ordained See Hieron. in Catal. Cap. 11. Eusebius. 3. hist. Ecccl. cap. 4.
Council. Chalced. Act. 11.
Bishop of Ephesus, the famous Metropolis of that part of Asia) somewhat fully,
what he was to do in that so weighty an affair. What manner of persons and how
qualified he should assume in partem curae, to assist him in his pastoral
charge, for the service of Gods Church and the propagation of the Gospel. Which
having done at large from the beginning of the Chapter unto the end of verse
13. he rendereth a reason at verse 14. why he had insisted so long upon upon
that argument: even, lest the Church of God (in his absence) should be the
Gospel. At Ephesus the hand of God had opened a wide door (1 Cor. 16.) but
withal Satan (as his manner is) had stirred up many adversaries; 1 Co. 16.9.
and some of them very wild ones, more like savage beasts, then men: (...) is
the word for it, 1 Cor. 15.32.
1 Cor. 15. It was at Ephesus, that he fought with beasts in the shape of men.
Witness Demetrius the silver-smith; and that Bellua multorum capitum, the mad
giddy multitude in a tumultuous assembly, all in an uprore, and no man well
wist for what. Acts 19.32.
Act. 19. Here was work enough to be done. The door must be held open, to let
converts in: but it must be well keep adversaries out. All this not to be done,
but with many hands: The harvest being great, the laborers had not need be few.

2. The only thing, that might perhaps make Timothy put off Ordination somewhat
the longer, might be the expectation of the Apostles coming; to whom he might
think fit to reserve that honor: as to one able (by reason of his Apostolic
spirit) to make choice of meet persons for the Churches service with better
certainty then himself could do. The Apostle therefore tells him for that,
That true it is, Verse 14. and chap. 4.13.
he had an earnest desire of a long time, and still had a full purpose (if God
would) to be with him ere long: Yet because future events; that was not a thing
for him to rely upon so, as in expectance thereof to delay the doing of any
service needful for the Church of Christ. For who could tell how it might
please God to dispose of him? Or whether the necessities of other Churches
might not require his personal presence and pains rather elsewhere? He would
not therefore he should stay for him: but go in hand with it himself with all
convenient care and speed. All this appears in the 2 verses next before the
Text; [ These things wrote I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly. But
if I tarry long, that yet thou may know how to behave thy self in the house

3. This seems to be the Scope and Contexture of the whole foregoing part of
the Chapter, and then immediately fall in the words of the Text, [And without
all cantroversie, great is the mystery of Godliness etc. Which seem to have but
a very slender dependence upon the foregoing discourse: and indeed no more they
have. For the Apostle having in the end of the fifteenth verse, (and that but
incidentally neither) mentioned the word Truth: he thereupon takes occasion in
this sixteenth verse, a little and briefly Truth. The whole verse contains
Evangelij Encomium, and Compendium: A brief description of the Nature in the
former part: and a brief summary of the Doctrine of the Gospel in some
remarkable heads thereof, in the later part of the verse.

Quid, Quantum, and Quale. First, Quid: what is Christianity? (...). It is a
mystery. But there are greater, and there are lesser Mysteries: Quantum
therefore? Of the bigger sort sure. (...), a Great Mystery: (...), by all
confessions, and without all contradiction or controversy Great. But the
greater the worse, if it be not good as well as great. Quale therefore? What a
kind of Mystery is it? (...), It is a Mystery of Piety or Godliness.
CHRISTIANITY IS THE GREAT MYSTERY OF GODLINES^: That is the total. Now to the
Parts: and first of the Quid; The Gospel a Mystery. But then first, What is a
Mystery? for the Quid Nominis: and then why the Gospel a Mystery? for the Quid
Rei. The Word first, then the Thing.

5. For the Word (...), I find sundry conceits ready collected to my hand by
v. Casaubon. exercit 16.43. Martin. Lexic. philol. verb. Mysterium.
learned man, out of the writings of the Greek Fathers, and out of the
commentaries of Grammarians and Critics both ancient and modern: whereof I
spare the recital, because it would neither much conduce to my present purpose,
nor profit the present auditory. The word is clearly of a Greek from (...), or
(...), to shut the eye or mouth. Of all the mysterious rites used among the
Heathen, the Eleusinia sacra were the most ceremonious and mysterious: in so
much as that, when in their writings, the word (...) is used by it self without
any farther specification, it is ordinarily conceived to be meant of those
Eleusinian mysteries. These none might be present at, but they that were
solemnly initiated thereunto: who upon their first admission, (which yet was
but to the outer and lesser mysteries,) were called (...). And if after a
sufficient time of probation, (a twelvemoneth was the least,) they were
adjudged meet to be admitted the greater and more secret mysteries, they were
then called (...): Whereto there seems to be some -- (...).
allusion (as there is frequently to sundry other customs and usages of the
Heathens) even in the holy scriptures themselves. But whether they were
admitted to their lesser or the greater mysteries, 2 Pet. 1.16.
strait order was evermore taken with them, by Oaths, Penalties, and otherwise,
as strong as could be devised; that they should by no means reveal any of the
passages or rites thereunto belonging, to those that were (...), and not
initiated: whom in that respect they counted profane. To do otherwise, was
reputed so heinous a irreligious and piacular then that. Quis Cereris ritus
audet vulgar profanis? He knew not where to find a man, that durst presume so
to do. Vetabo qui Cereris sacrum Vulgarit arcanae, Mor. 3. Carm. 2.
sub ijs Deus Sit trabibus -- roof, or to put to sea in the same vessel, with
him that were guilty of such an high provocation, as the divulging abroad of
the sacred mysteries: lest some vengeance from the offended Deities should
overtake them for their impiety, (and him for company,) to their destruction.
It was in very deed the Devils cunning, one of the depths of Satan, and one of
the most advantageous mysteries of his arts, by that secrecy to hold up a
reverend and religious esteem of those mysteries, which were so repleat with
all filthy and impious abominations: that, if they should have been made known
to the world, it must needs have exposed their whole religion, to the contempt
of the vulgar, and to the of the wiser sort.

6. Such and no better, were those mysteria sacra among the Heathens: whence
the word Mystery had its birth and rise. Both the Name and Thing being so
vi^ely abused by them: it yet pleased the holy spirit of God to make choice of
that word, whereby usually in the New Testament to express that holy Doctrine
of Truth and Salvation, which is revealed to us in the Gospel of grace. By the
warrant of whose example, the ancient Church, both Greek and Latin, took the
liberty (as what hinders but they might?) to make use of sundry words and
phrases, fetched from the very dregs Paganism, for the better explication of
sundry points of the Christian Faith; and to signify their notions of sundry
things of Ecclesiastical usage to the people. The Greek Church has constantly
used this word (...); a heathenish superstitious word: and the Latin Church in
like manner the word Sacramentum, a heathen military word: to signify thereby
the holy Sacraments of the Christian Church. I note it the rather; and I have
therefore stood upon it a little longer, then was otherwise needful: to let
you know that the godly and learned Christians of those Primitive times, were
not so fondly shy and scrupulous, (as supercilious (I might say, and
superstitious too) as to cry down and condemn for evil, and even eo nomine
utterly unlawful, the use of all such whether names or things, as were
invented, or have been abused by Heathens or Idolaters.

7. But this by the way. I return to the word (...). Which, being rarely found
in the Greek version of the Old Testament, (indeed not at all, so far as my
search serves me, save only some few times in Daniel,) is frequently used in
the New: and that for the most part to signify, Dan. 2.18. and 4.9.
(for now I come to the Quid Rei) either Doctrine of the Gospel, or some
special branches thereof, or the dispensations of Gods providence for the time
or manner of reveiling it. To you it is given to know the mysteries of the
kingdom of God. Mat. 13.11. 1 Cor. 2.7.
Mat. 13. We speak the wisdom of God in a mystery. 1 Cor. 2. So the mystery of
Christ, Col. 4.3.
Col. 4. mystery of Faith in this chapter at the ninth verse; and here in the
Text, The Mystery of Godliness.

8. But why a Mystery? That I shall now show you. First, when we see something
good or bad done plainly before our eyes, yet cannot imagine to what end or
purpose it should tend, nor can guess what should be the design or intention
of the doer: that we use to call a Mystery. The Counsels of Princes and affairs
of State ( Ragioni di stato, Arcana Imperij.
as the Italians call it) when they are purposely carried in a cloud of
secrecy, that the reasons and ends of the actions may be hidden from the eyes
of men, are therefore called the Mystery and upon the same ground sundry
manual crafts are called Mysteries: for that there belong to the exercise of
them some secrets, which they that have not been trained up therein cannot so
well understand, and they that have been trained up therein, could like well
that none but themselves should understand. In a worser sense also it is not
seldom used. If some crafty companion, with whom we have had little dealings
formerly, should begin of a sudden to apply himself to us in a more then
ordinary manner, with great shows and proffers of kindness, and we know no
particular reason why he should so do: we presently conclude in our thoughts,
mystery or other in it; that is, that he has some secret ends, some design
upon us, which we understand not. Josephus writing of Antipater the son of
Herod, who was a most wicked mischievous person, but withal a notable
dissembler; very cunning and close, and one that could carry matters marvelous
smoothly and fairly to the outward appearance, so that the most intelligent
and cautious men could not escape, but he would sometimes reach beyond them to
their destruction: he says of him, and his whole course of life, that it was
(...). Joseph de bell. Iudaic. lib. 1.
(...), nothing but mystery of wickedness

9. In this notion, (in the better sense of it,) may the great work of our
Redemption by Jesus Christ, which is the very pith and marrow of the Gospel, be
called a Mystery. Who that should have seen a child of a span long, to be born
in an Inn, of a mean parentage, coursely swadled up, and cradled in a manger:
and then afterward to be brought up under a Carpenter, and to live in a poor
and low condition, scarce worth a room where to rest his head; and after all
that to be bought and sold, buffeted, spit on, reviled, tortured, condemned,
and executed as a Malefactor, with as much weak hinges should have moved the
greatest act of Power, Wisdom, and Goodness, that ever was, or ever shall be
done in the world; that such contemptible means should serve to bring about the
eternal good will and purpose of God toward mankind? yet so it was whiles
Judas the Jews contriving Christ's death, (he to satisfy his Covetousness, and
they their Malice;) and all those other that had any hand in the business were
looking every man but at his own private ends: all this while was this Mystery
working. Unawares indeed to them, (and therefore no thanks to them for it, nor
benefit to them from it,) but yet by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge
of God: Act. 2.23.
who most wisely and powerfully ordered all those various and vicious motions
of the creature, for the effectuating of his own most glorious and gracious
purposes. That is one Reason.

10. Secondly, we use to call all such things Mysteries, as cannot revealed
unto us: whether they have or have not, otherwise any great difficulty in them.
Nebuchadnezzars dream is so called -- (...).
a Mystery, Dan. 2. And S. Paul in one place speaking of the conversion of the
Jews, calls it a Mystery, (I would not Brethren, that you should be ignorant
of this Mystery, Dan. 2.18. Romans 11.25.
Romans 11.) and in another place, speaking of the change of those that should be
found alive at Christ's second coming, 1 Cor. 15.51.
calls that a Mystery too, ( Behold I show you a Mystery; we shall not all
dye etc. 1 Cor. 15.) In this notion a Mystery: it being utterly impossible that
any wit of man, by the light of Nature, or strength of humane discourse, should
have been able to have found out that way which Almighty God has appointed for
our salvation; if it had not pleased him to have made it known to the world by
supernatural revelation. The wisest Philosophers, and learned Rabbis, nor
did nor could ever have dreamt of any such thing; till God revealed it to his
Church by his Prophets and Apostles. This mystery was hid from ages and from
generations, Col. 1.26. 1 Cor. 2.8, 10.
nor did any of the Princes of this world know it in any of those ages or
generations; as it is now made manifest to us, God revealed it to us by his
spirit, as our Apostle elsewhere speaks.

11. The Philosophers indeed saw (a little, dimly,) some of those truths that
are more clearly revealed to us in the Scriptures. They found in all men a
great proclivity to Evil, and an indisposition to Good: but knew nothing at
all, either of the true Causes or of the right remedies thereof. Some
apprehensions also they had of a Deity, of the Creation of the world, of a
divine providence, of the immortality of the soul, of a final retribution to
be awarded to all men by a divine justice according to the merit of their
truths. But those more high and mysterious points, especially those two, that
of the Trinity of persons in the Godhead, and that of the Incarnation of the
Son of God, ((...) and (...), as the Greek Fathers use to call them;) together
with those appendices of the later, the Redemption of the the Justification of
a sinner, the Resurrection of the body, and the beatifical Vision of God and
Christ in the kingdom of Heaven: not the least thought of any of these deep
things of God ever came within them; God not having revealed the same unto them.

12. It is no thanks then to us, that very children among us do believe and
confess these high mysterious points, whereof Plato and Aristotle and all the
other grand Sophies among them were ignorant: since we owe our whole knowledge
herein, not to our own natural sagacity or industry (wherein they were beyond
most of us) but to divine and supernatural revelation. Matthew. 16.17.
For flesh and blood has not revealed them unto us, but our Father which is in
heaven. We see saw not: not because our eyes are better then theirs, but
because God has vouchsafed to us a better light then he did to them. Which
being an act of special grace ought therefore to be acknowledged with special
thankfulness. Our Savior has given us the example, I thank thee, O Father,
Lord of heaven and earth, because thou have hid these things from the wise and
prudent, and have revealed them unto babes, Mat. 11.25.

13. Truly much cause we have to bless the holy Name of God, that he has given
us to be born of Christian parents, and to be the Christian Church: where we
have been initiated into these sacred mysteries; being catechized and
instructed in the doctrine of the Gospel out of the holy Scriptures, even from
our very childhood, as Timothy was. (...).
But we are wretchedly unthankful to so good a God, and extremely unworthy of
so great a blessing: 2 Timothy 3.15.
if we murmur against our Governors, and clamor against the Times, because
every thing is not point-vise just as we would have it, or as we have fancied
to our selves it should be. Whereas, were our hearts truly thankful, although
things should be really and in truth even ten times worse, then now they are
but in their conceit only: yet so long as we may enjoy the Gospel in any
(though never so scant measure, and with any (though never so hard) conditions,
we should account it a benefit and mercy invaluable. (...), so St Paul esteemed
it, the very riches of the grace of God: for he writes, [ According to the
riches of his grace, wherein he has abounded toward us, in all wisdom and
prudence, Ephesians. 1.7 -- 9.
having made known to us the mystery of his will, Ephesians. 1.] If he had not made
it known to us, we had never known it: And that is the Second Reason why a
Mystery.

14. There is yet a Third: even because we are not able perfectly to comprehend
it, now it is revealed. And this Reason will fetch in the Quantum too. For
herein especially it is that this mystery does so far transcend all other
mysteries. (...): a great, mavelous great Mystery. In the search whereof
Reason finding it self at a loss, is forced to give it over in the plain field,
and to cry out O altitudo! as being unable to reach the unfathomed depth
thereof. We believe and know, and that with as they are revealed in the holy
Scriptures; because the mouth of God (who is Truth it self, and cannot lie)
has spoken them: and our own Reason upon this ground teaches us to submit our
selves and it to the obedience of Faith, for the (...), that so it is. But then
for the (...), Joh. 3.
( Nicodemus his question, How can these things be?) it is no more possible for
our weak understandings to comprehend that, then it is for the eyes of bats or
owls to look steadfastly upon the body of the Sun, when he shines forth in his
greatest strength. The very Angels, those holy and heavenly spirits, have a
desire says S. Peter (it is but a desire, not any perfect ability; and that
but (...) neither* 1 Pet. 1.^^.
) to peep a little into those incomprehensible mysteries, and then cover their
faces with their wings, and peep again, and cover again: as being not able to
endure the fullness of that glorious luster that shines therein.

15. God has revealed himself and his good pleasure toward us in his holy
word sufficiently to save our souls; if we will believe: but not to solve all
our doubts, if we will dispute. The Scriptures being written for our sakes; it
was needful they should be fitted to our capacities: and therefore the
mysteries contained therein resemblances as we are capable of; but far short
of the nature and excellency of the things themselves. The best knowledge we
can have of them here, is but per speculum, and in aenigmate 1 Cor. 13. as it
were in a glass, and by way of riddle: 1 Cor. 13.12.
darkely both. God teaches us by the Eye in his Creatures. That is per
speculum, as it were by a glass, and that but a dim one neither: wherein we
may read (...), some of the invisible things of God; Romans 1.19, 23.
but written in small and out-worne characters, scarce legible by us. He
teaches us also by the Ear, in the preaching of his holy word: but that in
aenigmate, altogether by riddles, three distinct persons in one essence, and
two distinct natures in one person; That virginity should conceive, Eternity be
born, Immortality dye, and Mortality rise from death to life; That there should
be a finite and mortal God, or an infinite and Immortal man: What are all
these, and many other more of like intricacy, but so many riddles?

16. In all which (that I may from the premises infer something of Use) we
should but cum ratione insanire, should we go about to make our Reason the
measure of our Faith. We may as the earth in our fists, or to empty the sea
with a pitcher; as to comprehend these heavenly mysteries within our narrow
understandings. Puteus altus; the well is deep, and our buckets (for want of
cordage) will not reach near the bottom. We have use of our Reason (and they
are unreasonable, that would Religion, as well as in other things. And that not
only in Agendis, in matters of duty and morality, wherein it is of a more
necessary and constant use, as the standard to regulate our judgments in most
cases: but even in Credendis too, in such points as are more properly of Faith,
in matters doctrinal and dogmatical. But then she must be employed, only as an
handmaid to Faith; and learn to know her distance. Confer, and Infer; those
are her proper tasks: to conferr one Scripture with another, and to infer
conclusions and deduce instructions thence by clear Logical discourse. Let her
keep within these bounds; service. But we mar all if we suffer the handmaid to
bear too great a sway, to grow petulant, and to perke above the Mistress.

17. It has been the bane of the Church, and the original of the most, and the
most pernicious, errors and heresies in all ages: that men not contenting
themselves with the simplicity of believing, have doated too much upon their
own fancies; and made Reason the sole standard, whereby to measure both the
Principles and Conclusions of Faith. It is the very fundamental error of the
Socinians at this day. No less absurdly, then as if a man should take upon him
without Mathematical instruments to take the just dimensions altitudes,
magnitudes, distances, aspects, and other appearances, only by the scantling of
the Eye. Nor less dangerously, then as if a Smith (it is S. Chrysostomes
comparison) should lay by his tongs, and take the iron hot from the forge to
work it upon the anvil, Chrysostom. in 1. Cor. (...). ^.
with his bare hands. Mysteries are not to be measured by Reason. That is the
first Instruction.

18. The next is, That forasmuch as there are in the mystery of Christianity so
many things incomprehensible; it would be safe for us (for the avoiding of
Errors and Contentions, and consequently Truth and Peace,) to contain our
selves within the bounds of sobriety, without wading too far into abstruse,
curious and useless speculations. The most necessary Truths, and such as
sufficed to bring our forefathers (in the primitive and succeeding times) to
heaven, are so clearly revealed in scripture, and have been so universally and
constantly consented unto by the Christian Church in a continued succession of
times; as that to doubt of them must needs argue a spirit of pride and
singularity at least, if not also of Strife and Contradiction. But in things
less evident (and therefore also less necessary,) no man ought to ^e too stiff
in his own private opinion, or too peremptory in judging those that are
otherwise minded. But as every man would desire to be left to his own liberty
of judgment in such things: so should he be willing to leave other men to
their liberty also: at least, so long as they keep themselves quiet, without
raising quarrels, or disturbing the peace of the Church there-abouts.

19. As for example. Concerning the Entrance and Propagation of Original sin;
the Nature, Orders, and Offices of Angels; The Time, Place, and Antecedents of
the last judgment; The consistency both of Gods immutable decrees with the
contingency of second causes, and of the efficacy of Gods grace, with the
freedom of Man's will, etc. In which and other like difficult points, they that
have traveled farthest, which desire to satisfy their own curiosity, have
either dashed upon pernicious Errors, or involved themselves in inextricable
difficulties; or by Gods mercy (which is the happiest loose from such fruitless
studies,) have been thereby brought to a deeper own ignorance, and an higher
admiration of the infinite majesty and wisdom of our great God, who has set
his counsels so high above our reach, made his ways so impossible for us to
find out. That is our second Instruction.

20. There is yet another, arising from the consideration of the greatness of
this Mystery. That therefore no man ought to take offense at the discrepancy of
opinions, that is in the Churches of Christ amongst Divines, in matters of
Religion. There are men in the world, (who think themselves no babes neither)
so deeply possessed with a spirit of Atheism; that though they will be of any
Religion their turns and comply with the times: yet they are resolved to be
(indeed) of none, till all men be agreed of one: which yet never was, nor is
ever like to be. A resolution no less desperate for the soul, if not rather
much more; then it would be for the body, if a man should vow he would never
eat, till all the Clocks in the City should strike Twelve together. If we look
into the large volumes that have been written by Philosophers, Lawyers, and
Physicians: we shall find the greatest part of them spent in disputations, and
in the reciting and confuting of one another opinions. And we allow them so to
do, without prejudice to their respective professions: Sense, or Reason. Only
in Divinity, great offense is taken at the multitude of Controversies: wherein
yet difference of opinions is by so much more tolerable then in other sciences;
by how much the things about which we are conversant are of a more sublime,
mysterious, and incomprehensible nature, then are those of other Sciences.

21. Truly it would make a religious heart bleed, to consider the many and
great distractions that are all over the Christian world at this day. The
lamentable effects whereof, scarce any part of Christendom but feels more or
less: either in open wars, or seditions, or (at the best) in uncharitable
censures and ungrounded jealousies. Yet the infinite variety of men's
dispositions, inclinations, and aims considered; together with the great
obscurity that is in the things of God, and the strength of corruption that is
in us: it is to be acknowledged the admirable work of God, that these
distractions are not even much more, and greater, and many sects as are in the
world, there should be yet such an universal concurrence of judgment as there
is, in the main fundamental points of the Christian Faith. And if we were so
wise, as we might and should be, to make the right use of it: it would not
stumble us awhit in the belief of our Religion, that Christians differ so much
as they do in many things; but rather mightily confirm us in the assurances
thereof, that they agree so well as they do almost in any thing. And it may be
a great comfort to every well-meaning soul, that the simple belief of those
certain truths, whereon all parties are in a manner agreed, may be and
(ordinarily) is sufficient for the salvation of all them, who are sincerely
careful (according to that measure of light and means that has vouchsafed
them) to actuate their Faith with piety, charity and good works: so making this
great mystery to become unto them (as it is in it self) Mysterium pietatis, a
Mystery of Godliness. Which is the last point proposed; the Quale: to which I
now pass.

22. As the corrupt doctrine of Antichrist is not only a doctrine of Error, but
of Impiety too; called therefore (...) The mystery of Iniquity 2 These. 2. So
the wholesome doctrine Christ, is not only a doctrine of Truth, but of Piety
too; 2 These. 2.7.
and is therefore termed here (...), The Mystery of Godliness. Which (...) or
Godliness, since there appears not any great necessity in the Context to
restrain it to that more peculiar sense, wherein both the Greek and English
word are sometimes used; namely, to signify the right manner of Gods worship
according to his word, in opposition to all idolatrous, superstitious or false
worships practiced among the Heathens: I am the rather inclined to understand
it here, as many Interpreters have done, in the fuller latitude, as it
comprehends the whole duty of a Christian which he stands bound by the
command of God in his Law, or of Christ in his Gospel to perform.

23. Verum and Bonum, We know, are near of kin the one to the other: And the
spirit of God, who is both the author and the revealer of this mystery; as he
is the spirit of Truth Joh. 14. so is he also the spirit of Holiness Romans 1.
And it is part of his work, Joh. 14 17. Romans 1.4.
to sanctify the heart with grace, as well as to enlighten the mind with
knowledge. Our Apostle therefore sometimes mentions Truth and Godliness
together: teaching us thereby, that we should take them both into our care
together. If any man consent not to the words 1 Timothy 6.3.
and to the doctrine which is after Godliness 1 Timothy 6. And Tit. 1. --
according to the Faith of Gods elect, Tit. 1.1.
and acknowledging of the Truth which is after Godliness. And here in express
terms, The Mystery of Godliness. And that most rightly: whether we consider it
in the Scope, Parts, or Conservation of it.

24. First, the general Scope and aim of Christianity is, by the mercy of God
founded on the merits of Christ, to bring men on through Faith and Godliness to
Salvation. It was not in the purpose of God in publishing the Gospel, and
thereby freeing us from the personal obligation, rigor, and curse of the Law,
so to turn us loose and lawless, to do whatsoever should seem good in our own
eyes, follow our own crooked wills, or gratify any corrupt lust: but to oblige
us rather the faster by these new benefits, and to incite us the more
effectually by Evangelical promises, Romans 12.1.2. Cor. 7.1. etc.
to the earnest study and pursuit of Godliness. The Gospel, though upon quite
different grounds, binds us yet to our good behavior in every respect the
Law did, if not in some respects deeper: allowing no liberty to the flesh for
the fulfilling of the lusts thereof in any thing, but exacting entire sanctity
and purity, both of inward affection, and outward conversation in all those
that embrace it. The grace of God, Tit. 2.11, 12.
appearing in the revelation of this mystery, as it brings along with it an
offer of salvation to all men: so it teaches all men, that have any real
purpose to lay hold on so gracious an offer, to deny ungodliness and worldly
lusts, and to live righteously and soberly and godlily in this present world.

25. It is not to be wondered at, if all false Religions give allowance -- dare
morbo, exemplo divi^^tatis, excusatam licentiam. Senec de brevit. vit. c. 16.
ungodliness or other: when the very gods whom they worship give such
encouragements thereunto by their lewd example. The gods of the Pagans were
renowned for nothing so much, most of them, as for their vices. Mars a bloody
God; Bacchus a drunken God; Mercury a cheating God: and so proportionably in
their several kinds all the rest. Their great capital God Jupiter, guilty of
almost all the capital vices. And where the Gods are naught, who can imagine
the Religion should be good. Their very mysteria sacra (as they called them)
were so full of all wickedness and filthy abominations (as was already in part
touched) but is fully discovered by Clemens Alexandrinus, Lactantius, Arnobius,
and other of the Ancients of our religion,) that it was the wisest point in all
their religion, to take such strict order as they did, for the keeping of them
secret.

26. But it is the honor and prerogative of the Christian Religion, that it
alone allows of no wickedness: But as God himself is holy, so he requires an
holy worship, and holy worshippers. He exacteth the mortification of all evil
lusts: and the sanctification of the whole man, body, soul, and spirit, and
that in each of these throughout. 1 These. 5.23.
Every one that names himself from the name of Christ, ipso facto by the very
taking of that blessed name upon him, (...).
and daring to style himself Christian, virtually bind himself to depart from
all iniquity: 2 Timothy 2.19.
nor so only, but to endeavor also (after the example of him, whose name
otherwise he unworthily usurpeth,) to be just, merciful, temperate, humble,
meek, patient, charitable; the habits, and to exercise the acts, of these and
all other holy graces and virtues. Nay more; the Gospel imposes upon us some
moral strictness, which the Stoics themselves, or whoever else were the most
rigid Masters of morality, never so much as thought of. Nay yet more; it
exalts the Moral Law of God himself given by Moses to the people of Israel to
a higher pitch, then they (at least as they commonly understood the Law) took
themselves thereby obliged unto. That a man should forsake all his dearest
friends, yea and deny his own dearest self too, Luke 18.29. Mat. 16.24. Mat.
5.44. 1 John 3.16.
for Christ's sake; and yet for Christ's sake at the same time love his deadliest
enemies: That he should take up his Cross, and (if need lay down his life, not
only for his great master, but even for the meanest of his fellow servants too:
That he should exult with joy, and abound in hope, in the midst of
tribulations, of persecutions, of death it self! Surely the Mystery that
drives at all this, must needs be (...) in the highest degree: the great
mystery of godliness. That for the scope.

27. Look now secondly at the parts and parcels, the several pieces (as it
were) whereof this mystery is made up; those mentioned in this verse, and the
rest: and you shall find, that from each of them severally, but how much more
then from them altogether may be deduced sundry strong motives and perswasives
unto Godliness. Take the material parts of this Mystery: the Incarnation,
Nativity, Circumcision, Baptism, Temptation, Preaching, Life, Death, Burial,
Resurrection, Ascension, Intercession, and Second coming of Christ. Or take (if
I may so call them) the formal parts thereof: our eternal Election before the
world was, our Vocation by the preaching of the Gospel, our Justification by
Faith in the merits of Christ, our Sanctification by the Spirit of grace, the
steadfast promises we have, and hopes of future Glory, and the rest. It would be
too long to vouch texts for each particular; but golden chains, which does not
straightly tie up our hands, tongues, and hearts, from doing evil; draw us up
effectually unto God and Christ; and strongly oblige us to show forth the power
of his grace upon our souls, by expressing the power of Godliness in our lives
and conversations. That for the Parts.

28. Thirdly, Christian Religion may be called the mystery of Godliness, in
regard of its Conservation: because Godliness is the best preserver of
Christianity. Roots, and Fruits, and Herbs, which let alone and left to
themselves would soon corrupt and putrify; condited with sugar by a skilful
Confectioner, be preserved to continue for many years, and be serviceable all
the while. So the best and surest means to preserve Christianity in its proper
integrity and power, from corrupting into Atheism or Heresy, is to season it
well with Grace, (as we do fresh meats with salt to keep them sweet;) and to be
sure to keep the Conscience Holding the mysteries of Faith in a pure
Conscience, says our Apostle a little after, at ver. 9. of this Chapter: and
in the first Chapter of this Epistle ver. 19. Holding faith and a good
Conscience, which (later) some having put away, concerning faith have made
shipwreck. Apostasy from the faith springs most an end from Apostasy in
manners: And he that has but a very little care how he lives, can have no
very fast hold of what he believes. For when men grow once regardless of their
Consciences, good affections will soon languish: and then will noisome lusts
gather strength, and cast up mud into the soul, that the judgment cannot run
clear. Seldom is the head right, where the heart is amiss. A rotten heart will
be ever and anon sending up evil thoughts into the mind, as marish and fenny
grounds do foggy mists into the air, that both darken and corrupt it. As a
man's taste, when some malignant humor affects the organ, savoureth nothing
aright, but deemeth sweet things bitter, and sour things pleasant: So where
avarice, ambition, malice, voluptuousness, vainglory, sedition, or any other
dominering lust has made it self master of the heart: it will so blind and
corrupt the judgment, that it shall not be able to discern (at any certainty)
good from evil, or truth from falsehood. Wholesome therefore Peter's advice, Esaias
5.20. 2 Pet. 1.5.
to add unto Faith Virtue. Virtue will not only keep it in life, but at such a
height of vigor also, that it shall not easily either degenerate into Heresy,
or languish into Atheism.

29. We see now 3. Reasons, for which the doctrine of Christianity may be
called The mystery of Godliness: because it first exacteth Godliness; and
secondly exciteth unto Godliness; and is thirdly best preserved by Godliness.
From these premises, I shall desire (for our nearer instruction) to infer but
two things only: the one, for the trial of Doctrines; the other, for the
bettering of our lives. For the S. John would not have us over forward to
believe every spirit. Every spirit, 1 John 4.1.
does he say? Truly it is impossible we should; unles we should believe flat
contradictions. Whilst one Spirit says, It is; another spirit says It is
not: can a man believe the one, and not disbeleeve the other, if he hear both?
Believe not every spirit then, is as much (in S. John's meaning) as if he had
said, Be not too hasty to believe any spirit (especially where there appears
some just cause of suspicion) but try it first, whether it be a true spirit or
a false. Even as S. Paul bids us prove all things, that having so done, we
may hold fast what upon trial proves good, 1 These. 5.21.
and let the rest

30. Now holy Scripture is certainly that Lapis Lydius, that Test whereby this
trial is to be made. Ad legem and ad testimonium: when we have wrangled as long
as we can, Esaias 8.10.
hitherto we must come at last. But since all Sectaries pretend to Scripture;
Papists, Anabaptists, All; yea the Devil himself can vouch Text, to drive on a
Temptation: It were good therefore we knew, how to make right application of
Scripture, for the Trial of Doctrines, that we do not mistake a false one for a
true one. Many profitable Rules for this purpose our Apostle affords us in
sundry places. One very good one we may gather from the words immediately
before the Text, wherein the Church of God is said to be the pillar and ground
of truth. The collection thence is obvious, that it would very much conduce to
the guiding of our judgments aright, in the examining of men's doctrines
concerning either Faith or Manners, wherein the letter of Scripture is obscure,
or the meaning doubtful; to inform in credendis, what the received sense; and
in agendis, what the constant usage and practice, of the Church (especially in
the ancienter times) has been concerning those matters: and that to consider
what conformity the doctrines under trial hold with the principles, upon which
that their sense or practice in the premises was grounded. The Judgment and
Practice of the Church, ought to sway very much with every sober and wise man:
either of which whosoever neglects, or but slighteth (as too many do, upon a
very poor pretense, that the mystery of iniquity began to work betimes)
runs a great hazard of falling into many Errors and Absurdities. good
fortune, more then his forecast: and if he do; he may thank none but himself,
for neglecting so good a guide.

31. But this now-mentioned Rule, although it be of excellent use, if it be
rightly understood, and prudently applied, and therefore growing so nere the
Text, I could not wholly baulk it; without some notice taken of it: it being
not within the Text, I press it no farther; but come to another, that springs
out of the very Text it self. And it is this: a very good one too. viz. That
when we are to try the doctrines, we should duly examine them whether they
according unto Godliness, yea or no. Our Saviors direction for the discovery
of false Prophets Mat. 7. is to this very purpose; Mat. 7.16, 20.
Ex fructibus, Ye shall know them by their fruits. Means he it, trow you, of
the fruits of their lives in their outward conversation? Verily no: not only;
no, nor principally neither: perhaps not at all. For Falsehood is commonly set
off by hypocrisy: (...) in the next following verse here. Shows of sanctity
and purity, pretensions of Religion and Reformation; is the wool that the
wolf wrappeth about him, when he means to do most mischief with least
suspicion. The Old Serpent sure is never so silly, as to think his ministers
the ministers of darkness) should be able to draw in a considerable party into
their communion, should they appear in their dismal colors: therefore he
puts them into a new dress before he sends them abroad; distinguishing and
transforming them as if they were the ministers of righteousness and of the
light. 2 Cor. 11.13. -- 15.
Our Savior therefore cannot mean the fruits of their lives so much, (if at
all,) the fruits of their Doctrines: that is to say, the necessary consequents
of their Doctrines; such conclusions, as naturally and by good and evident
discourse do issue from their Doctrines. And so understood, it is a very useful
Rule; even in the Affirmative, (taking in other requisite conditions withal:)
but in the Negative, taken even alone and by it self, it holds infallibly. If
what is spoken seem to be according to godliness; it is the better to like
onward, and the more likely to be true: yet may it possibly be false for all
that, and therefore it will be needful to try it farther, and to make use of
other Criterians withal. But if what is spoken, upon examination appear to
have any repugnancy with Godliness, wholesome words. It can be no heavenly
Doctrine, that teaches men to be earthly, sensual, or Devilish: or that
tends to make men unjust in their dealings, uncharitable in their censures,
undutiful to their superiors; or any other way, superstitious, licentious, or
profane.

32. I note it, not without much rejoicing and gratulation to us of this
Church. There are, God knows, a foot in the Christian world Controversies
more then a good-many: Decads, Centuries, Chiliads of novel Tenants, brought in
this last age, (which were the ancient Church) by Sectaries of all sorts. Now
it is our great comfort (blessed be God for it) that the Doctrine established
in the Church of England (I mean the public Doctrine, for that is it we are to
hold us to, passing by private opinions;) I say the public Doctrine of our
Church is such, as is not justly chargeable with any impiety, contrarious to
any part of that duty we owe either to God or Man. Oh that our conversations
were as free from exception, as our Religion is! Oh that we were sufficiently
careful to preserve the honor and luster of the truth we profess by the
correspondency of our lives

33. And upon this point we dare boldly join issue, with our clamorous
adversaries on either hand, Papists I mean, and Disciplinarians. Who do both,
so loudly, (but unjustly) accuse us and our Religion: they, as carnal and
licencious; these, as Popish and superstitious. As Eliah once said to the
Baalites, that God that answers by fire, 1 King. 18.24.
let him be God: so may we say to either of both; and when we have said it, not
fear to put it to a fair trial; That Church, whose Doctrine, Confession, and
Worship is most according to Godliness, let that be the Church. As for our
Accusers, if there cursed position alone, wherein (notwithstanding their
disagreements otherwise) they both consent; That lawful Sovereigns may be by
their Subjects resisted, and Arms taken up against them, for the cause of
Religion: it Ungodliness, as no man, that either fears God or King as he
ought to do, can speak of, or think of without detestation: and is certainly
(if either St Peter or St Paul, those two great Apostles understood themselves)
a branch rather of that other great mystery (2 These. 2.) the mystery of
Iniquity, then of the great Mystery here in the Text, the Mystery of
Godliness. There is not that point in all Popery besides, (to my understanding)
that makes it savor so strongly of Antichrist; as this one dangerous and
desperate point of Iesuitism does. Wherein yet those men, that are ever bawling
against our Ceremonies and Service, as Antichristian, do so deeply and
wretchedly symbolize with them. The Lord be judge between them and us: whether
our Service, or their Doctrine, be the more Antichristian.

34. I have done with the former Inference, for the trial of Doctrines: there
is another yet behind, for the bettering of our Lives. For since Christianity
is a Mystery of Godliness: it concerns every Christian man, so to take the
mystery along with him, that he leave not Godliness behind. That is,
whatsoever becomes of doubtful controversies; to look well to his life, and to
make conscience of without all controversy is his duty. I know, Controversies
must be looked into: and it were well, if it were done by them (and by them
only) whose gifts and callings serve for it. For truths must be maintained,
errors must be refuted, and the mouths of gainsayers must be stopped. All this
must be done, it is true: but it is as true, when all this is done, still the
shortest cut to heaven is Faith and Godliness.

35. I know not how better to draw my Sermon toward a conclusion, then by
observing how the great Preacher concludes his, Eccles. last. After he had
taken a large and exact survey of all the under the Sun, and found nothing in
them but Vanity and vexation of Spirit: he tells us at length, that in
multitude of books and much reading, we may sooner meet with weariness, then
satisfaction. But says he, if you will hear the end of all, here it is; this
is the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God and keep his Commandments; for
this is the whole business of man, upon which all his care and employment in
this world should be spent. So I say we may puzzle our selves in the pursuit
of knowledge, dive into the mysteries of all Arts and Sciences, especially
ingulph our selves deep in the studies of those three highest professions of
Physic, Law, For Physic, search into the writings of Hippocrates, Galen and
the Methodists, of Avicen and the Empericks, of Paracelsus and the Chemists;
for Law, wrestle through the large bodies of both Laws Civil and Canon, with
the vast Tomes of Glosses, Repertories, Responses, and Commentaries thereon,
and take in the Reports and year-books of our Common Law to boot; for Divinity,
get through a course of Councils, Fathers, Schoolmen, Casuists, Expositors, of
all sorts and sects. When all is done, after much weariness to the flesh and
(in comparison thereof) little satisfaction to the mind (for the more knowledge
we gain by all this travel, the more we discern our own ignorance, and thereby
but increase our own sorrow:) the short of all is this; and when I have said
it, I have done, you shall evermore find, try it when you will, Temperance, the
best Physic;
Patience, the best Law; and
A good Conscience the best Divinity.
I have done. Now to God, etc.

PSALM 119.75. I know, O Lord, that thy judgments are right: and that thou of
very faithfulness have caused me to be troubled.


1. IN which words the holy Prophet in two several conclusions gives unto God
the glory of those two his great attributes, that shine forth with so much
luster in all the Works of his providence: his Justice and his Mercy. The glory
of his Justice in the former conclusion, I know O Lord that thy judgments are
right: the glory of his Mercy in the latter, And that thou of very faithfulness
have caused And to secure us the better of the truth of both conclusions,
because flesh and blood will be ready to stumble at both: We have his Scio
prefixed, expressly to the former only, but (the speech being copulative)
intended to both. I know O Lord that thy judgments are right: and I know also
that thou of very faithfulness have caused me to be troubled. Our order must
Conclusions first, as they lie in the Text; and after that to proceed to David's
knowledge of them, although that stand first in the order of the words. In the
former Conclusion we have to consider of two things. First, what these
judgments of God are that David here speaks of, as the subject: and then of
the righteousness thereof, as the Predicate. I know, O Lord, that thy judgments
are right.

2. What Judgments first? There are judicia oris, and there are judicia
operis: the judgments of Gods mouth, and the judgments of Gods hands. Of the
former there is mention at Verse. 13. With my lips have I been telling of all
the judgments of thy mouth] And by these Judgments are meant nothing else but
the holy Law of God, and his whole written word; which every where in this
Psalm are indifferently called his Statutes, his Commandments, his Precepts,
his Testimonies, his Judgments. And the Laws of God are therefore (amongst
other reasons) called by the name of (...). Justin Martyr. respons. ad orthod.
qu. 92.
Judgments; because by them we come to have a right judgment, whereby to
discern between good and evil. We could not otherwise with any certainty judge,
what was meet for us to do, and what was needful for us to shun. A lege tua
intellexi, at verse 104. By thy St Paul confesses Romans 7. that he had never
rightly known what sin was, if it had not been for the Law: and he instanceth
in that of lust, which he had not known to be a sin, Romans 7.7.
if the Law had not said Thou shall not covet. And no question but these
judgments, these judicia oris, are all right too: for it were unreasonable to
think, that God should make that a rule of right to us; which were it self not
right. We have both the name, (that of judgments;) and the thing too, (that
they are right) in the 19th Psalm: Where having highly commended the Law of
God, under the several appellations of Law, Testimonies, Statutes, and
Commandments Judgments verse 9 The judgments of the Lord are true and
righteous altogether.

3. Besides these Iudicia Oris, which are Gods judgments of direction: there
are also Iudicia Operis, which are his judgments for correction. And these do
ever include aliquid poenale, something inflicted upon us by Almighty God, as
it were by way of punishment; something that breeds us trouble or grief: The
Apostle says Heb. 12. that every chastening is grievous: Heb. 12.11.
and so it is more or less; or else it could be to us no punishment. And these
again are of two sorts: yet not distinguished so much by the things themselves
the condition of the persons on whom they are inflicted, and especially by the
affection, and intention of God that inflicteth them. For all, whether public
calamities that light upon whole Nations, Cities, or other greater or lesser
societies pestilences, famine, war, inundations, unseasonable weather, and the
like;) or private afflictions that light upon particular families or persons,
(as sickness, poverty, disgraces, injuries, death of friends, and the like: All
these, and whatsoever other of either kind, may undergo a twofold
consideration: in either of both which, they may not unfitly be termed the
Judgments of God; though in different respects.

4. For either these things are sent by Almighty God in his heavy displeasure,
as plagues upon his enemies, intending therein their destruction. Such as were
those public judgments, upon the old world, swept away with the flood; upon
Sodom and the other fire from heaven; upon Pharaoh and his host, overwhelmed in
the red Sea; upon the Canaanites, spewed out of the land for their
abominations; upon Jerusalem, at the final destruction thereof by the Romans.
And those private judgments also, that befell sundry particular persons, as
Cain, Absolon, Senacherib, Herod, and others. Or else they are laid by Amighty
God as gentle corrections upon his own children, in his fatherly love toward
them, and for their good; to chastise them for their strayings, to bring them
to repentance for their sins, to make them more observant and careful their
duty thence-forward, to exercise their faith and patience and other graces, and
the like. Such as were those distresses that befell the whole people of Israel
sundry times under Moses, and in the days of their Judges and Kings; and those
particular trials and afflictions, wherewith Abraham, and Joseph, and Job, and
David, and Paul, and other the holy Saints and servants of God were exercised
in their times.

5. Both the one sort and the other are called Judgments: but (as I said) in
different respects, and for different reasons. Those former plagues are called
Gods Judgments; because they come from father, but as a just and severe Judge:
who proceeding according to course of Law gives sentence against a malefactor
to cut him off. And therefore this kind of judgment David earnestly
deprecateth, Psalm 143. [ Enter not into judgment with thy servant:] for then
neither can I, Psalm. 143.2.
nor any flesh living be justified in thy sight. These later corrections also
or chastenings of our heavenly father are called Judgments too, 1 Cor. 11.32.
[ When we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord:] but in a quite different
notion. Because God proceeds therein, not with violence and fury, as men that
are in passion use to do: but coolely, and advisedly, and with judgment. And
therefore, whereas David deprecated Gods judgment (as we heard) in that former
notion, and as Judgment is opposed to Favor: Jeremy on the other side desires
Gods Judgment in this later notion, and as it is opposed to Fury [Correct me* O
Lord: Jer. 10.24.
yet in thy judgment, not in thy fury.] Jer. 10.

6. Now we see the several sorts of Gods Judgments: which the Conclusion would
hold them, and hold true too. Iudicia oris, and judicia operis; public and
private judgments; those plagues wherewith in fury he punishes his enemies,
and those rods wherewith in mercy he corrects his children: most certain it
is, they are all right. But yet I conceive those judicia oris not to be so
properly meant in this place: for the Exegesis in the later part of the verse,
(wherein what are here called judgments, are there expounded by troubles)
seems to exclude them, and to confine the Text in the proper intent thereof
to these judicia operis only: but public or private, plagues or corrections.
Of all which he pronounces that they are Right: which is the predicate of the
Conclusion; and comes next to be considered. I know, O Lord, that thy
judgments are right.

7. And we may know it too, if we will but care to know either God or Our
selves. First for God; though we be not -- incomprehensibilis dispositio, and
irreprehensibilis. Bernard. sermon. 103.
able to comprehend the reasons of his dispensations, the (...): yet for (...),
that the judgments are right, it may satisfy us if we do but know that they
are his. Tua will infer recta strongly enough: for the Lord, who is righteous
in all his ways, must needs be so in the way of his judgments too. Psalm.
145.17. Esaias 26.8.
1. Men's judgments are sometimes not right mis-informations, and sundry other
mistakings and defects; for which the Laws therefore allow writs of Error,
appeals, and other remedies: But as for God, he not only spieth out the goings,
but also searches into the hearts of all men; Psalm. 139.3.
he pondereth their spirits, Prove. 21.2.
and by him all their actions are weighed. 2. Men's judgments are sometimes not
right, because themselves are partial and unjust; awed with fear, blinded with
gifts, transported with passion, carried away with favor or disaffection, or
wearied with importunity. But as for God, with him is no respect of persons,
nor possibility of being corrupted. Romans 2.11.
Abraham took that for granted, the judge of all the world must needs do right,
Genesis 18.25.
Genesis 18. And the Apostle rejects all suspicion to the contrary with an
Absit, (what shall we say then? is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid,
Romans 9. Romans 9.14.
) 3. Men's judgments are sometimes not right, merely for want of zeal to
justice: They lay not the causes of poor men to heart, nor are willing to put
themselves to the pains or trouble of sifting a cause to the bottom, nor care
much which way it go, so as they may but be at rest, and enjoy their ease. But
as for God, he is zealous of doing justice: he loves it himself; he requires
it in others; punishing the neglect of it, and rewarding the administration of
it in them to whom it The righteous Lord loves righteousness, Psalm. 11.)

Psalm. 11. ult.
8. And then secondly in our selves we may find (if we will but look) enough to
satisfy us even for the (...) too, so far as is meet for us to expect
satisfaction. The judgments of God indeed are abyssus multa: his ways are in
the sea, and his paths in the deep waters, Psalm. 77.19.
and his footstops are not known; (...): (...). Romans 11.33.
Soon may we lose our selves in the search, but never find them out. Yet even
there, where the judgments of God are like a great deep, unfathomable by any
finite understanding: his righteousness yet stands like the high mountains
(as it is in Psalm 36.) visible to every eye. Psalm. 36.6.
If any of us shall search well into his own heart, and weigh his own carriage
and deservings: if he shall not then find enough in himself to justify God in
all his proceedings; I forbid him not to say (which yet I tremble but to
rehearse) that God is unrighteous.

9. The holy Saints of God therefore have ever acquitted him, condemning
themselves. The Prophet Jeremy in the behalf of himself and the whole Church of
God, [ The Lord is righteous: Lam. 1.18.
for I have rebelled against his Commandment, Lam. 1.) So did Daniel in that
his solemn confession, when he set his face to seek the Lord God by prayer and
supplications, with fasting and sackcloth and ashes Dan. 9. ( O Lord,
righteousness belongs unto thee; but unto us confusion of face, as it is
this day, to our Kings, to our Princes, and to our fathers: because we have
sinned against thee, verse 7.) and again after at verse 14. ( Therefore has
the Lord watched upon the evil, and brought it upon us; for the Lord our God is
righteous in all his works which Yea so illustrious many times is the
righteousness of God in his judicial proceedings, that it has extorted an
acknowledgment from men obstinately wicked. Pharaoh, who sometimes in the pride
of his heart had said, Who is the Lord? was afterward by the evidence of the
fact it self forced to this confession, Exodus 5.2.
I have sinned: the Lord is righteous, but I and my people are wicked, Exodus 9.
Exodus 9.27.


10. They are then (at least in that respect) worse then wicked Pharaoh, that
to justify themselves, will not stick to repine even at God himself, and his
judgments; as if he were cruel, and they unrighteous: slothful servant in the
parable, that did his master no service at all; and yet as lazy as he was, Mat.
25.24.
could blame his master for being an hard man. Cain, when he had slain his
righteous brother, and God had laid a judgment upon him for it; complained of
the burden of it, as if the Lord had dealt hardly with him, in laying more upon
him then he was able to bear: Genesis 4.13.
never considering the weight of the sin, which God in justice could not bear.
Solomon notes it as a fault common among men, when by their own sinful folly
they have pulled misery upon themselves, then to murmur against God, and
complain of his providence: Prove. 19.3.
[ The folly of a man perverteth Prove. 19.] As the Israelites in their passage
through the wilderness, were ever and anon murmuring and complaining at
somewhat or other; either against God, or (which comes much to one) against
Moses and Aaron, and that upon every occasion, and for every trifle: so do we.
Every small disgrace, injury, affront, or loss, that happens betters, the
unkindness of our neighbors, the undutifulness of our children, the
unfaithfulness of our servants, the unsuccesfulness of our attempts, or by any
other means whatsoever; any sorry thing, will serve to put us quite out of
patience: Jonas 4.8.
as Jonas took pet at the withering of the gourd. And as he was ready to
justify his impatience even to God himself [ Do thou well to be angry, --
Verse 9.
Jonas? Ey marry do I; I do well to be angry even to the death:] so are we
ready, in all our murmurings against the Lords corrections, to flatter our
selves as if we did not complain without cause; especially where we are able to
charge unrighteous dealing.

11. This is, I confess, a strong temptation to flesh and blood; and many of
Gods holy servants have had much ado to overcome it, whilst they looked a
little too much outward. But yet we have by the help of God a very present
remedy there-against, if blind self-love will but suffer us to be so wise as
to make use of it: and that is no more but this, to turn our eye inward; and to
examine our selves, not how well we have dealt with other men who now requite
us so ill; but how we our selves have requited God, who has dealt so
graciously and bountifully with us. If we thus look back into our selves sins,
we shall soon perceive that God is -- Etsi proximus exigere forsi^an non possit
ex jure, exigit tame^ Deus. Bernard. sermon. de verb. Origenis.
just even in those things wherein men are unjust; and that we have most
righteously deserved at his hands to suffer all those things, which yet we have
no ways deserved at their hands by whom we suffer. It will well become us
therefore, whatsoever judgments God shall please at any time to lay upon us, or
to threaten us withal, either public or private, either by his own immediate
hand, or by such instruments as he shall employ; Phil. 2.14.
without all murmurings or disputings to submit to his good will and pleasure,
and to accept the punishment of our iniquity, (as the phrase is Levit. 26.) by
humbling our selves, Levit. 26.41, 43.
and confessing the Lord is righteous: as Rehoboam and the Princes of Judah did
2 Chronicles. 12. The sense of our own wickedness in rebelling, and the
acknowledgment of Gods justice in punishing, 2 Chronicles. 12.6.
(which are the very first acts of true humiliation, and the first steps unto
true repentance;) we shall find by the mercy of God to be of great efficacy,
not only for the averting of Gods judgments after they are come, but also (if
used timely enough and thoroughly enough) for the preventing thereof before they
be come. 1 Cor. 11.31.
For if we would judge our selves, we should not be judged of the Lord, 1 Cor.
11. But because we neglect it, (and yet it is a thing that must be done, or we
are undone;) God -- 32.
even as it there follows, When we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord,
that we should not be condemned with the world. And this is that faithfulness
of God which David acknowledges in the later Conclusion: whereunto I now pass.

12. -- And that thou of very faithfulness have caused me to be In which words
we have these three points: First, David was troubled: next God caused him to
be so troubled: last, and God did so out of very faithfulness. No great news,
when we hear of David, to hear of troubles withal; ( Lord, Psalm. 132.1.
remember David and all his troubles, Psalm. 132.) Consider him which way you
will, in his condition natural, spiritual, or civil; that is, either as a man,
or as a godly man, or as a King: and he had his portion of troubles in every of
those conditions. First, troubles he must have as a man. Haec est conditio
nascendi. Every mothers child that comes into the world, -- (...). Pythag.
aur. carm.
falls a childs-part of those troubles the world affords. Man those few
days that he has to live he shall be sure to have them full of trouble
howsoever. In mundo pressuram, says our Savior, In the world ye shall have
tribulation. Never think it can be otherwise, Job 14.1. Joh. 16.33. Psalm. 84.6.
Eccl. 1.14.
so long as you live here below in the vale of misery, where at every turn you
shall meet with nothing but very vanity and vexation of spirit.

13. Then he was a Godly man: and his troubles were somewhat the more for that
too. 2. Tim. 3.12.
For all that will live godly must suffer persecution: and however it is with
other men, certainly many are the troubles of the righteous. Psalm. 34.19.
It is the common lot of the true children of outflyings, Heb. 12.7, 8.
wherewith their holy Father is not well-pleased, to come under the scourge
oftener then the bastards do. If they do amiss, (and amiss they do) they must
smart for it either here, or hereafter: 1. Cor. 11.32.
Now God means them no condemnation hereafter, and therefore he gives them
the more chastening here.

14. But was not David a King? and would not that exempt him from troubles? He
was so indeed: but I ween his troubles were neither the fewer nor the lesser
for that. There are sundry passages in this Psalm, that induce me to believe
(with great probability) David made it while he lived a young man in the Court
of Saul, Verse. 9.99, 100, etc.
long before his coming to the Crown. But yet he was even then unctus in Regem,
anointed and designed for the Kingdom; and he met even then with many troubles
the more for that very respect. And after he came to enjoy the Crown, if God
had not been the joy and crown of his heart, he should have had little joy of
it: so full of trouble and unrest was the greatest part of his reign. I note
it, not with a purpose to enter into a set discourse how many and great the
troubles are that attend the Crowns and Scepters of Princes; which I easily
believe to be far both more and greater, then we that stand two other reasons a
great deal more useful, and therefore so much the more needful to be thought on
both by them and us. It should first work in all them that sit aloft, and so
are exposed to more and stronger blasts, the greater care to provide a safe
resting place for their souls: that whenever they shall meet with trouble and
sorrow in the flesh, (and that they (Return unto thy rest, O my soul.) It was
well for him, Psalm. 116 7.
that he had such a rest for his soul: for he had rest little enough otherwise,
from continual troubles and cares in his civil affairs and estate. And it
should in all reason secondly quicken the hearts of all loyal and well-affected
subjects, by their prayers, counsels, services, aids, and cheerful obedience
respectively, rather to afford Princes their best assistance, for the
comfortable support of that their weighty and troublesome charge; then out of
ambition, or any other cross or peevish humor add unto their cares, and create
unto them more troubles.

15. David, you see, had troubles; as a man, as a godly man, as a King. But who
caused them? Sure in those his first times, when (as I conjecture) he wrote
this Psalm; Saul with his Princes and followers was the chiefest cause of most
of his troubles: and afterward crafty Ahitophel caused him much trouble, and
railing Shimei some, and seditious Sheba not a little; but his rebellious son
Absalon most of all. He complains of many troublers raised by the means of
that son, in Psalm 3. Domine quam multiplicati! Lord how are they increased
that trouble me. Psalm. 3.1.
Yet here, you see; he overlooketh them all, second causes; and ascribes his
troubles wholly unto God. So he did also afterward in the particular of
Shimei's railing; Let him alone, 2 Samuel 16.10.
says he to Abishai, Let him curse on, for God has bidden him. Even as Job
had done before him: when the Sabeans and the Chaldeans had taken away his
cattle and goods, he scarce took notice of them, (he knew they were but
instruments;) but looked at the hand of God only, as the chief and principal
cause, Dominus abstulit, Job 1.21.
The Lord has given, and the Lord has taken away. Neither did David any
injury at all to Almighty God in ascribing it to him: for God also himself
takes it all upon himself; I will raise him evil 2 Samuel 12.11, 12.
and I will do it before the sun, 2 Samuel 12.

16. How all those things, (wherein wicked men serving their own lusts only in
their own purpose, Eckz. 29.20; Esaias 10.5. -- 15.
do yet unwittingly do service to God Almighty in furthering his wise and holy
designs) can have their efficiency from causes of such contrary quality, and
looking at such contrary ends, to the producing of one and the same effect: is
a speculation more curious then profitable. It is enough for us to know, that
it neither casts any blemish at all upon him, that he makes such use of
them; nor gives any excuse at all to them, that they do such service to him:
but that all this notwithstanding, he whole glory of his own wisdom and
holiness; and they shall still bear the whole burden of their own folly and
wickedness. But there is another, and that a far better use to be made hereof,
then to trouble our selves about a mystery that we shall never be all the
troubles that befall us in any kind whatsoever, or by what instruments soever,
come yet from the hand of God; we should not therefore, when at any time we
meet with trouble, rage against the second causes, or seek to venge our teen
upon them, as of our selves we are very apt to do: but laying our hands upon
our mouths, compose our selves to a holy patience and silence; considering it
is Placeat homini, quicquid Deo placuit. Senec. Epist. 75.
his will and pleasure to have it so, to whom it is both our duty and wisdom
wholly to submit.

17. We may learn it of holy Job. His wife moved his patience Job 2.10.
Thou talkest like a foolish woman, says he: shall we receive good things at
the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil also? Or we may learn it of good
old Eli. When he received a message from the Lord by the mouth of young Samuel
of a right heavy judgment shortly to fall upon him and his house for his fond
indulgence to his ungracious children; he made no more reply, but said only, It
is the Lord: let him do what seems him good. Or, to go no further then our
Prophet David, 1 Samuel 3.18.
we may learn it sufficiently from him, Psalm 39. I was dumb, says he, Psalm.
39.9.
and opened not my mouth, Quoniam tu fecisti, for it was thy doing. This
consideration alone, Quoniam tu fecisti, is enough to silence all causes us to
be troubled. All whose judgments, are not only done in righteousness, as we
have hitherto heard: but toward his children also out of much love and
faithfulness, as we are next to hear, [ I know that of very faithfulness thou
have caused me to be troubled.]

18. In the former part of the verse, where he spoke of the righteousness of
God, he did it indefinitely, without mentioning either himself or any other
person: not particularly, Thy judgments but indefinitely, I know O Lord, that
thy judgments are right. But now in this latter part of the verse, where he
comes to speak of the faithfulness of God, he names himself; And that thou of
very faithfulness have caused Me to be troubled. For as earthly Princes must
do justice to all men, (for Justice is (...), every man may challenge it, and
there must be no respect had, no difference made of persons therein;) but their
favors they may bestow upon whom they think good: so God will have his justice
to appear in all his dealings with all men generally, be they good or bad, that
none of them all shall be able to say he has done them tender mercies and
loving kindnesses, those he reserveth for the godly only, who are in special
favor with him, and toward whom he bears a special respect. For by
faithfulness here, as in sundry other places of Scripture, is meant nothing
else but the special love and favor of God toward those that love and fear
him, whereby he orders and disposes all things so,

19. And it is not unfitly so called; whether we respect the gracious promises,
that God has made unto them, or those sundry mutual relations, that are
between him and them. First, faithfulness relates to a promise: Heb. 10.23.
( He is faithful that has promised Heb. 10.) Truly God is a debtor to no man:
that he does for us any thing at all, it is ex mero motu, of his own grace and
goodness merely; we can challenge nothing at his hands. But yet so desirous is
he to manifest his gracious love to us, that he has freely bound himself, and
so made himself a voluntary debtor by his promises, (for promise is) insomuch
as he gives us the leave, and allows us the boldness to remind him of his
promises, to urge him with them, and as it were to adjure him by all his truth
and faithfulness to make them good. But what a kind of promise is this, may
some say; to promise a man to trouble him? It seems a threatening this: not a
promise. If these be his promises, God may keep his promises to himself; we
shall not be very forward to challenge him or his faithfulness about them. Yet
so it is: the afflictions and troubles wherewith God in his love chasteneth his
children for their good, are indeed part of his promise, and that a gracious
part too. In Mark persecutions, (and persecutions are troubles) expressly named
there among other things, as a part of the promise or reward; Mark 10.30.
( No man that has left house or brethren etc. for my sake and the Gospels,
but he shall receive an hundred fold now in this time, houses, and brethren,
etc. with persecutions, and in the world to come eternal life.) There it is
expressed: but where it is not so, it must ever be understood in all the promises
that concern this life. It is a received rule among Divines, that all temporal
promises are to be understood cum exceptione crucis: that is to say, not
absolutely, but with this reservation, unless the Lord in his holy wisdom shall
see it good for us to have it otherwise. So that if at any time he see it good
for us troubled, (as many times he does; David confesses it but four verses
higher, Psalm. 119.71.
Bonum mihi quod humiliasti, It is good for me that I have been in trouble;) he
does then in great love to us cause us to be troubled: and that out of very
faithfulness, and in regard of his Promise.

20. There are also sundry mutual relations, wherein God and his people stand
tied either to other; all which require faithfulness. He is their Creator, 1
Pet. 4.19.
and they are the work of his hands: and St Peter styles him a faithful
Creator. He is their shepherd, and they the Psalm. 23.1.
and a faithful shepherd he is, a good shepherd, John 10. To omit these, and
sundry other, as of Father, Master, Husband, John 10.11.
and the rest: take but this one relation only of friendship; whereto (as every
man knows) faithfulness is so necessary, as nothing can be more. Now as for
those that believe God and keep his Commandments, God enters into a league
and covenant of Inter bonos viros and Deum amicitia est, conciliante virtute.
Senec. de Provid. cap. 1.
friendship with them: for Faith and Obedience are those very things that
qualify us for his friendship. ( Abraham believed God, and it was counted to
him for righteousness, and he was called the friend of God, James 2.) There is
Faith. Ye are my friends, if ye keep my commandments, says our Savior, John
15. There is Obedience. Such a league of friendship there was betwixt God and
David in his particular: and as strongly tied and confirmed, James 2.23. John
15.14.
as any other we read of; the parties swearing fidelity either to other. God to
him: The Lord has made a faithful Oath unto David, Psalm. 32.11.
and he shall not shrink from it. And he to God: I have sworn, and am
steadfastly purposed, The misery is; Psalm 119.106.
we hold not touch perfectly with God, but break with him oftentimes through
humane frailty and subreption, and sometimes also in a more desperate and
provoking manner, when we sin presumptuously and with a high hand. David
himself, notwithstanding his Oath, and the stedfastness of his purpose to
perform it, yet held not out; but failed sundry times through infirmity: but he
shrank most shamefully and foully in the matter of Vriah. But here is our
comfort then on the other side; that though we are wavering and loose, off and
on, 3 King. 15.5.
and no hold to be taken of us; yet he is still the same, he remains friend
to us. Though we sometimes so far forget our selves and our faithful promise,
as to deny him; yet he continues faithful, and will not deny himself: no nor
us neither, 2 Timothy 2.13.
if we will but seek to him in any time by true repentance, confessing our
unfaithfulness and asking pardon thereof, and not wholly and finally renounce
the covenant we made with him. It makes well for us, that he is not forward to
take (no not all just) exceptions he might: if he should be any whit extreme,
to mark what we do amiss, Psalm 130.3.
not a man of us all should long abide in his friendship. It is not our
faithfulness then to him, but his faithfulness to us, that holds us in.

friendly part: will any friend cause his friend to be troubled; especially
having the power in himself to prevent it? As Absolon said to Hushai, Is this
thy kindness to thy friend? Call you this faithfulness? Yes indeed: 2 Samuel
16.17.
and very faithfulness too. For a true friend aims at his friends Id pactum
est ab illo mundi conditore,

-- ut salvi essemus, non delicati. Senec. epist. 119.


good in every thing he does; and in comparison of that, regards not at any
time the satisfying of any his inordinate or unreasonable desires. And
therefore he will freely reprove him when he sees him to do otherwise then
well: and sometimes anger him by doing some things quite contrary to his mind,
but yet for his good. Yea, and if the inequality and condition of the persons
be such as will bear it, he will give him also such punishment or other
correction, as shall be needful according to the merit of his fault. And all
this he may do salva amicitia, and without breach of friendship: nay, he is so
far tied by the rules of true friendship to do all this, and out of -- Ego
amicum hodie meum concastigabo -- Invitus, in (...) id invitet ut faciam fides.
Plant. in Trinumm 1.1.
very faithfulness, that he should rules, and prove unfaithful, if he should
neglect so to do, where the cause requires it. Does not a father scourge the
son in whom he delights? and sometimes give him sharp correction, when the
fault deserves it? And no friend can love his friend more dearly and
faithfully, then a father does his child. Nay this chastening is so far from
being any argument of the fathers dis-affection; that it is rather one of the
strongest evidences of his faithful love toward him: Prove. 3.12.
and he should not love him faithfully but foolishly, if he should out of fond
indulgence let him go on in an evil way without due correction. Prove. 13.24.
He that spares the rod hates his child, says Solomon: interpretative; that
is, he does his child as much hurt out of his fond love, as he could not do
him more harm, if he were his enemies child whom he hates. Will not a mother,
that loves her child with all tenderness, if it have got some hurt with a
fall, lay on a plaster to heal it, though it smart? and though the child cry
and struggle against it all it can, yet will she lay it on for all that, ey
and bind it too to keep it on: and all out of very love and faithfulness,
because she knows it must be so, or the child will be the worse for it. I
use these comparisons the rather, not only because they are familiar, (and the
more familiar ever the better if Psalm. 103.13.
by the love of a discreet father, and the affection of a tender mother, Esaias
49.15.
toward the fruit of their own loins and womb: And the Apostle at large
prosecuteth the resemblance, (and that in this very matter whereof we now
speak, of our heavenly Fathers correcting his children in love and for their
good) most accurately and comfortably in Heb. 12.

22. But to return back to the relation of friendship (from which yet I have
not disgressed: for can we have any better friends then our parents?) If any of
us have a friend that is lethargique or lunatique: will we not put the one from
his drousie seat, and shake tie the other in his bed, hamper him with cords, ey
and with blows too if need be, to keep him quiet? though it be death to the one
to be stirred, and to the other to be tied. Or if we have some near friend or
kinsman, that we wish well to, and partly depends upon us for his livelihood,
that will not be advised by us, but will flee out into bad company, drink, and
quarrel, and game: will we not pinch him in his allowance; refuse to give him
entertainment; set some underhand to beat him when he quarrels in his drink,
or cheat him when he gameth too deep; and if he will not be reclaimed
otherwise, get him arrested and laid up, and then let him lie by it, till shame
and want give him some better sight and sense of his former follies? Can any
man now charge us truly with unfaithfulness to our friend for so doing? Or is
it not rather a good proof love and faithfulness to him? Doubtless it is. You
know the old saying, Non quod odio habeam, sed quod amem: it has some reason
in it. For the love and faithfulness of a friend is not to be measured by the
things done, but by the affection and intention of the doer. A thing may be
done, that carries the show of much friendship with it, yet with an intent to
do the party a mischief: Eutrapelus cuicunque nocere volebat -- etc. Hort. 1.
Epist. 18.
As if he should put his friend upon some employment he were unmeet for, of
purpose to disgrace him; or feed him with money in his estate: 1 Samuel 18.21.
like Saul's friendship to David in giving him his daughter to wife, that she
might be a snare to him to put him into the hands of the Philistines. This is
the basest unfaithfulness of all other sub amici fallere nomen; and by many
degrees worse then open hostility. Psalm. 141.5.
Let not their precious balmes break my head: Let the righteous rather smite me
friendly, says David: There may be smiting, it should seem by him, without
violation of friendship. And his wise son Solomon prefers the wounds of a
friend, before the kisses of an enemy. These may be pleasanter, Prove. 27.6.
but those will wholsomer: there is treachery in these kisses, but in those
wounds faithfulness.

23. You may perceive by what has been said, that God may cause his servants
to be troubled, and yet continue his love and faithfulness to them
nevertheless: yea moreover that he brings those troubles upon them out of his
great love and faithfulness toward them. It should make us the more willing,
whether God inflict or threaten, whether we feel or fear, any either public
calamity or personal affliction, any thing that is like to breed us any grief
or trouble; to submit our selves to the hand of God, not only with patience,
because he is righteous, but even with thankfulness too, because he is faithful
therein. Very meet we should apprehend the wrath of God and his just
indignation against us when he strikes; for he is righteous, and will not
correct us but for our sin: Which should prick our hearts with sorrow, Acts
2.37. Joel 2.13.
nay rend them in pieces with through-contrition, that we should so unworthily
provoke so gracious a God to punish us. But then we must so apprehend his
wrath, that we doubt not of his favor, nor despair of staying his hand, if we
will but stay the course of our sins by godly repentance and reformation: for
he is faithful, and corrects us ever for our good. Heb. 12.10.
Does he take sworn the contrary; and dare you not believe him? Doubt ye not
therefore, Ezekiel. 33.11.
but that humility and confidence, fear and hope, may consist together: as well
as justice and mercy may in God, or repentance and faith in us. Presume not
then to continue in sin, but fear his judgments: for he is righteous, and will
not acquit the guilty. Exodus 34.7.
Neither yet despair of finding pardon, but hope in his mercy: for he is
faithful, and will the penitent. Psalm. 51.17.
I forbid no man, but charge him rather, as he means to build his
after-comforts upon a firm base, to lay a good foundation of repentance and
godly sorrow, by looking first upon Gods justice and his own sins: that he may
be cast down, and humbled under the mighty hand of God, before he presume to
lay hold of any actual mercy. 1 Pet. 5.6.
But after he has by this means assured the foundation; let him then in Gods
name proceed with his work, and bring it on more and more to perfection, by
sweet meditations of the great love and gracious promises of our good God, and
his undoubted stedfastness and faithfulness therein. Never giving it over, love
even in the very wrath of God; Mel de petra, suck honey out of the stony rock;
Deus quos amat, indurat, recognoscit, exercet. Senec. de provid. cap. 4.
gather grapes of thorns, and figs of thistles. Till we attain to this; I say
not but we may have true hope, and comfort in God, which by his mercy may bring
us to salvation: but we have not yet that fullness of joy and peace, which
(because of Gods grace, if our own endeavors be not wanting, it is attainable
in this life) we should press hard after; of rejoicing in tribulation, and
counting it all joy, Romans 5.3. James 1.2.
when we fall into diverse temptations.

24. Somewhat a hard lesson I grant: yet if we can but learn David's knowledge,
it will be much the easier. He speaks not here you see, out of a vain hope,
because he would fain have it so; nor out of some uncertain conjecture, as if
perhaps it might be so: but out of certain knowledge, gotten by diligent and
attentive study in the word of God, and by his own experience and observation.
I know O Lord, that thy judgments are right, and that thou of very faithfulness
have caused me to be troubled. For the former branch of this knowledge, that
concerns the righteousness of Gods judgments; it is a thing soon learned: I
have showed you the course already. There is no more to be done, but to examine
our own carriage and deserving; know that it is done out of very love and
faithfulness, whenever God causes us to be troubled.

25. For which purpose the best help I can commend unto you for the present is,
to observe how variously Almighty God manifests his love and faithfulness to
his children in all their tribulations: especially in three respects; every one
of which marvellously sets forth his gracious goodness toward us. First,
the End that secondly, the Proportion that he holds in them: and thirdly, the
Issues that he gives out of them.

26. For the End first; He aims always at our good. Our earthly friends do
not ever so: no not our Parents, that love us best. The Apostle tells us, and
experience proves it, that they chasten for their own pleasure. He means,
that sometimes when they are distempered with passion, Heb. 12.10.
and in an outrageous mood, they beat the poor child, either without cause, or
more then there is cause, rather to satisfy their own fury, then to benefit
the child. But he does it always (...). Nazianz. Orat. 3.
for our profit, says he, Heb. 12. If I should enter here into the
Commonplace de bono afflictionis, I should not well know either where to
begin, or when to make an end. In the whole course of Divinity, I find not a
field of larger scope then that is. I shall therefore bring you but into one
corner of it, and show you, how God out of very faithfulness makes use of
these troubles, for the better draining out of some of corruptions, that would
otherwise so abound in us, like noisome humors in the body, that they would
endanger a plethory in our souls: especially these four, Pride, security,
worldly-mindednesse, and In-compassion.

27. Pride must be first, else is it not right. And we have store of that in
us. Any toy puffs us up like a bladder, and fills us full of our selves.
Take the instance but in our knowledge: A sorry thing, God knows: he that has
most, what he knows is not the thousandth part of what he knows not: and
yet how strangely are overleavened with a very small pittance of it? Scientia
inflat, 1 Cor. 8.1.
the Apostle might well say; knowledge puffs up. So does riches, and honor,
and praise, and valor, and beauty, and wit; or indeed any thing. A bush of
hair will do it, where it grows; ey and where it grows not. Now prosperity
cherishes this corruption wonderfully, (as ill humors abound most in full
bodies; and ill weeds grow rankest in a fat earth;) and sets a man so far
from God, and above himself, that he neither well knows the one, nor the
other. Our Lord then, when he sees us thus high set, sends afflictions and
troubles, to take down these unkindly swellings, to prick the pride, and let
out some of the wind: and so he brings us into some -- adversisque in rebus
noscere qui sint. Lucret. lib. 3.
better acquaintance with our selves again. King Philip had a crier to put him
daily in remembrance, that he was but a man: lest he should forget it, and
think himself a little God, as his son Alexander did soon after. But there is
no remembrancer can do this office better then afflictions can. Put them in
fear O Lord, that the heathen may know themselves to be but men, Psalm. 9. Psalm.
9.20.
If afflictions were not; would not even that be soon forgotten?

28. Security is next. Ease and prosperity fatteneth the heart, and makes us
drousie and heavy in Gods service. It casts us Lethargy; makes us settle
upon our lees, Jer. 48.11.
and flatter our selves, as if we were out of gunshot, and no evil could reach
us. Soul take thine ease; eat, and drink; Luke 12.19.
thou have provision laid up beforehand for many years yet to come. Marvel not
to hear ungodly men vaunt it so in a vapouring manner, ( Psalm 10. Psalm. 10.6.
Tash I shall never be removed, there shall no harm happen unto me:) when holy
David upon some little longer continuance of prosperity then usual, Psalm. 30.6.
he thought his hill so strong, that he should never be removed, Psalm 30. When
God sees us thus settling upon our lees, Jer. 48.11.
he thinks it high time to pour us from vessel to vessel, to keep us from
growing musty. He lays his hand upon us, and shakes us out of our dead
sleep, Psalm. 66.11.
and by laying trouble upon our loins drives us to seek to him for remedy and
succor. He dealt so with David: when in his prosperity he had said, he should
never be removed, as we heard but now out of Psalm 30. the next news we hear of
him is, He was removed: God, out of very faithfulness caused him to be
troubled, Psalm. 30.7. -- 8.
and he was the better for it. ( Thou did turn away as it there follows in
that Psalm. Psalm. 77.2.
) In the time of my trouble I sought the Lord, says he elsewhere: Belike in the
time of his ease, he either sought him not, or not so carefully. In their
afflictions they will seek me diligently, Hosea 5. but negligently enough out
of affliction. Hos. 5.15.
Absolon had a mind to speak with Ioab, 2 Samuel 14 29. -- 31.
but Ioab had no mind to speak with him. Absolon sends for him, one messenger
after another: still Ioab comes not. Well, thinks Absolon, he will not come,
but I will fetch him: and so he sends some of his people to fire his
cornfieldsd; and that messenger after messenger, one sermon after another to
bring us in: we little regard it, but sit it out: and will not come in, till he
fire our corn, or do us some displeasure; and that, if any thing, will bring us.

29. Thirdly, we are full of worldly-mindedness. Adhaesit pavimento, Psalm.
119.25.
as David speaks in this Psalm; so may we say, but quite in another sense:
Our soul cleaves to the dust. We all complain, the world is naught, and so it
is, God mend it; ( totus in maligno) nothing but vanity and wickedness: 1 John
5.19.
and yet as bad as it is, our prosper in it, the more we grow in love with it:
the faster riches, or honors, or any of these other vanities increase, the
more eagerly do we pursue them, and the more fondly set our hearts upon them.
Only afflictions do now and then take us off somewhat, and a little embitter
the lushiousness of them to our taste. That we have any apprehension at all of
the vanity of the world, we may thank for it those vexations of spirit, Eccles.
2.11.
that are interwoven therewithal. Loving it as we do, being so full of those
vexations as it is; how absurdly should we dote upon it, if we should meet with
nothing in it to vex us?

30. Lastly, we are full of In-compassion. Our brethren that are in distress,
though they be our fellow members, yet have we little fellow feeling of their
griefs: but either we insult over them, or censure them, or at best neglect
them; especially when our selves are at ease. Amos ^.4 -- 6.
When we stretch our selves upon ivory beds, eat the fat drink the sweet, and
chaunt it to the vyals, live merry and full; it is great odds the afflictions
of Joseph will be but slenderly remembered; no more then Lazarus was at the rich
man's gates, where he found no pity, but what the dogs showed him. Luke 16.21.
But then when it comes to be our own case, when we fall into sicknesses,
disgraces, or other distresses our selves: Non ignara mali -- Virgil.
Then do our bowels, which before were crusted up, begin to relent a little
toward our poorer brethten; and our own misery makes charitable. Heb. 13.2.
Then we remember those that are in bonds, (whom we forgot before, as Pharaohs
butler forgot Joseph, Genesis 4.23.
) when we our selves are bound with them; and those that are in adversity, when
we find and feel that we our selves are but flesh. Thus God out of very
faithfulness causes us to be troubled; as for our good many other ways: so
particularly in purging out thereby some of that Pride, and Security, and
Worldliness, and Incompassion, (besides sundry other corruptions) that abound
in us.

31. That for the End. Next God manifests his faithfulness to his servants in
their troubles, by the proportion he holds therein: deservings, their
strength, or their comforts: very measurably in all. First, our sufferings are
far short of our deservings. He does ever chasten us citra condignum: (He
deals not with us after our sins, neither rewards us after our iniquities.
Psalm. 103.) After what then? Psalm. 103.10.
even after his own loving kindness, and fatherly affection toward us: Even as
a father pittieth his own children, as it there follows. And how that is,
Ibid. verse. 13.
every father can tell you: Pro magna culpa parum supplicij satis est patri.
When we for drinking in iniquity like water, had deserved to drink off the cup
of fury to the bottom, dregs and all, he makes sip a little overly of the
very brim. And when he might in justice lash us with scorpions, he does but
scourge us with rushes. The Lord promised his people Ier. 30. that though he
could not in justice, nor would, leave them altoge^her unpunished; yet he would
correct them in measure, and not make a full end of them. Ier. 30.11.
And he did indeed according to his promise: they found his faithfulness
therein, and acknowledged it; Ezr. 9.13.
( -- seeing that our God has punished less then our iniquities deserve. Ezr.
9.) Jacob confessed that he was less then the least of Gods mercies: and we
must confess, Genesis 32.10.
that we are more then the greatest of his corrections.

Secondly, he proportioneth our sufferings to our strength. As a discreet
Physician considers, as well as the malignity of the disease, the strength of
the patient: and prescribes for him accordingly, both for the ingredients, and
dose. Abraham, and Job, and David, and S. Paul, the Lord put them to great
trials: because he had endowed them with great strength. But as for most common
troubles upon us; because we have no more but common strength: as Jacob had a
good care not to overdrive the weaker cattle. Genesis 33.13. 2 Cor. 12.7, 9.
If he shall hereafter think good to send such a messenger of Satan against us,
as shall buffet us with stronger blows; doubtless, if we be his friends, and
do but seek to him for it, he will give us such an addition of strength and
grace, as shall be sufficient for our safety. The Apostle both observes Gods
thus dealing with us, and imputes it also to his faithfulness, 1 Cor. 10.13.
1 Cor. 10. God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above what
you are able. Either Cain said not truly; or if Genesis 4.13.
that his punishment was greater then he could bear. God is not so hard a
Master to us, (for all we are so slack and untoward in our service,) as either
to require that of us which he will not enable us to do, or lay that upon us
which he will not enable us to bear: if we will but lay our hands and our
shoulders thereunto, and put out our strength and endeavors to the utmost.

33. Thirdly, he proportioneth us out also comforts suitable to our afflictions:
every whit as large as they, and more effectual; to preserve us from drooping,
and to sustain our souls in the midst of smallest temptation would foil us,
if God should withold his grace from us; but if he vouchsafe us the
assistance of that, we are able to withstand the greatest: so the least
afflictions would over-whelme our spirits, if he should withold his comforts
from us; but if he afford us them, we are able to bear up under the greatest.
And God does afford unto his children in all their distresses, though not
perhaps always such comforts as they desire, yet ever such as he knows and
they find to be both meet and sufficient. Spiritual comforts first; and they
are the chiefest: the testimony of a good Conscience from within; Gods
favorable Countenance from above. These put more true joy into the heart,
Psalm. 4.6, 7.
then the want of Corn, or Wine, or Oil, or any outward thing, can sorrow;
And by these our inner man is so renewed and strengthened, that yet we faint
not, whatsoever becomes of our outward man; 2 Cor. 4.16.
no, not though it should perish. David had troubles, multitude of troubles,
troubles that touched him at the very heart: Psalm. 94.19.
but the comforts of God in his soul gave him more refreshing, then all those
troubles could work him vexation. Psalm. 94. And S. Paul found, that still as
his sufferings increased, 2 Cor. 1.5.
his comforts had withal such a proportionable abounded, these did rather
superabound. 2 Cor. 1.

34. These inward comforts are sufficient even alone. Yet God knows our frame
so well, and so far tendereth our weakness, that he does also afford us such
outward comforts, as he sees in bulk, and to the eye; but yet such as by his
mercy gives us mighty refreshing. For as any little affliction, scarce
considerable in it self, is yet able to work us much sorrow, if God mean to
make a rod of it: so any otherwise inconsiderable accident, when God is pleased
to make a comfort of it, is able to cheer us up beyond belief. The coming of
Titus out of Achaia into Macedonia, seemed to be a matter of no great
consequence: yet coming at such a time, and in the nick as it were, S. Paul
remembers it as a great mercy from God, and a great comfort to him in 2 Cor.
7. He was much fightings without, and fears within; insomuch as he was troubled
on every side, and his flesh had no rest; at the fifth verse there.
Nevertheless, says he, God that comfort those that are cast down, comforted
us by the coming of Titus, at ver. 6.

35. Thirdly, God manifests his love and faithfulness to his children in
their troubles, by the issues, that he gives out of them; Deliverance, and
Honor. Deliverance first. That God has often promised, ( Call upon me in the
time of trouble, and I will hear thee; Psalm. 50.) And he has faithfully
performed it; Psalm. 50.15.
(Many are the troubles of the Righteous, but the Lord delivers them out of
all. Psalm 34. And he delivers him safe and sound, Psalm. 34.19.
many times without the breaking of a bone, -- Ibid. v. 20.
yea sometimes without so much as the loss of a hair of his head. How often do
we hear it repeated in one Psalm, and made good by sundry instances; So when
they cried unto the Lord in their trouble, Psalm. 107.6.13, 19, 28.
he delivered them from their distress.

36. Some evidence it is of his love and faithfulness, that he delivers them
at all: but much more that he does it with the addition of honor. Yet has he
bound himself by his gracious promise (He shall call upon me, and I will hear
him; Psalm. 91.15.
yea I am with him in trouble: I will deliver him and bring him to honor.
Psalm 91. As gold cast into the furnace, receives there a new luster, and
shines brighter when it comes forth then it did before: so are the Saints of
God more glorious after their great afflictions; their graces evermore
resplendent, and many times even their outward estate also more honorable. We
may see in the examples of Joseph, of Job, of David himself, and others (if we
had time to produce them,) that of Psalm 113. verified: Psalm. 113.7, 8.
He raises the poor out of the dust, and lists the needy out of the mire,
and from that he may set him with Princes, even with the Princes of his people.
But we have an example beyond all example, even our blessed Savior Jesus
Christ. Never any sufferings so grievous as his: never man so emptied, and
trodden down, Esaias 53.3. Phil. 2.9 -- 11.
and made a man of sorrows, as he: Never any issues so honorable as his,
(...), God has highly exalted him, and given him a name above every name, that
at the Name of Jesus every knee should bow, and every tongue should And what
has befallen him the head, concerns us also his members: not only by way of
merit, but by way of conformity also. 2 Timothy 2.12.
Si compatimur, conregnabimus. If we be partakers of his sufferings, we shall
be also of his glory. God, as out of very faithfulness he does cause us to be
troubled, so will he out of the very same faithfulness give an honorable issue
also to all our troubles; if we cleave unto him by steadfast faith and constant
obedience: possibly in this life, if he see it useful for us; but undoubtedly
in the life to come. Whereunto etc.


WHITE HALL July 5. 1640.
1 COR. 10.23. All things are lawful for me; But all things are not expedient:
All things are lawful for me; But all things


1. IN which words the Apostle with much holy wisdom, by setting just bounds
unto our Christian Liberty, in the Power first, and then in the exercise of
that power; excellently preventeth both the Error of those that would shrink
it in, and the Presumption of those that would stretch it out, more then they
ought. He extends the Power, but restrains it in the use. Would you know,
what a large power God has permitted unto you in indifferent things; and what
may be done ex plenitudine potestatis, and without scruple of conscience? For
that you have, Omnia licent, All things are lawful. But would you know withal
with what caution you ought to use that power; and what at all times is fit to
ex intuitu charitatis, and for the avoiding of offense? You have for that too,
Non omnia expediunt, All things are not expedient, All things edify not. If we
will sail by this Card, regulate our judgment and practice by our Apostles
rule and example in the Text: we shall neither dash against the Rock of
Superstition on the right hand, nor fall into the Gulf of Profaneness on the
left; we shall neither betray our Christian Liberty, nor abuse it.

2. In the words themselves are apparently observable, concerning that Liberty,
two things: the Extension first, and then the Limitation of it. The Extension
is in the former clause: Wherein we have Things, and the Persons. (...), All
things lawful, and All lawful for me. The Limitation is in the later clauses:
wherein is declared first, what it is must limit us; and that is the reason of
Expediency; [But all things are not expedient.] And secondly, one special means
whereby to judge of that Expediency; which is the usefulness of it unto
Edification, [But all things edify not.] I am to begin with the Extension: of
which only at this time; And first and chiefly in respect of the things, (...)
-- All things are lawful.

3. What? All things? simply and without exception All? What meant John Baptist
then to come in with his Non licet to Herod about his Brothers Wife; Matthew.
14.4.
[ It is not lawful for thee to have her, Matthew. 14.] Or if John were an
austero man, and had too much of Elias's spirit in him: Yet how is it, that our
blessed Savior, the very Pharisees put a question to him, Mat. 19.3. -- 6
Whether it were lawful for a man to put away his Wife for every cause;
resolves it in effect, as if he had said, No, it is not lawful. S. Peter
says, the wicked Sodomites vexed the righteous soul of Lot daily with their
unlawful deeds. 2 Pet. 2.8.
And who, (that hearkneth to the holy Law of God, or but to the dictates of
natural conscience,) will not acknowledge blasphemy, idolatry, sacrilege,
perjury, oppression, incest, parricide, treason, etc. to be things altogether
unlawful? And does S. Paul now dissent so far from the judgment of his Master,
of his fellow-Apostle, of the whole World besides, as to pronounce all these
things, that they are lawful?

Here the rule of Logicians must help; Signa distributiva sunt intelligenda
accommodate ad subjectam materiam. Notes of Universality are not ever to be
understood in that fullness of latitude, which the words seem to import; but
most often with such convenient restrictions, as Me^ento distributionis
accommoda. Cajet. in 1 Cor. 6.
the matter in hand will require. Now the Apostle, by mentioning Expediency in
the Text, gives us clearly to understand, All things he intends all such
things only, whose Expediency or Inexpediency are meet to be taken into
consideration: as much as to say, All Indifferent things, and none other. For
things absolutely necessary, (although it may truly be said of them, that they
also are lawful;) yet are they quite beside the Apostles intention lawfulness
is not ad utrumlibet; it holds but the one way only, (for though it be
lawful to do them, yet is it not lawful to leave them undone:) as also, because
expedient or inexpedient, done they must be howsoever; for I must do my bounden
duty, though all the World should take offense thereat. And on the other side
things absolutely forbidden, such as those before mentioned and sundry others,
are of themselves utterly unlawful, and may not in any case be done, seem they
never so expedient: for I may not do any evil, for any good that may ensue
thereof. Romans 3 8.
But then there are Quae in medio sunt, and a Graecis tum (...) tum (...)
appellantur, -- per sese ipsa neque honesta, neque turpia. A. Gel. 2. noct.
Attic. 7.
(...) (as they call them) things of a middle nature, that are neither
absolutely commanded, nor absolutely forbidden; but are left to every man's
choice either to do or to leave undone, as ^e shall see cause: Indifferent
things. Of these the Apostle speaks freely, and universally, and without
exception, that they are all lawful. Chrysostom. Hom. 17. in 1 Cor.
(...), says S. Chrysostom; and Heming.
de medio genere rerum, others; and to the same effect, most Interpreters.

5. Somewhat we have gained toward the better understanding of the Text; yet
not much, unless it may withal certainly appear, what things are Indifferent,
and what not: for all the wrangling action or thing whatsoever, that cannot by
just and logical deduction either from the light of Nature, or from the written
Word of God, be shown to be either absolutely necessary, or simply unlawful; I
say, every such action or thing is in its own nature indifferent; and
consequently permitted by our gracious Lord God to our free liberty and choice,
from time to time, either to do, or to leave undone, either to use, or to
forbear the use, as in godly wisdom and charity (acccording to the just
exigence of circumstances) we shall see it expedient.

Romans 14.14.
I know and am persuaded that there is nothing unclean of it self: and again,
All things indeed are pure. To Titus; -- ibid. 20. Tit. 1.15.
To the pure all things are pure. To these Corinthians once before, he has
words in part the same with these of the Text; All things are lawful for me,
but all things are not expedient: All things are lawful for me, 1 Cor. 6.12.
but I will not be brought under the power of any. He repeateth it there twice,
as he does also here ( All things are lawful, and again, All things are
lawful:) no doubt of purpose that we should take the Timothy lastly, (for I
quote but such places only as have the note of Universality expressed, 1 Timothy
4.4.
) Every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused.

7. From all which places it is evident, that we have a free and universal
liberty allowed us by our gracious Lord and Master to every Creature in the
World. So as that, whatsoever natural faculties or properties he has endowed
any of them withal, or whatsoever benefit or improvement we can raise out of
any such their faculties or properties by any our art, skill, or industry, we
may serve our selves of them both for our necessity and comfort: provided ever,
that we keep our selves within the bounds of sobriety, charity, and other
requisite conditions. And then it will also follow farther, and no less
certainly, ( our selves being in the number of those creatures,) that we have
the like liberty to exercise all those several faculties, abilities, and
endowments whether of soul or body or outward things, which it has pleased God
to allot us: and consequently to build, and plant, and alter; to buy and sell
and exchange; to obey laws, to rites and fashions and customs, to use
recreations, and generally to perform all the actions of common life, as
occasions shall require; still provided, as before, that all due conditions be
duly observed.

8. Injurious then are all they to true Christian liberty, and adversaries to
the truth of God, as it is constantly taught by this blessed Apostle; who
either impose any of those things as necessary, or else condemn any of them as
unlawful, which it was the gracious pleasure of our good God, to leave free,
arbitrary and indifferent. Both extremes are superstitious; both derogatory to
the honor of God, and the liberty of his people: both strong symptoms of that
great pride that cleaves to the spirit of corrupt man, in daring to piece out
the holy Word of God, by tacking thereunto his own devices.

9. Extremely faulty this way, especially in the former branch, in laying a
necessity where they should not, are they of the Romish party. For after that
the Bishops of Rome had begun by the advantages of the times to lift themselves
toward that superlative height of greatness, whereto at length they attained;
they began withal, for the better support of that greatness, to exercise a
grievous tyranny over the consciences of men, by obtruding upon them their own
inventions, both in points of faith and manners; and those to be received,
believed, and obeyed, Abutuntur sua potestate, qui quicquid ordinant, volunt id
robur habere per obligationem ad poenam aeternam. Gerson part. 3. de vit.
spirit. lect 4.
under pain of damnation: whereby they became the authors, and still are the
continuers, of the widest schism, that ever was in the Church of Christ from
the very first infancy thereof. The Anabaptists also and Separatists, by
striving to run so far as they can from Popery, have run themselves unawares
even as deep as they, and that in the very same fault, (I mean, as to the
general of Superstition;) though quite on the other hand, and upon quite
different grounds: for they offend more in the latter branch, in laying an
unlawfulness where they should not.

10. But I shall not meddle much with either sort, though they are deeply
guilty both: because professedly abhorring all communion with us, I presume
none of them Abutuntur sua potestate, qui quicquid ordinant, volunt id robur
habere per obligationem ad poenam aeternam. Gerson part. 3. de vit. spirit.
lect 4.
will hear; and then what booteth it to speak? There be others, who for that
they live in the the same visible communion with us, do even therefore deserve
far better respect from us then either of the former; and are also even
therefore more capable of better information from us then they. Who yet by
their unnecessary and unwarrantable strictness in sundry particulars, and by
casting impurity upon many things both of Ecclesiastical and civil usage, which
are not in their own nature unlawful, though some of them (I doubt not) in
their practice much abused, have done, and still do, a world of mischief in the
Church of Christ. A great deal more, I am verily persuaded, then themselves are
aware of, or then themselves (I hope) intend: but I fear withal a great deal
more, then either any of us can imagine, or all help. That therefore both they
and we may see, how needful a thing it is for every of us to have a right
judgment concerning indifferent things, and their lawfulness: I shall
endeavor to show you, both how unrighteous a thing it is in it self, and of
how noysom and perilous consequence many ways, to condemn any thing as simply
unlawful, without very clear evidence to lead us thereunto.

11. First, it is a very unrighteous thing. For as in civil judicatories, the
Judge that should make no more ado, but presently adjudge to death all such
persons as should be brought before him, upon presumptions, without any due
enquiry into the cause, or expecting clearer evidence, must needs pass many an
unjust sentence, and be in great jeopardy at some time or other of shedding
innocent blood: so he that is very forward, when the lawfulness of any thing
is called in question, upon some colorable exceptions there-against
straightwayes to cry it down, and to pronounce it unlawful; can hardly avoid
the falling, oftentimes into error, and sometimes into uncharitableness.
Pilate, though he did Jesus much wrong afterward, yet he did him some right
onward, when the Jews cried out Crucisige, Away with him, crucify him; in why
what evil has he done? Matthew. 27.22, 23. John 7.51.
Does our law judge a man before it hear him, and know what he does? was
Nicodemus his plea, John 7. I wonder then by what Law those men proceed, who
judge so deeply, and yet examine so overly: speaking evil of those things they
know not, as S. Jude; and answering a matter before they hear it, as Solomon
speaks. Jude v.10. Prove. 18.13.
Which in his judgment is both folly and shame to them: as who say, there is
neither wit nor honesty in it. The Prophet Esaias to show the righteousness and
equity of Christ in the exercise of his kingly office, describes it thus Esaias
11. Esaias 11.3, 4.
He shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither reprove after the
hearing of his ears: but with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and
reprove Implying, that where there is had a just regard of righteousness and
equity, there will be had also a due care not to proceed (...), according to
our first apprehension of things, as they are suddenly represented to our eyes
or ears, without farther examination. A fault which our Savior reproved in the
Jews, as an unrighteous thing, when they censured him as a sabbath-breaker
without Joh. 7.24.
Judge not according to the outward appearance, but judge righteous judgment
Joh. 7.

12. All this will easily be granted, may some say, where the case is plain.
But suppose, when the Lawfulness of something is called in question, that there
be probable arguments on both sides, so as it is not easy to resolve, whether
way rather to incline: is it not, at leastwise in that case, better to suspect
it may be unlawful, then to presume it to be lawful? For in doubtful cases via
tutior: it is best ever to take the safer way. Now because there is in most men
a wondrous aptness to stretch their liberty to the utmost extent,
licentiousness; and so there may be more danger in the enlargement, then there
can be in the restraint of our liberty: it seems therefore to be the safer
error, in doubtful cases to judge the things unlawful, say that should prove
an error; rather then to allow them lawful, and yet that prove an error.

13. True it is, that in hypothesi and in point of practice, and in things not
enjoined by superior authority either divine or humane; it is the safer way
(if we have any doubts that trouble us,) to forbear the doing of them for
fear they should prove unlawful, adventure to do them, before we be well
satisfied that they are lawful. As for example, If any man should doubt of the
lawfulness of playing at Cards, or of Dancing either single or mixed, (although
I know no just cause why any man should doubt of either severed from the abuses
and accidental consequents;) yet if any man shall think he has just cause so
to do: that man ought by all means to forbear such playing or dancing, till he
can be satisfied in his own mind, that he may lawfully use the same. The
Apostle has clearly resolved the case Romans 14. that be the thing what it can
be in it self, yet his very doubting makes it unlawful to him, so long as he
remains doubtful: because it cannot be of faith, and whatsoever is not of
faith is sin. Thus far therefore the former allegation may hold good; Romans
14.23.
so long as we consider things but in hypothesi; that is to say, only so far
forth as concerns our own particular in point of practice: that in these
doubtful cases, it is safer to be too scrupulous then too adventurous.

14. But then, if we will speak of things in thesi (that is to say, taken in
their general nature, and considered in themselves, and as they stand divested
of all circumstances;) and in point of judgment, sentence either with them, or
against them: there I take it the former allegation of Via tutior, is so far
from being of force, that it holds rather the clean contrary way. For in
bivio dextra: in doubtful cases, it is safer erring (...). Naz. orat. 25. Inter
dispares sententias mitior vincat. Senec. 1. controv. 5.
the more charitable way. As a Judge upon the bench Satius est impunitum
relinqui faci^us nocentis, quam innocentem condemna^i. l. absentem. ff. de
poenis.
acquit ten malefactors if there be no full proof brought against them, then
condemn but one innocent person upon mere presumptions. And this seems to be
very reasonable. For as in the Courts of civil Justice, men are not ordinarily
put to prove themselves honest men, but the proof lies on Actori incumbit
probatio.
the accusers part; and it is sufficient for the acquiting of any man in foro
externo, that there is nothing of moment proved against him: (for in the
construction of the Law every man is presumed to be an honest man, till he be
proved otherwise:) But to the condemning of a man there is more requisite then
so: bare suspicions are not enough, no nor strong presumptions neither; but
there must be a clear and full especially if the trial concern life. So in
these moral trials also in foro interno, when enquiry is made into the
lawfulness or unlawfulness of humane acts in their several kinds: it is
sufficient to warrant any act in the kind to be Certe verum est, permissum
esse quicquid non prohibetur. Chamier. 1 panstrat. Cathol. lib. 9. cap. 20.11.
Licita sunt, quae nullo praecepto Dei prohibentur. Aug. de adulter. conjug. ca.
14. Omnia non prohibita licent. Cajettan. in 1 Cor. 6.
lawful, that there can be nothing produced from scripture or sound reason to
prove it unlawful. For so much the words of my Text do manifestly import, All
things are lawful for me. But to condemn any act as simply and utterly unlawful
in the kind; remote consequences and weak deductions from Scripture-Text should
not serve the turn: neither yet reasons of inconveniency or inexpediency,
though carrying with unlawfulness thereof should be (...). Chrysostom. in Genesi^
hom. 42.
sufficiently demonstrated, either from express and undeniable testimony of
scripture, or from the clear light of natural reason; or at leastwise from some
conclusions properly directly and evidently deduced therefrom. If we condemn
it before this be done, our judgment therein is rash and unrighteous.

15. Nor is that all: I told you, besides the unrighteousness of it in it self,
that it is also of very noisome and perilous consequence many ways. Sundry the
evil and pernicious effects Incharitableness. For although difference of
judgment should not alienate our affections one from another: yet daily
experience shows it does. By reason of that self-love, and envy, and other
corruptions that abound in us; it is rarely seen that those men are of one
heart, that are of two minds. S. Paul found it so with the Romans in his time:
whilst some condemned that as unlawful, which others practiced as lawful; they
judged one another, and despised one another perpetually. Romans 14.2, 3.
any-whit-like acquainted with the wretched deceitfulness of man's heart, Ier.
17.9.
may easily conclude how hard a thing it is, (if at all possible,) not to think
somewhat hardly of those men, that take the liberty to do such things as we
judge unlawful. As for example. If we shall judge all walking into the fields,
discoursing occasionally on moderate recreations on the Lords day, to be
grievous prophanations of the sabbath; how can we choose but judge those men
that use them to be grievous prophaners of Gods sabbath? And if such our
judgment concerning the things should after prove to be erroneous: then can it
not be avoided, but that such our judgment also concerning the persons must
needs be uncharitable.

16. Secondly, this mis-judging of things fills the world with endless
nicities and disputes; to the great disturbance of the Churches which to every
good man ought to be precious. The multiplying of books and writings pro and
con, and pursuing of arguments with heat and opposition, does rather lengthen,
then decide controversies* and insted of destroying the old, begets new
ones: whiles they that are in the wrong out of obstinacy will not, and they
that stand for the truth out of conscience dare not, may not yield; and so
still the war goes on.

17. And as to the public peace of the Church. so is there also thirdly by
this means great prejudice done to the peace and tranquillity of private men's
consciences: when by the peremptory doctrines of rigid masters, the souls of
many a well-meaning man are miserably disquieted with a thousand unnecessary
scruples, and driven sometimes into very woeful perplexities. Surely it can be
no light matter, thus to lay heavy burdens upon other men's shoulders, Mat.
23.3. 1 Cor. 7.35. Mat. 7.14.
and to cast a snare upon their consciences, by making the narrow way to heaven
(...). Nazianzen. orat. 26.
narrower then ever God meant it.

18. Fourthly, hereby Christian Governors come to be robbed of a great part of
that honor that is due unto them from their people; both in their Affections,
and Subjection. For when they shall see cause to exercise over us that power
that God has left them in indifferent things, by commanding such or such
things to be done; wearing of a surplice, kneeling at the communion, and tho
like: if now we in our own thoughts have already prejudged any of the things so
commanded to be unlawful; it cannot be but our hearts will be sowred toward
our superiors, in whom we ought to rejoice: and instead of blessing God for
them, (as we are bound to do, 1 Timothy 2.1, 2.
and that with hearty cheerfulness;) we shall be ready to speak evil of them,
Jude. ver. 8.
even with open mouth, so far as we dare for fear of being shent. Or if out of
that fear we do it but indirectly and obliquely; yet we will be sure to do it
in such a manner, authority as may be. But then as for our Obedience, we think
our selves clearly discharged of that: it being granted on all hands (as it
ought) that superiors commanding unlawful things, are not therein to be obeyed.

Error should deprive our Superiors of that right they have to our obedience,
(for why should any man reap or challenge benefit from his own act?) we do by
this means fifthly exasperate those that are in authority, Eccles. 10.4.
and make the spirit of the ruler rise against us, which may hap to fall right
heavy on us in the end. All power we know, whether natural or civil, striveth
to maintain it self at the height, for the better preserving of it self: the
Natural from decay; and the Civil, from contempt. When we therefore withdraw
from the higher powers our due obedience, what do we other then pull upon our
selves their just displeasure; and put the opportunity, (if they shall but be
as ready to take it, as we are to give it,) rather to extend their power.
Whereby if we suffer in the conclusion, (as not unlike we may; Homer Iliad.
(...).
(...) --) whom may we thank for it but our selves?

20. Sixthly, by this means we cast our selves upon such sufferings, as (the
cause being naught) we can have no sound comfort in. -- cum martyrem faciat,
non pana, sed causa. August. epist. 61. and ep. 167.
Causa, non passio, we know: it is the cause makes a true Martyr or
Confessor, and not barely the suffering. He that suffers for the truth, and
a good cause, suffers as a Christian; and he need not be but may exult in the
midst of his greatest sufferings, chearing up his own heart, and glorifying God
on that behalf. But he that suffers for his error, or disobedience, or other
rashness, 1 Pet. 4.16.
builds his comfort upon a sandy foundation: and cannot better glorify God,
and discharge a good conscience, then by being ashamed of his fault, and
retracting it.

21. Seventhly, hereby we expose not our selves only (which yet is something;)
but sometimes also (which is a far greater matter,) the whole Reformed Religion
by our default, to the insolent jeers of Atheists, and Papists, and other
profane and scornful spirits. For men that have wit enough and to spare, but no
more religion the Laws, when they see such men as pretend most to holiness, to
run into such extravagant opinions and practices, as in the judgment of any
understanding man are manifestly ridiculous: they cannot hold but their wits
will be working; and whilst they play upon them, and make themselves sport
enough therewithal, it shall go hard but they will have one fling among, even
at the power of Religion too. Even as the Stoics of old, though they stood
mainly for virtue; yet because they did it in such an uncouth and rigid as
seemed to be repugnant not only to Sensus cujusque, and natura rerum, atque
ipsa veritas clamat. Cic. 4. de finib. Sensus moresque repugnant. Horat. 1.
Sat. 3
the manners of men, but almost to common sense also: they gave occasion to the
wits of those times, under a color of making themselves merry with the
Paradoxes of the Stoics, to laugh even true virtue it self out of countenance.

22. Lastly, (for why should I trouble you with any more? these are enough:) by
condemning sundry indifferent things, and namely Church-Ceremonies as unlawful;
we give great scandal to those of the Separation, to their farther confirming
in that their unjust schism. For why should these men, will they say, (and for
ought I know, they speak but reason;) why should they who agree so well with us
in our principles, hold off from our Conclusions? Why do they yet hold
communion with, or remain in the bosom of that Church, that imposes such
unlawful things upon them? Rev. 3.16.
How are they not guilty themselves of that lukewarm Laodicean temper,
wherewith they so often and so deeply charge others? 3 King. 18.21.
Why do they halt so shamefully between two opinions? Baal be God, and the
Ceremonies lawful; why do they not yield obedience, cheerful obedience, to
their Governors, so long as they command but lawful things? But if Baal be an
Idol, and the ceremonies unlawful, as they and we consent: why do they not
either set them packing, or (if they cannot get that done,) pack themselves
away from them as fast as they can, either to Amsterdam, or to some other
place? The Objection is so strong, that I must confess for my own part, If I
could see cause to admit of those principles, whereon most of our
Non-conformers and such as favor them ground their dislike of our
Church-Orders and Ceremonies; I should hold my self in all conscience bound
(for any thing I yet ever read Church of England, and to fly out of Babylon,
before I were many weeks older.

23. Truly Brethren, if these unhappy fruits were but accidental events
only, occasioned rather then caused by such our opinions; I should have
thought the time misspent in but naming them: since the very best things that
are may by accident produce evil effects. but being they do in very truth
naturally and unavoidably issue therefrom, as from their true and proper cause:
I cannot but earnestly beseech all such as are otherwise minded, in the bowels
and in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and by all the Clergy, that have
most authority in the hearts of such as byasse too much that way, (for they
only may have some hope to prevail with them; the rest are shut out by
prejudice:) if I were in place where, I should require and charge them, as they
will answer the contrary to God, the Church, and their own consciences; that
they would approve their faithfulness in their ministry, by giving their best
diligence to inform the judgments of Gods people indifferent things: and (as
in love to their souls they are bound,) that they would not humor them in
these their pernicious errors, nor suffer them to continue therein for want of
their rebuke, Levit. 19.17.
either in their public

24. But you will say, If these things were so, how should it then come to
pass that so many men pretending, to godliness, (and thousands of them
doubtless such as they pretend; for it were an uncharitable thing to charge
them all with hypocrisy:) should so often and so grievously offend this way?
To omit those two more universal causes; Almighty Gods permission first, whose
good pleasure it is, for sundry wise and gracious ends, to exercise his Church
during her warfare here with heresies and schisms and scandals: 1 Cor. 11.19.
Luke 17.1.
And then the wiliness of Satan, who cunningly observes whither way our hearts
incline most, to looseness, or to strictness; and then frames temptations
thereafter: So he can but put us out of the way; it is no great matter to him,
on whether hand it be: he has his end howsoever. Nor to insist upon sundry
more particular causes: as namely, a natural proneness in all men to
superstition: in many an affection of singularity, to go beyond the ordinary
sort of people in something or other; the difficulty of shunning one without
running into the contrary extreme; the great force of education and custom;
besides manifold abuses, offenses, and provocations, arising from the carriage
of others; and the rest: I shall note but these two great fountains of Error,
(to which also most of the other may be reduced,) Ignorance, and Partiality:
from neither of which Gods dearest servants and children are in this life wholly
exempted.

25. Ignorance first is a fruitful mother of Error. (Ye err, not knowing the
scriptures. Matthew. 22. Matthew. 22.29.
) Yet not so much gross Ignorance neither: I mean not that. For your mere
Ignaro's, what they err, they err for company: they judge not all, neither
according to the appearance, nor yet righteous judgment. They only run on with
the herd, and follow as they are lead, be it right or Ignorance I mean --
hominum leviter eruditorum -- Cic. 3. de orator.
weakness of judgment* which consists in a disproportion between the
affections, and the understanding: when a man is very (...). Nazi. orat. 26.
Ephesians. 5.6.
earnest, but withal very shallow; reads much, and hears much, and
thinks he knows much, but has not the judgment to sever truth from
falsehood, nor to discern between a sound argument and a captious fallacy. And
so for want of ability to examine the soundness and strength of those
principles, from whence he fetches his conclusions; he is easily carried away
(...), as our Apostle elsewhere speaks, with vain words, and empty arguments.
S. Augustine said of Donatus, Augustine. 4. de bapt. contra Donat. 6.
Rations arripuit, he catches hold of some reasons, (as wranglers will catch
at a small thing, rather then yield from their opinions,) quas considerantes,
verisimiles esse potius quam veras invenimus; which says he, we found to have
more show of probability at the first appearance, then substance of truth after
they were well considered of.

And I dare say, whosoever shall peruse with a judicious and unpartial
Pamphlets, that in this daring age have been thrust into the World, against the
Ceremonies of the Church, against Episcopal government; (to pass by things of
lesser regard and usefulness, and more open to exception and abuse, yet so far
as I can understand, unjustly condemned as things utterly unlawful; such as are
lusorious lots, dancing, Stage Plays, and some other things of like nature;)
When he shall have drained out the bitter invectives, unmannerly jeers,
petulant girding at those that are in authority, impertinent digressions, but
above all those most bold and perverse wrestings of holy Scripture, wherewith
such books are infinitely vain words and empty arguments. For when these great
undertakers have snatched up the bucklers, as if they would make it good against
all comers, that such and such things are utterly unlawful; and therefore ought
in all reason and conscience, to bring such proofs as will come up to that
conclusion: Quid dignum tanto? very seldom shall you hear from them any other
arguments, then such as will conclude but an Inexpediency at the most. As, that
they are apt to give scandal; that they carry with them an appearance of evil;
that they are often occasions of sin; that they are not commanded in the Word;
and such like. Which Objections, even where they are just, are not of force,
(no not taken altogether, much less any of them singly,) to prove a thing
utterly unlawful. And yet are they glad many times, rather then sit out, to
play very small game, and to make use of Arguments yet weaker then these, and
such as will not reach so far as to prove a bare inexpediency. As, that they
were invented by Heathens; that they have been abused in Popery; and other such
like. Which to my understanding is a very strong presumption, that they have
taken a very weak cause in hand, and such as is wholly destitute of sound
proof: For if they had any better arguments, think ye we should not be sure to
hear of them?

27. Marvel not therefore, if I charge them with Ignorance: some of them may
show much variety of reading, (As Parker, Di^oclavius, etc.)
and other pieces of learning and knowledge. For if their knowledge were even
much more then it is, yet if it should not hold pace with their zeal, but
suffer that to outrun it; there should be still in them that disproportion
that before I spoke of: and they might so far forth be ranked with those silly
women our Apostle speaks of, 2 Timothy 3.7.
(for such disproportion is very incident to the weaker that are ever learning,
but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. And this kind of
Ignorance is evermore very troublesome; and has been the raiser of most of
those stirs, that so much disquiet either whole Churches, or particular
congregations: as the lame Horse ever raises the most dust; and Zelus absque
scientia, quo vehementi^s irruit, and gravius corruit. Bernard. de verbis Esai.
Sermon. 4.
the faster he puts on, the more dust. Have you observed any men to be
fuller of molestation in the places where they live, then those that have been
somewhat toward the Law; or having some little smattering therein, think
themselves for that a great deal wiser then the rest of their neighbors?
Although such busy spirits for the most part make it appear to the World
before they have done, that they had but just so much Law, as would serve them
to vex their neighbors withal in the mean time, and undo themselves in the
end. Zeal is a kind of fire. An excellent creature Fire, as it may be used;
but yet may do a great deal of mischief too, as it may be used: as we use to
good servant, but an ill Master. A right zeal, grounded upon certain knowledge,
and guided with godly discretion, like fire on the hearth, is very comfortable
and serviceable: but blind or undiscreet zeal, like fire in the thatch, will
soon set all the house in a combustion.

28. So much for Ignorance, the first great Fountain of Error: the other is
Partiality. And this is causa causarum: much of that ignorance and ill-governed
zeal, from which so many other errors spring, does it self spring from this
corrupt Fountain of Partiality. Which makes the Error so much the worse; and
the judgment Error proceeds merely from weakness, though it cannot be
therefore excused, much less ought to be therefore cherished; yet may it be
even therefore pitied, Juvenal. Satyr. 2.
horum simplicitas miserabilis -- and the rather born with for a time. But if
it shall once appear that partiality runs along with it, or especially that
it proceeds from partiality; this renders it odious both to God and man. S.
Paul therefore, well knowing what mischiefs would come of it, Church Governors
in the administration of their weighty callings should be swayed with partial
affections, either for or against any, lays a great charge upon Timotheus
Ephesiorum Episcopus ordinaius a B. Paulo.

Hieron. de Script. Eccles. cap. 11.


Timothy, whom he had ordained Bishop of Ephesus, and that with a most deep and
solemn obtostation, by all means to beware of Partiality. ( I charge thee
before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect Angels, that thou observe
these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by
partiality. 1 Timothy 5.)

29. And reason good; 1 Timothy 5.21.
there being scarce any thing more directly contrarious to the rules of
Charity, Equity, and Justice, then Partiality is: as might be easily shown, if
we had time for it. And unjust, unequal, and uncharitable as it is, the world
abounds with it for all that. Not to instance in the writing of histories,
handling of Controversies, distribution of rewards and punishments, and other
particulars: take but a general view of the ordinary passages of most men's
lives either in the carriage of their own, or in the censuring of other men's
actions; and you shall find partiality to bear Nemo non est ^enignus sui
Judeae. Senec. 2. de. benef. 26.
all partial: and shall be as long as we live here, more or less. For
Partiality is the daughter of Pride and Hypocrisy: both which are as
universally spread and as deeply and inseparably rooted in our nature, as any
other corruptions whatsoever. Pride ever makes a man to look at himself and
(...). Naz. orat. 2^.
his own party with favor; and at the opposites, either with envy if they be
above him, or if below him with scorn: and how can such a man choose but be
partial? And Hypocrisy ever leans on a nail: it will make a man halt
before his best friends, go upright. The spying of motes in our brothers eye,
and baulking of beams in our own, (which is Partiality,) our Savior therefore
charge with Hypocrisy; Luke 6.42.
( Thou Hypocrite first cast the beam out of thine own eye. Luke 6.) And S.
James coupleth them together, as things that seldom go asunder; Jam. 2.17.
(...), without partiality and without hypocrisy.

30. Besides these two internal causes, (Pride and Hypocrisy) from within,
which first breed it: there are sundry other external causes of Partiality from
without, which after it is bred, help to Education and Custom; which commonly
lays such strong anticipations upon the judgment, that it is a matter of
great difficulty to work out those Id sapit unusquisque quod didicit. Seneca.

first impressions afterward by any strength of reason; or but so much as to
bring us to suspect there can be any error in those things, whereto our ears
have bin so long enured. Another is, that which the Apostle calls the having
of men's persons in admiration: when we have such a high opinion of some men, as
to receive whatsoever they deliver, as the undoubted oracles of God, though
wanting both probability and proof; and such a prejudice again on the other
side against some others, though perhaps sapere ad palatum,) be it laid down
never so clearly, proved never so substantially. But I must omit both these,
and the rest: only one I cannot choose but name, because it so much concerns
this point of lawfulness, whereof we now speak; and it belongs also to this
last mentioned branch of admiring men's persons. And that is, the great credit
that is usually given to such Divines, as in their Expositions of the
Commandments, or other treatises cases of conscience, have set a Non licet
upon very many things, and that with very much confidence, and yet upon very
weak grounds. Yea so corruptibly, or slightly, is that useful part of Divinity
handled by most that have traveled therein, either in the Romish or Reformed
Churches; that scarc^ is to be found one just volume in that kind, able to
give satisfaction to a reader that is both rational and conscientious, in
sundry weighty points: and namely in those two, then which there are few of
more general use in our daily conversation; to wit, the point of Christian
Liberty, and the point of Christian Subjection. By means whereof, many of them
that should teach others better, are many times themselves miss-taught: and so
the blind leading the blind, both teachers and people are plunged deep either
in superstition, or disobedience, or both, before they ever so much as mistrust
themselves to have stepped awry. But of this enough.

the things, whereof we have hitherto spoken ((...), All things:) the Apostles
expressing of his own person, (...), not only all these lawful, but all lawful
for me; though I will not press it much, yet may not be wholly neglected. There
is an opinion taken up in this last age, that has passed for current amongst
many, grounded upon one mis-understood passage in this Epistle; 1 Cor. 3.22, 23.
but is indeed both false in it self, and dangerous in the consequents: namely
this, that the godly regenerate have a full right to all the creatures; but
wicked and unregenerate men have right to none, but are malae fidei
possessores, intruders and usurpers of those things they have, and shall
abusing of them, but even for their very possessing of them. Possibly some may
imagine, (yet none but they whose judgments are forestalled with that fancy,)
that these words of our Apostle look that way; and that there lies an Emphasis
in the pronoun, to this sense: All things are lawful for me; but not so for
every man. Being a godly and regenerate man, and engraffed into Christ by
faith, I have a right and liberty to all the Creatures, which every man has
not.

32. But to feign such a sense to these words, besides, that it the Text; it
does indeed quite overthrow the Apostles main purpose in this part of his
discourse: which is to teach the Corinthians and all others, to yield something
from their lawful liberty for their brethrens sakes, when they shall see it
needful so to do, either for the avoiding of private scandal, or for the
preservation of the public peace. So that the Apostle certainly here intended,
to extend our liberty to the creatures, as far and wide, in respect of the
persons, as of the things: as if he had said, All things are lawful for all
men. The interlinear Gloss is right here, Quod sibi dicit licere, innuit and de
We know it is an usual thing, as in our ordinary speech, so in the Scriptures
too; in framing objections, in putting cases, and the like, to make the
instance personal, where the aim is general. As Romans 3. Romans 3.7.
If the truth of God have abounded through my lie unto his glory, why am I also
judged as a sinner? that is, through my lie, or any man's else: why either I, or
any man else? So 1 Cor. 10.29. -- Ibid. 30.
Why is my liberty judged -- and why am I evil spoken of --? mine, or any man's
else? I, or any man else? And so in a hundred places more.

33. There is no great necessity therefore, for ought I see, that we should
place any Emphasis at all in the pronoun (...). Or if we do, it must then be
understood, as if the Apostle intended thereby, not to exclude others; (thus
All things are lawful for me, that is, for me rather then for some others:) but
only to include himself; as thus, All things are lawful for me, that is for me
also as well as for others. He did not conceive, that his Apostolical calling
did any Christian liberty, or abridge it: but that notwithstanding he was set
apart for the service of Christ in the work of the ministry, (...). Romans 1.1.
he had still the same fullness of power and right that ever he had, or that any
other person had to all the good creatures of God. S. Paul was content to
forbear his power in some things: but he would not forgo it tho in any thing.
He used his liberty indeed very sparingly, but yet he maintained it most
stoutly. Am I not an Apostle? am I not free? have we not power to eat and drink
as well as others? 1 Cor. 9.1. etc.
to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as others? to forbear working as well
as others? in the Chapter before

34. I find not any where in scripture, that the Priesthood of the Gospel does
render a man incapable of any thing, whereunto he has either a natural, or
civil liberty: but that whatsoever is lawful for any other man to do, is
lawful also for a Churchman to do, notwithstanding his ministerial office and
calling. What is decent and expedient for a Minister of the Gospel to do, that
is quite another business: I speak now only of lawfulness, which respects the
things themselves only, considered in their own nature, and in the general,
without relation either to the opinions and fashions of times decency; or to
such particular circumstances, as attend particular actions, which ought to be
the measure of Expediency.

35. For a grave Clergyman to wear a green suite, a cap and feather, and a
long lock on the one side; or to work journey-work in some mechanic or
manual trade, as with a Mason, Carpenter, or Shoemaker: as things are now
settled among us, no wise man can think it either decent, or expedient. Yet that
decency and expediency set aside, no man can truly say, that the doing of any
of this is simply unlawful. For why might not an English Minister, if Turkey,
to make an escape, disguise himself in such a habit as aforesaid? which if it
were simply unlawful, rather then do it, he should dye a thousand deaths. And
why it should not be as lawful now for a Minister, as it was once for an
Apostle, to work journey-work, to make shoes now, as then to tents, Acts 18.3.
(if it might stand with decency and expediency now as well as then:) let him
that can show a reason. Let them look how they will answer it therefore, that
make it unlawful for Priests, either to marry, as some do; or to be in
commission of the peace, as some others do: as if either the state of Wedlock,
or the exercise of temporal jurisdiction, were inconsistent with holy Orders.
When the maintainers of either opinion shall, show good Text for what they
teach, the cause shall be yielded: but till that be done, they must pardon us
if we appeal them both of Pharisaism, in teaching for doctrines men's precepts.
Matthew. 15.9.
So long as this Text stands in the Bible unexpunged, All things are lawful for
me: Rome or elsewhere, nay if an Angel from heaven, should teach either of
those things to be unlawful, and bring no better proof for it then yet has
been done, he must excuse me if I should not be very forward to believe him.

36 Well, you see the Apostle here extends our liberty very far in
indifferent things; without exception either of things or persons: All things
lawful, and lawful for all men. In the asserting of which liberty, if in any
thing I have spoken at this time, I may seem to any man to have set open a wide
gap to carnal licentiousness: I must entreat at his hands one of these three
things; and the request First, that all prejudice and partiality laid aside, he
would not judge (...), according to the appearance, but according to right and
truth; John 7.24.
and then I doubt not but all shall be well enough. Or Secondly, that he would
consider, whether these words of our Apostle taken by themselves alone, do not
seem to set open the gap as wide, as I or any man else can stretch it; Omnia
licent, All things are lawful for me. Or that Thirdly, he would at leastwise
suspend his judgment, till I shall have handled the latter clauses of my Text
also, wherein our liberty is restrained, as it is here extended. Then, (which
may be ere long, if God will,) he gap, if any such be, sufficiently stopped up
again, to keep out all carnal licentiousness, and other abuse of Christian
liberty whatsoever. In the mean time, and at all times, God grant us all to
have a right judgment, and to keep a good conscience in all things.

II. Ser. on 1 COR. 10.23. -- But all things are not expedient --


1. THe former clause of the Verse, here twice repeated, ( All things are
lawful for me) contains the Extension; as these later clauses do the
Limitation of that Liberty that God has left us to things of indifferent
nature. That Extension I have already handled; and set our Christian liberty
there, where (according to the constant our Apostle;) I think it should stand.
From what I then delivered, (which I now repeat not,) plain it was, that the
Apostle extends our liberty very far, without exception either of things or
persons. All things lawful, and lawful for all men. All the fear was, lest by
so asserting our liberty, we might seem to set open a gap to carnal
licentiousness. Although there be no great cause for it in respect of the thing
it self, yet is not that fear altogether needless our corruption: who are apt
to turn the very best things into abuse, and liberty as much as any thing. Yet
that fear need not much trouble us, if we will but take these later clauses of
the verse also along with us, as we ought to do. Where we shall find the gap,
if any such were, sufficiently made up again, to keep out all carnal
licentiousness, and other abuse of Christian liberty whatsoever.

2. Of those clauses we are now to speak; But all things are not expedient: But
all things edify not. Wherein the Apostle having before extended our liberty
in the power, now restrains it in the use three Observations, grounded all
upon the Text. First, that the Apostle establishes the point of lawfulness,
before he meddle with that of expediency. Secondly, that he requires we should
have an eye to the expediency also of the things we do, not resting upon their
lawfulness alone. And thirdly, that he measures the expediency of lawful
things by their usefulness unto edification. Of which in their order.

3. And first, Expediency in S. Paul's method supposes lawfulness. He takes
that for granted, that the thing is lawful, before he enter into any enquiry
whether it be expedient, yea or no. For expediency is here brought in, as a
thing that must restrain and limit us in the exercise of that liberty, which
God has otherwise allowed liberty unto unlawful things. And this Observation
is of right good use: for thence it will follow, that when the unlawfulness of
any thing is once made sufficiently to appear, all farther enquiry into the
expediency or inexpediency thereof, must thenceforth utterly cease and
determine. No conjuncture of circumstances whatsoever, can make that expedient
to be done at any time, that is of it self and in the kind (...). Euripid.
Phaeniss. Act. 3.
unlawful. For a man to blaspheme the holy Name of God, to sacrifice to idols,
to give wrong sentence in judgment, by his power to oppress those that are
not able to withstand him, by subtilty to overreach others in bargaining, take
up arms (offensive or defensive) against a lawful Sovereign: none of all
these, and sundry other things of like nature, being all of them simply and de
toto genere unlawful, may be done by any man, at any time, in any case, upon
any color or pretension whatsoever; the express command of God himself only
excepted, as in the case of Abraham for sacrificing his son. Genesis 22.2.
Not for the avoiding of scandal; not at the instance of any friend, or command
of power upon earth; not for the maintenance of the lives or liberties either
of our selves or others; not for the defense of Religion; not for the
preservation of a Church or State: no nor yet, if that could be imagined
possible, for the salvation of a soul, no nor for the redemption of the whole
world.

Popes, (but who the man was, and what the particular occasion, I cannot now
recall to mind,) that having in a consultation with some of his Cardinals,
proposed unto them the course himself had thought of, for the settling of some
present affairs to his most advantage: when one of the Cardinals told him he
might not go that way, because it was not according to justice; he made answer
again, that though it might not be done per viam justitiae, yet it was to be
done per viam expedientiae. A distinction which it seems the High Priest of
Rome had learned of his predecessor at Jerusalem, the High Priest Caiaphas, in
a solemn consultation held there John 11. John 11.47. -- 50.
There the a Council; and the business was, what they should do with Jesus. If
they should let him alone so, the people would all run after him because of his
miracles: and then would the Romans, (who did but wait for such an
opportunity,) make that a pretense to invade their country, and to destroy
both their religion and nation. If they should take away his life, that were
indeed a sure course: but Nicodemus had stammered them all for that a good
while before, in a former Council at Jerusalem, John 7.51.
John 7. when he told them that they could not do it by law; being they had
nothing to lay to his charge, that could touch his life. Up stands Caiaphas
then, and tells them, they were but too scrupulous to stand so much upon the
nice point of legality at that time: they should let the matter of justice go
for once, and consider what was now expedient to be done, for the preserving of
their nation, and to prevent the incursions of the Romans. (You know nothing at
all, says he, nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should
die for the people; and that the whole nation perish not.)

5. What ever infallibility either of these Highpriests might challenge to
themselves, or their flatterers ascribe to them: it is sure far safer for us to
rest our judgments upon that never-failing Rule of Paul Romans 3. ( Romans 3.8.
Nunquam virtus vitio adjuvanda est. Senec. 1. de ira. 9.
We may not do evil, that good may come thereof,) then to follow them in their
wild resolutions. But if we desire examples rather: we cannot have for the
purpose in one man, a more proper example on the one side for our imitation,
nor a more fearful example on the other side for our admonition; then are those
two so unlike actions of David in the matter of Saul, and in the matter of
Vriah.

6. As for Saul, two several times it was in the power of his hands to have
slain him, if he would. In the Cave, he might as easily have cut the thread of
his life, as the skirt of his garment: 1 Samuel 24.4.
and in the trench as easily have taken his head from off his shoulders, 1 Samuel
26.12.
as the spear expediency of it too. Saul was his professed, his implacable
enemy; 1 Samuel 26.20.
hunted him from place to place like a Partridge upon the mountains, set snares
and traps for him in every corner to destroy him; and all this without cause.
Nor was David ignorant of what God had promised, and Samuel had foretold,
concerning the rending Saul, and settling it upon him: and now if ever, might
seem to be a fair opportunity to bring all that about; now he had him in his
hands. By taking away his life, and setting the Crown upon his own head:
besides the accomplishment of Gods promises, he might so provide for his own
safety, quiet the distractions in the state, turn all the forces against the
common enemy; advance religion, in adding honorable solemnities to the public
worship; and settle the kingdom in a more just, moderate, and peaceable
government, then now it was. Plausible inducements all, 1 Samuel 24.4 and 26.8.
and probable: and his captains and servants about him did urge them, and to
press the expediency. But David rightly apprehended, the thing it self, to
offer violence to the Lords anointed, to be utterly unlawful: and that was it
that staid his hand. That unlawfulness alone he opposes against all these, and
whatsoever other seeming expediencies could be pretended, as a sufficient
answer to them all. The Lord forbid, that I should stretch forth my hand
against the Lords Anointed: 1 Samuel 24.6. 1 Samuel 26.9.
and, who can stretch out his hand against the Lords Anointed, and be
guiltless? This is David in the matter of Saul: a worthy example for our
Imitation.

7. See him now another while in the matter of Uriah, and how he behaved
himself there. Quantum mutatus! Could you think it were the same man? He had
layen with the wife, when the husband was abroad, 2 Samuel 11.4. -- Ibid. 5.
and in his service: and she proved with child. the Kings dishonor; ey, and to
the scandal of Religion too. It seemed therefore very expedient, the matter
should be smothered: and David sets all his wits on work how to do that
handsomely. Many fetches and devises he had in his head, and sundry of them he
put to trial, this way and that way: but none of them would take. God meant
him a shame for his sin; and therefore blasted all those his attempts, and made
them unsuccessful. When he saw he could not bring his purpose to pass any other
way, at last he entertaineth black thoughts, and falls upon a desperate
resolution; Uriah, must dye: so shall the widow be his; and the Child born in
lawful wedlock be thought to be legitimate, and all shall be well. A hard case,
to take away the life of an innocent person, a man of renown, valiant and
religious, 2 Samuel 23.39.
whose name stood in the list, enrolled among his chiefest worthies; 2 Samuel
11.13. -- Ibid. 25.
and that in a most base and treacherous fashion too, not without a great deal
of dawbing and hypocrisy withal: David's heart, that was so ready to smite him
at other times upon very small occasions in comparison, 1 Samuel 24.5.
would now buffet him with stronger checks; and not suffer him to be ignorant
of the wickedness and unlawfulness of his foul intentions. But all is one for
that: Iacta est alea. He was in, and he must on: so it must be now, thinks
he, or else we are shamed for ever. This is David in the matter of Uriah: a
fearful example for our Admonition.

8. Heaven and Hell are not at more distance, nor light and darkness more
unlike; then David's carriage in the one case, and in the other. Of which so
great difference and unlikeness if we examine what was the true cause, we shall
find it to have bin none other but this, that in the former he looked chiefly
at the unlawfulness of the thing, and in the later at the expediency only. In
the matter of Saul, he saw the thing was utterly unlawful to be done, as being
repugnant to the ordinance of God, and the duty of a subject; expedient or
inexpedient, he resolves he will not do it for a world: and that was certainly
the right way. In the matter of Uriah, he saw the thing was expedient to be
done, as conducing to his ends, for the saving of his credit at that time; and
therefore lawful or unlawful, he resolves he will do it, whatsoever come of
it: and that was certainly the wrong way.

9. Take we warning by his example, (it is the cheapest learning, to profit by
another harm,) not -- facere aliquid, quod scias non licere. Cic. pro Balbo.
to adventure the doing of any thing that we know to be unlawful; seem it never
so expedient, and conducible to such ends as we intend. Alas! why should any of
us bellies, cast the Commandments of God behind our backs? or violate his holy
laws, Romans 16.18. Psalm. 50.17.
to satisfy our own impure lusts? Can the compassing of any thing we can
desire in this world; profit, pleasure, preferment, glory, revenge, or any
thing else, be to us of so great advantage: that for the attainment thereof, we
should so far dishonor God, and quench the light that is in us; as to lie, and
forswear, and flatter, and slander, and supplant, and cheat, and oppress, or do
any other unjust or unlawful act, against the light of our own reason, or
contrary to the checks of our own consciences?

10. Nor ought we to be careful hereof then only, when in our selves, and our
own private conveniences in any of the forementioned respects of profit,
pleasure, and the rest: but even then also when our intentions are more noble
and honorable; the honor of God, the edification of our brethren, the peace
of the Church, and the common good. For neither pious intentions alone, nor
reasons of expediency alone, nor yet both together, will either warrant us
before hand to the choice, nor excuse us afterward for the use of unlawful
means. 1 Samuel 15.15.
What ever Saul's intention was, in sparing the fatter cattle, I make no
question but that Vzzah's very intention was pious, 2 Samuel 6.6.
in reaching forth his hand the Arc from falling, when it tottered in the
cart. The things themselves, both the one and the other, seemed to be very
expedient. But Gods special command to Saul that all should be destroyed, 1 Samuel
15.3. Numb. 4.25.
and his law given by Moses concerning that sacred and mysterious utensil,
having made both those things unlawful, did thereby also make both the facts
inexcusable: and Almighty God the disobedience of the one, and the rash
presumption of the other.

11. Be our ends and aims therefore what they will; unless we arm our selves
with strong resolutions beforehand, not to do any thing we know to be unlawful
upon any terms, seem it otherwise, never so expedient; and then afterward use
all our best prayers and endeavors by Gods grace to hold our resolutions: We
are gone. Satan is cunning, and we but weak: and he will be too hard for us, if
he do but find us any whit staggering in our resolutions, for doing lawful; or
lending an ear to any persuasions, for the doing of any thing that is unlawful.
By this very means he got within our Grandmother Eve; and prevailed with her to
taste of the forbidden fruit, though it were unlawful, by persuading her that
it was expedient. Genesis 3.5.
This once is a sure ground for us to build upon: to a good Christian, that
desires to make conscience of his ways, nothing can be truly Quicquid non
licet, certe non oportet, Cicer. pro Balbo.

Potest aliquid licere, and non expedire: expedire autem, quod non licet, non
potest. August. de adult. conjug. cap. 15. Constat in Christiana philosophia,
non decere nisi quod licet, nec expedire, nisi quod and decet and licet.

Bernard. de consid. lib. 3. Sin ii sumus, qui profecto esse debemus, ut nihil
arbitremur expedire, nisi quod rectum honestumque fit -- Cic. 4. fam. Epist. 3.


expedient, that is apparently unlawful. And so much for the first Observation.

12. The Apostle first supposes the thing to be lawful: else it may not be
done howsoever. But if it be lawful, then we hope we may use it at our
pleasure; without either scruple in our selves, or blame from others: Indeed
that is the common guise of the World. Have but the opinion of some Divine of
note, concerning any thing we have a mind to, that it is lawful: and then we
think we need take no more care, nor trouble our selves about circumstances.
But there is a great deal more belongs to it, then so. Lawfulness alone will
not bear us out in the use of a thing, unless there be care had withal to use
it lawfully: lest otherwise our liberty degenerate into a carnal
licentiousness; as easily it may do. For preventing whereof, the Apostle here
requires, that we consider as expedient to be done, as what is lawful. Which
was our second Observation. [All things are lawful for me, but all things are
not expedient.]

13. S. Bernard to Eugenius requires trinam considerationem, a threefold
consideration or enquiry to precede the doing of any action of moment, and
worthy our deliberation: An liceat, An deceat, An expediat. Whether it be
lawful or no; whether comely or no; whether expedient or no: lawful in it self,
comely for us, expedient in respect of others. He makes there that of decency,
and that of expediency, two different considerations the one from the
difference that is between them, as the necessity of both, arises from those
two grand virtues, which must have a special influence into every action
morally and spiritually good; to wit, Discretion and Charity: of which two
Discretion is the proper judge of decency, and Charity of expediency, decency,
it may be the Apostle intended not to speak of it at all: as being not so very
pertinent to his present argument; and having besides a purpose to mention it
more seasonably afterward. Or if he did; Chap 11. and 14.
he then takes expediency in a larger sense: so as to comprehend under that
name, all that which Bernard means by decency and expediency both. And so
taken, (that we may understand what it is we speak of,) the difference that is
between lawfulness and expediency consists in this: that lawfulness looks
but at the nature and quality of the thing in it self, considered in the kind,
and abstractedly both from the end and circumstances: but expediency takes in
the end also, and such other circumstances, as attend particular actions.

14. That expediency ever relates to the end, we may gather from the very
notion of the words. (...) in the Greek, is as much as to confer or contribute
something; to bring in some help or furtherance toward the attainment of the
desired end. And Expedire in the Latin, is properly to speed a business: as the
contrary thereof ( Impedire) is to hinder it. The word Expedition comes
thence: and so does this also of expediency. That thing then may expedient to
any end; that does expedire, give any furtherance or avail toward the
attaining of that end: and that on the contrary to be inexpedient, that does
impedire, cast in any let, rub, or impediment to hinder the same. It must be a
man's first care to propose to himself in all his actions some right end: and
then he is to judge of the expediency of the means by their serviceableness
thereunto.

15. It is (no doubt) lawful for a Christian, (being that God has tied him to
live out his time in the world,) therefore to propose to himself in sundry
particular actions of this life worldly ends; (gain, preferment, reputation,
delight:) so as he desire nothing but meet for him; and that his desires
thereof be also moderate. And he may consequently apply himself to such means,
as are expedient, and conducing to those ends. But those ends and means are but
the Bye of a Christian, not the Main. He lives in the World; and so must, and
therefore also may use it: But woe unto him, if he have not far higher and
nobler ends then these, to which all his actions must refer, and whereto all
those worldly both means and ends must be subordinate. And those are to seek
the glory of God, and the salvation of his own soul, by discharging a good
conscience, and advancing common good. In the use therefore and choice of such
things, as are in themselves lawful, (as all indifferent things are,) we are to
judge those means, that may any way further us toward the attainment of any of
those ends, to be so far forth expedient; and those that any way hinder the
same, to be so far forth inexpedient: and by how much more or less they so
either further or hinder, to be by so much more or less either expedient, or
inexpedient.

16. Besides the End, the reason of Expediency depends also very much upon
such other particular circumstances, as do attend humane actions: as times,
places, persons, measure, manner, and the rest. By reason of the infinite
variety and uncertainty whereof, it is utterly impossible to give such general
rules of Expediency, as shall serve to all particular cases: so that there is
no remedy, but the weighing of particular circumstances in particular actions,
must be left to (...). Arist. 2. Ethic. 6.
the discretion and charity of particular men. Wherein every man that desires
to walk conscionably, must endeavor wisdom and charity wherewith God has
endowed him, to resolve ever to do that, which seems to him most convenient
to be done, -- utra sit harum via utilior, cum materia deliberabimus. Quint. 3.
instit. 7. Consilium in arena. Adag.
as things then stand. Only let him be sure that still his eye and aim be upon
the right end in the main, and that then all things be ordered with reference
thereunto.

17. This discovery of the nature of Expediency, what it is; and what
dependence it has upon, and relation unto, the End and Circumstances of men's
actions: discovers unto us withal sundry lawfulness and expediency; and
thence also the very true reason, why in the exercise of our Christian liberty
it should be needful for us to have regard, as well to the Expediency, as to
the lawfulness of those things we are to do. Some of those differences are;
First, that as the natures of things are unchangable, but their ends and
circumstances various and variable: so their lawfulness, which is rooted in
their nature, is also constant and permanent and ever the same; but their
Expediency, which hangs upon so many Quorum usus coercetur certis
circumstantiis, ea dicuntur non expedire, non dicuntur non licere. Chamier. 3.
paustrat. 21.75.
turning hinges, is ever and anon changing. What is expedient to day, may be
inexpedient to morrow: lawful, and ever lawful. Secondly, that a thing may be
at the same time expedient in one respect, and inexpedient in another: but no
respects can make the same thing to be at once both lawful, and unlawful.
Because respects cannot alter the natures of things, from which their
lawfulness or unlawfulness arises. Thirdly, that the lawfulness and
unlawfulness of things consists in puncto indivisibili, (as they use to
speak,) even as the nature and essence of every thing does; and so are not
capable either of them of the degrees of more or less: all lawful things being
equally lawful, and all unlawful things equally unlawful. But there is a
latitude of expediency suscipere magis and minus: so as one thing may be more
or less expedient then another, and more or less inexpedient then another. And
that therefore fourthly, is is a harder thing to judge rightly of Quid rectum
sit, apparet: quid expediat, obscurum est. Cic. 5. ep. 19.
the Expediency of things to be done, then of their lawfulness. For to judge
whether a thing lawful or no, there need no more be done, but to consider the
nature of it in general, and therein what conformity it has with the
principles of reason, and the written word of God: And universalia certioria; a
man of competent judgment, and not fore-stalled with prejudice, will not
easily mistake in such generalities, because they are neither many, nor subject
to much uncertainty. But (...). Arist. 1. Poster. anal. 13.15.
descendendo contingit errare; the more we descend to particulars, in the more
danger are we of being mistaken therein: because we have both far more things
to consider of, and those also far more uncertain, then before. And it may fall
out, and not circumstance with another as carefully as we could; and thereupon
have resolved to do this or that as in our judgment the most expedient for that
time: some circumstance or other may come into our minds afterward, which we
did not fore-think, or some casual intervening accident may happen, which we
could not foresee; that may turn the scales quite the other way, and render the
thing, which seemed expedient but now, now altogether inexpedient.

18. From these and other like differences, we may gather the true reason, why
the Apostle so much and so often presses the Expediency, as meet to be taken
into our consideration and practice, as well as that of lawfulness. Even
because things lawful in themselves, and in the kind, may for want of -- etsi
officio videtur bonum, ipso non recto fine peccatum est. Augustine. 4. contra
Julian. 3.
a right End, or through neglect of due Circumstances, become sinful in the
doer. Not as if any act of ours could change the nature of the things from what
they are: for it is beyond the power of any creature in the world to do that.
God only is dominus naturae: to him it belongs only as chief Lord, to change
either the physical or moral nature of things at his pleasure. Things in their
own nature indifferent, God by commanding, can make necessary; and by
forbidding, unlawful: as he made circumcision necessary, and eating of porke
unlawful to the Jews under the old Law. But no scruple of conscience, no
command of the higher powers, no opinions either consent of men, no scandal or
abuse whatsoever, can make any indifferent thing to become either necessary or
unlawful, universally, and perpetually, and in the nature of it: but it still
remains indifferent as it was before, any act of ours notwithstanding. Yet
may such an indifferent thing, remaining still in the nature of it indifferent
as before, by some act of ours or otherwise, become in the use of it and by
accident, either necessary or unlawful pro hic and nunc, to some men, and at
some times, and with some circumstances. As command of lawful authority, may
make an indifferent thing, to us necessary for the time: and the just fear of
scandal may make an indifferent thing, to us unlawful for the time. Therefore
it behooves us in all our deliberations de rebus agendis, to consider well not
only of the nature of the thing we would do, whether it be lawful or no in the
kind; but of the end also, and all present circumstances, especially the most
material: lest, through some default there, it become so inexpedient, that it
cannot be then done by us without sin. For as we may sin, by doing that which
is unlawful: so may we also by doing even that, which is lawful in an undue
manner.

19. And it will much concern us, to use all possible circumspection herein,
the rather for two great reasons: for that by this means, (I mean the supposed
lawfulness of things) we are both very easily drawn on unto sin; and when we
are in, very hardly fetched off again. First, we are easily drawn on. The very
name and opinion lawfulness many times carries us along, whilst we suspect no
evil, and puts our foot into the snare, ere we be aware of it. The
conscience of many a good man, that would keep a strait watch over himself
against grosser offenses, will sometimes set it self very loose, when he
finds himself able to plead, that he does nothing but what is lawful. In
things simply evil sin cannot lurk so close, Eccles. 2.14.
but that a godly wise man that has his eyes in his head, may spy it and avoid
it: as a wilde-beast or thief may easily be descried in the open champain. But
if it can once shroud it self under the covert of lawfulness, it is the more
dangerous: like a wilde-beast or thief our danger is, the greater should be our
circumspection also.

20. And as we are easily inveigled and drawn in, to sins of this kind: so
when we are in, we get off again very hardly. If we chance through humane
frailty, or the strength of temptations, to fall into some gross offense, by
doing something that is manifestly unlawful, (although such gross sins are of
themselves apt to waste the conscience, to beat back the offers of grace, and
to harden the heart repentance for such sins, then when we transgress by
abusing our liberty in lawful things. 1. It is no hard matter to convince our
understandings of those grosser transgressions; their obliquity is so palpable.
2. They often lie cold and heavy at the heart: where the burden of them is so
pressing and afflictive, that it will force us to seek abroad for ease. 3. We
shall scarce read a Chapter, or hear a Sermon, but we shall meet with something
or other that seems to rub upon that gaul. 4. The World will cry shame on us,
5. and our enemies triumph, friends will have a just occasion to give us a
sharp rebuke: 7. And the guiltiness of the fact will so stop our mouths, that
we shall have nothing to answer for our selves. All which may be so many good
preparations unto repentance.

lawfulness in the substance of the thing done: 1. Seldom do we take notice of
our failings in some circumstances. 2. Nor do our hearts smite us with much
remorse thereat. 3. The edge of Gods holy Word slideth over us, without cutting
or piercing at all, or not deep. 4. We lie not so open to the upbraidings
either of friends or foes, but that if any thing be objected by either, we can
yet say something in our own defense. All which are so many impediments unto
repentance. Not but that who ever truly fears God, and repents unfainedly,
repents even of the smallest sins, as well as of the greatest: but that he
does it not so feelingly, nor so particularly, for these smaller, as for those
apprehensive of these, as he is of those. For the most part his repentance for
such like sins is but in a general form; wrapped up in the lump of his unknown
sins: Psalm. 19.12.
like that in Psalm. 19. Who can tell how often he offends? O cleanse thou me
from my secret faults! Only our hope and comfort is, that our merciful Lord
God will graciously accept this general repentance for current; without
requiring of us a more particular sense of those sins, whereof he has not
given us a more particular sight.

22. By what has been said you may perceive how unsafe a thing it is to rest
upon the bare lawfulness of a thing alone, without expediency. For this is
indeed the ready way to turn our liberty into a licentiousness: since even
lawful things become unlawful, when they grow inexpedient. Lawful in
themselves, but unlawful to us: lawful in their nature, but unlawful in their
use. But then the question will be, how we shall know from time to time, and at
all times, what is expedient to be done, and what not? Which leads us to the
third and last Observation from the Text, viz. That the expediency of lawful
things is to be measured by their usefulness unto edification. For if we shall
ask, Why are not all lawful things always expedient? the Apostles answer is,
Because they edify. When they do edify, they are not only lawful, but
expedient too; and we may do them: But when they edify not, but destroy,
though they be lawful still, yet are they not expedient; and we may not do
them. All things are lawful; but all things edify not.

23. To this edification it appears S. Paul had a great respect, in all his
actions and affairs: ( We do all things brethren, for your edifying, 2 Cor. 12.
2 Cor. 12.19.
) And he desires that all other men would do so too; ( Let every man please
his neighbor for his good unto edification, Romans 15.2.
Romans 15.2.) and that in all the actions of their lives, ( Let all things 1
Cor. 14. 1 Cor. 14.26.
) It is the very end for which God ordained the ministry of the Gospel; ( the
edifying of the body of Christ, Ephesians. 4.12.
Ephesians. 4.) and for which he endowed his servants with power and with gifts to
enable them for the work; ( the power which God has given us for edification,
2 Cor. 13.) Whatsoever our callings are, 2 Cor. 10.8. and 13.10.
whatsoever our power or gifts: if we direct them not to Edification,

24. But then what is Edification? for that we are yet to learn. The word is
metaphorical, taken from material buildings: but is often used by our Apostle
in his Epistles, with application ever to the Church of God, and the spiritual
building thereof. The Church, is the house of the living God. All Christians,
members of this Church, 1 Timothy 3.15.
are as so many stones of the building, whereof the house is made up. The
bringing in of unbeleevers into the Church, by converting them to the Christian
faith, is as the fetching of more stones from the quarries, to be laid in the
building. The building Edification,) is the well and orderly joining together
of Christian men, as living stones, in truth and love; that they may grow
together (as it were) into one entire frame of building, 1 Pet. 2.5.
to make up the house strong and comely for the masters use and honor.

25. I know not how it is come to pass in these later times, that in the
popular and common notion of this word in the mouths and apprehensions of most
men generally, Edification is in a manner confined wholly to the Understanding.
Which is an error, perhaps not of much consequence; yet an error tho, and
such as has done some hurt too. For thereon is grounded that Objection, which
some have stood much upon, (though there be little cause why,) against
instrumental music in the service of God, and some edification, but rather
hinder it, because there comes no instruction, nor other fruit to the
understanding thereby: And therefore ought such things, say they, to be cast
out of the Church, as things unlawful. A conclusion (by the way,) which will by
no means follow, though all the premises should be granted: for it is clear
both from the words and drift of the Text, that Edification is put as a meet
(...) indeed of Expediency, but not so of lawfulness: And therefore from the
unserviceableness of any thing to Edification, we cannot reasonably infer the
unlawfulness thereof, but the Inexpediency the premises, and laid as the ground
of the objection, (viz. that where the understanding is not benefited, there is
no Edification;) is not true. The objecters should consider, that whatsoever
thing any way advances the service of God, or furthereth the grouth of his
Church; or conduces to the increasing of any spiritual grace, or enliving of
any holy affection in us; or serves to exercise, or but expression of any such
grace or affection, as joy, fear, thankfulness, cheerfulness, reverence, or
any other; doubtless every such thing so far forth serves more or less unto
Edification.

building up of the people in the right knowledge of God, and of his most holy
truth, is I confess a necessary part of the work; and no man that wishes well
to the work, will either despise it in his heart, or speak contemptibly of it
with his mouth: yet is it not the whole work tho, no nor yet the chiefest part
thereof. Our Apostle expressly gives charity the pre-eminence before it:
knowledge puffs up, but charity edifieth. 1 Cor. 8.1.
And for once he speaks of Edification in his Epistles with reference to
knowledge; I dare say he speaks of it thrice with reference to peace and
brotherly Charity or condescension. The truth is, that Edification he so much
truth, godliness, and peace, or any grace accompanying salvation, for the
common good of the whole body. S. Jude speaks of building up our selves; and
S. Paul of edifying one another. Jude ver. 20. ^ These. 5.11.
And this should be our daily and mutual study, to build up our selves and
others in the knowledge of the truth, and in the practice of godliness: but
especially to the utmost of our powers, within our several spears, and in
those stations wherein God has set us, to advance the common good, by
preserving peace and love and unity in the Church.

27. The instructions, corrections, or admonitions we bestow upon private
brethren; the good examples we set before them; our bearing with their
infirmities; our yielding and condescending from our own power and liberty, to
the desires even of private and particular men: is as the chipping and hewing,
and squaring of the several stones, to make them fitter for the building. But
when we do withal promote the public good of the Church, and do something
toward the procuring and conserving the peace and unity thereof, according to
our measure: that is, as the laying of the stones together, by making them
cowch close one to another, and binding them with sillings and cyment, to make
them hold. the times, places, and persons with whom we have to do, to conduce
to the good either of the whole Church, or of any greater or lesser portion
thereof, or but of any single member belonging thereunto, (so as no prejudice,
or wrong be thereby done to any other:) that we may be sure is expedient for
that time.

28. To enter into particulars, when and how far forth we are bound to forbear
the exercise of our lawful liberty in indifferent things for our brothers sake,
would be endless. When all is said and written in this argument that can be
thought of; yet Discretion and Charity. Discretion first will tell us in the
general, that as the Circumstances alter, so the expediency and inexpedieny of
things may alter accordingly. Senec. 9. controv. 2. Eccles. 3.1.
Quaedam quae licent, tempore and loco mutato non licent, says Seneca. There
is a time for every thing, says Solomon, and a season for every purpose under
heaven. Momentis quaedam grata et ingrata sunt. Senec. 1. de benef. 12.

should now in these times endeavor to bring back into the Church postliminio,
and after so many years cessation thereof, either the severity of the ancient
Canons for public penances, or the enjoining of private confessions
inexpediency. Not in regard of the things themselves, Acts 16.3. Gal. 2.3. -- 5
which (severed from those abuses which in tract of time had through men's
corruption grown thereunto) are certainly lawful; and might be, as in some
former times, so now also profitable, if the times would bear them. But in
regard of Quaedam justa natura, sed condition te^porum inutilia. Quintil. 12.1.
the condition of the times, and the general aversness of men's minds
therefrom: who having been so long accustomed to so much indulgence and liberty
in that kind, could not now brook those severer impositions* but would cry out
against them, (as they do against some Antichristian and superstitious. Paul
thought fit to circumcise Timothy at one time, when he saw it expedient so to
do: but would by no means yield that Titus should be circumcised at another
time, when he saw it inexpedient.

make our own, and others, and the common good. Nothing doubting, but that if
so we do, we shall do that that is expedient; although possibly we may see some
inconveniences likely to ensue thereupon. For if we shall suspend our
resolutions, till we can bethink our selves of something that is free from all
inconveniences; in most of our deliberations we shall never resolve upon any
thing at all: as Solomon says, Eccles. 11.4 Rusticus expectat dum defluat

Arist. 3. Top. 2.1.
the least and fewest, we shall not have much cause to repent us of our choice.
And all this our Discretion will teach us.

30. Charity also will tell us in the general, that we must bear with the
weakness of our brethren, and forbear our own liberty in some cases; where we
may see hope that any good will come of stones in a building, if they be well
laid together, do give mutual strength and support one to another: so it is
our duty to bear one another burdens, that so we may fulfill the law of Christ.
Gal. 6.2. 1 Cor. 13.5.
Charity seeks not her own, 1 Cor. 13. She stands not ever upon the tip-to,
with those high terms, [ This I may do, and this I will do, whosoever says
nay. I may eat flesh, and I will eat flesh, take offense at it who list:] but
where she may hope to do good, comes down so low, 1 Cor. 8.13.
as to resolve never to eat flesh while the world stands, rather then give
offense thereby. Our Apostle professes in the last verse of this Chapter, that
he sought to please all men in all things, not seeking his own profit, but the
profit of many. And it was no flourish neither: S. Paul was a real man, no
bragger: what he said, he did. 1 Cor. 9.20. -- 22.
He became as a Jew to the Jews, as a Gentile to the Gentiles; not to humor
either, but to win both. And at Corinth he maintained himself a long while
together with his own hand-labour, when he might have challenged maintenance
from them, as the Apostles of Christ: 2 Cor. 11.12.
only to cut off occasion from those that standered him, as if he went about to
make a prey of them, and would have bin glad to find any occasion against him,
to give credit to that slander.

31. But what is S. Paul now all on a sudden become a man-pleaser? Or how is
there not yea and nay with him; that he should here profess it so largely; 2
Cor. 1.18.
and yet elsewhere protest against it so deeply. Gal. 1.10.
Do I seek to please men? No, says he, I scorn it: such baseness will better
become their own slaves; I am the servant of Christ. Gal. 1. Worthy resolutions
both; both savouring an Apostolic spirit: and no contrariety at all between
them. Rather that seeming contrariety yields excellent instruction to us, how
to behave our selves in this matter of pleasing. Not to please men, be they
never so many or great, out of flatness of spirit: so as for the pleasing of
them, either first to neglect any part of our duty toward God and Christ; or
secondly to go against our own consciences, by doing any dishonest or unlawful
thing; or thirdly, to do them harm whom we would please, by confirming them in
their errors, flattering them in their sins, humouring them in their
peevishness, or but even cherishing their weakness: (for weakness though it
may be born with, yet it must not be cherished.) to please any man. But then by
yielding to their infirmities for a time, in hope to win them; by patiently
expecting their conversion or strengthening; Romans 15.1.
by restoring them with the spirit of meekness, 1 These. 5.14. Gal. 6.1.
when they had fallen; by forbearing all scornful, jeering, provoking, or
exasperating language and behavior toward them; Gal. 5.2^. 2 Timothy 2 25.
but rather with meekness instructing them that opposed themselves: so did he,
so should we seek to please all men; 1 Cor. 10.33. Romans 15.2.
for their profit, and for their good. For that is charity.

32. Alas, it is not the pleasing, or displeasing of men, that Charity looks
after, but their good: And therefore as it seeks to please them, if that be
for their good; so it cares not to displease them, if that also be for their
good. S. Paul was ad utrumque paratus; he could use both, as occasion required,
either the rod, or the spirit of meekness: 1 Cor. 4.21.
and he would make choice ever of that, which he saw to be for the present the
more expedient. He was a wise Master Builder; 1 Cor. 3.10.
and knew how to lay his work, to make the building rise both fair and
strong. He took his model from the Arch-architect, the builder and maker of all
things, which is God. Heb. 3.4. Wisd. 8.1.
Suaviter and fortiter, in the book of wisdom: all Gods fortiter; effectually,
and without fail in respect of the end: that is to build strong: But yet
suaviter; sweetly, and without violence in the use of the means* that is to
build fair.

Governor, any Minister, any private man, that desires to do so much as
falls to his share in this Building, desire a better pattern to work by? A
Governor, that has advisedly resolved upon a just course, (for that must
still be supposed: if justice do not lie at the bottom, the frame cannot
stand;) let him go through-stitch with it in Gods name; do it fortiter, (as is
said of David, Psalm. 78. He ruled them prudently with all his power:) so as
his commands may be obeyed, his authority feared, Psalm. 78.72.
his enemies quelled. But then he must do it suaviter too, (that must not be
forgotten,) with such equity, lenity, and moderation; that they justice and
clemency. A Minister also of the Gospel, who has a great part in the work,
both for the pulling down of error and sin, and for the setting up of truth
and godliness; Jer. 1.10.
he must do his part fortiter: instruct, exhort, reprove, correct, with full
demonstration of the spirit and power, and with clear evidence of truth and
reason; that he may build strong. 1 Cor. 2.4.
Yet suaviter too, with all sweetness and meekness, with much beseeching and
brotherly language, that he may build fair: approving himself both ways a
workman that needs not be ashamed. 2 Timothy 2.15.
But if he ill stuff, or lay it ill; that is, if either he prove with bad
arguments, or reprove with bad words: he may then be ashamed of his work; he
does but blunder and bungle, and not build. Yea, every private man, that has
in his hand the managing of any good cause, wherein he meets with opposition,
cannot give better proof both of his wisdom and charity, then by doing it
fortiter and suaviter; to the uttermost of his power and skill, effectually;
but fairly.

34. I have now done with all my three observations: and should draw to a
conclusion, but that for the preventing of a foul mistake one caution of some
importance; and it is this. That in weighing the decency, and expediency of
things, we ought to make a difference between those lawful things, wherein
superior authority has interposed, and determined our liberty either way; and
those things wherein we are left wholly to our selves. What has bin said
concerning the yielding to the weaknesses of our brethren for the avoiding of
their offense; and the forbearing of lawful things sometimes, when they grow
inexpedient: is to be understood of such things only, as are wholly in our own
power; no superior authority, either divine or humane, having limited us
therein. But where lawful authority has determined determination, any seeming
inexpediency to the contrary notwithstanding.

35. Whiles things are in agitation; private men may, if any thing seem to them
inexpedient, modestly tender their thoughts, together with the reasons thereof,
to the consideration of those that are in authority: to whose care and wisdom
it belongs, in indifferent things, to proceed with all just advisedness and
moderation: that so the subject may be encouraged to perform that Remissius
imperanti, melius paretur, Senec. 1. de Clem. 24.
obedience with cheerfulness, which of necessity he must perform howsoever. It
concerns superiors therefore to look well to the expediency, and
inexpediency of what they enjoin in indifferent things. Wherein if there be a
fault, it must lie upon their account: the necessity of obedience is to us a
sufficient discharge in that behalf. Only it were good we did remember, that
(...) are to give up that account to God only, and not to us. But after that
things are once concluded and established acts passed and constitutions made
concerning the same, and the will and pleasure of the higher powers
sufficiently made known therein: then for private men to put in their vye, and
with unseasonable diligence to call in question the decency or expediency of
the things so established, yea with intolerable pride to refuse obedience
thereunto merely upon this pretension, that they are undecent or inexpedient;
is it self indeed the most indecent and inexpedient thing that can be imagined.

36. For that the fear of offending a private brother, is a thing not
considerable in comparison of the duty of obedience to a public might be
shown so apparently by sundry arguments, if we had time to enlarge and
illustrate them, as must sufficiently convince the judgment of any man not
wilfully obstinate, in that point. I shall only crave leave briefly to touch
at some of them. First then, when Governors shall have appointed what seemed
to them expedient; and private men shall refuse to observe the same, pretending
it to be inexpedient: who shall judge thereof? Either they themselves that take
the exceptions must be judges; which is both unreasonable and preposterous: or
else every man must be his own judge, which were to overthrow all government,
and to bring good in his own eyes: or else the known governors must judge;
Judge. 21.25.
and then you know what will follow, even to submit and obey.

37. Secondly, to allow men under the pretense of inexpediency, and because of
some offense that may be taken thereat, to disobey laws and constitutions made
by those that are in authority; were the next way to cut the sinews of all
authority, and to bring both Magistrates and Laws into contempt. For what law
ever was made, or can be made, so just and reasonable, but some man or other
either did, or might take offense thereat? disobey, but may pretend some
inexpediency or other, wherewith to countenance out such his disobedience?

38. Thirdly, It is agreed by consent of all that handle the matter of Scandal,
that we may not commit any sin whatsoever, be it small, for the avoiding of any
scandal, be it never so great. But to disobey lawful authority in lawful
things, is a sin against the fifth Commandment. Therefore we may not redeem a
scandal by such our disobedience; nor refuse to do the thing commanded by such
authority, whosoever should take offense thereat.

39. Fourthly, though lawfulness and unlawfulness be not, yet expediency and
inexpediency are (as we heard) capable of the degrees of more and less; and
then in all reason, of two inexpedient things, we are to do that which is (...)
Aristot. 5. Ethic. 2.

(...). Nazian. Orat. 40.


less inexpedient, for the avoiding of that which is more inexpedient. Say
then there be an inexpediency in doing the thing commanded by authority, when a
brother is thereby offended: is there not a greater inexpediency in not doing
it, when the Magistrate is thereby disobeyed? Is it not more expedient, and
conducing to the common good, that a public magistrate should be obeyed in a
just command, then that a private person should be gratified in a causeless
scruple?

40. Fifthly, when by refusing obedience to the lawful commands of our
Superiors, we think to shun the offending of one or two weak brethren; we do
in truth incur thereby a far Advertat, scandalum scandalo non been e^nendari.
Bernard. de praec. and disp.
more grievous scandal, by giving offense to hundreds of others: whose
consciences by our disobedience will be emboldned to that, whereto corrupt
despise authority.

41. Lastly, where we are not able to discharge both; Iustitiae officia sunt
priora, and strictioris obligationis, quam illa quae sunt charitatis. Ames. 2
Medul. Theol. 16.62.
debts of justice are to be paid, before debts of charity. Now the duty of
obedience is debitum justitiae, and a matter of right: my superior may
challenge it at my hands as his due; and I do him wrong, if I withold it from
him. But the care of not giving offense is but debitum charitatis, and a matter
but of courtesy. I am to perform it to my brother in love, when I see cause:
but he cannot challenge it from me as his right; nor can justly say I do him
wrong, if I neglect it. It is therefore no more lawful for me, to disobey the
lawful command of a Superior, to prevent thereby the offense of one or a few
brethren: then it is lawful for me to do one man Quis esi, qui dicat, ut
habeamus quod domus pauperibus, faciamus furta divitibus? August* cont mendac.
cap. 7.
wrong, to do another man a courtesy withal; or then it is lawful for me to
rob the Exchequer, to relieve an Hospital.

42. I see not yet how any of these six reasons can be fairly avoided: and yet,
(which would be considered,) if but any one of them hold good, it is enough to
carry the cause: And therefore I hope there need be no more said in this
matter. To conclude then, practice, (which is the main thing I aimed at in the
choice of this Text, and my whole meditations thereon,) we may take our
direction in these three Rules; easy to be understood and remembered, and not
hard to be observed in our practice, if we will but put our good wills
thereunto. First, if God command, we must Audactam existimo de bono praecepti
divini disputare. Tertul. de poenit. cap. 4. Genesis 22.
submit without any more ado; and not trouble expediency, or so much as about
the lawfulness of the thing commanded. His very Quia revolvis? Deus praecepit.
Tertul. Ibid.
command is warrant enough for both. Abraham never disputed whether it were
expedient for him, nor yet whether it were lawful for him to sacrifice his son
or no, when once it appeared to him, that God would have it so.

43. Secondly, if our Superiors, endued with lawful authority thereunto,
command us any thing; we may, and (where we have Vbi suspicio, ibi discussio
necessaria. Bern. Epist. 7.
just cause of doubt) we ought, to enquire into the lawfulness thereof. Yet not
with such anxious curiosity, as if we desired to find out some loope-hole
whereby to evade; but with such modest ingenuity, fear God, and to honor
those that he has set over us. 1 Pet. 2.17.
And if having used ordinary moral diligence bona fide to inform our selves
the best we can, there appear no unlawfulness in it; we are then also to --
ille vice Dei tibi dicit, quid expedit, et quid decet. Gers. de relig. per^.
pt. 3.
submit and obey without any more ado, never troubling our selves farther to
enquire whether it be expedient yea or no. Let them that command us look to
that: for it is they must answer for it, and not we.

44. But then thirdly, where authority has left us free; no command, either of
God, or of those that are set over us under liberty and choice, to do as we
shall think good. Yet are we not left so loose, as that we may do what we list,
so as the thing be but lawful; (for that were licentiousness, and not liberty:)
but we must ever do that, which according to the exigence of present
circumstances, (so far as all the wisdom and charity we have will serve us to
judge,) shall seem to us most expedient, and profitable to mutual Edification.
This is the way: God give us all grace to walk in it. So shall we bring glory
to him, and to our selves comfort: so shall we further his work onward, and
our own account at


WHITEHALL July 1641.
Romans 15.6. -- That ye may with one mind, and with one mouth


1. THe sense hangs unperfect, unless we take in the former verse too. Both
together contain a Votive Prayer or Benediction; wherewith the Apostle, for the
better speeding of all the pains he had taken in the whole former Chapter, and
in the beginning of this, (to make the more charitably affected one toward
another, without despising the weakness, Romans 14.3, 10.
or judging the liberty, one of another,) concludes his whole discourse
concerning that argument. His Exhortations will do the better, he thinks, if
he second them with his devotions; I have showed you, says he, what you are to
do: (...), Now God grant it may be done. Now the God of patience and of
consolation grant you to be like minded one toward another according to Christ
Jesus; That ye may with one, etc.

2. In the matter or substance of which prayer, (besides the formality thereof
in those first words, Now the God of patience and consolation grant you:) S.
Paul expresses, both the thing he desired; even their unity, in the residue of
the fifth verse [ to be like minded one toward another according to Christ
Jesus:] and the end for which he desired it; even Gods glory, in this sixth
verse [ That ye may with one mind, and with one mouth, glorify God, even the
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.] Of that I have heretofore spoken, now, some
this I desire by Gods grace presently to speak. And like as in that former part
we then considered three particulars: First, the thing it self, Unity or
like-mindedness [to be like-minded;] and then two amplifications thereof; one
in respect of the Persons, that it should be universal and mutual [one toward
another;] the other in the manner, that it should be [ according to Christ
Jesus:] So are we at this time, in this later part to consider of the like
three particulars. First, the end it self, the glory of God [ that ye may
glorify God.] And then two amplifications thereof: the one, respecting the
person whom they were to glorify; thus described [ God, ] the other respecting
the manner how, or the means whereby they were to glorify him [ with on^ mind
and with one mouth.] Of which in their order: the End first, and then the
amplifications.

(...), That ye may glorify God. We must a little search into the words, that
we may the more fully understand them. The first word (...), though but a
particle, has its use: it points us out to some end or final cause. Would S.
Paul have so bestirred himself as he does; spent so much breath, so much
oratory, so many arguments; been so copious and so earnest as he is, by his
best both persuasions and prayers, to draw all parts to unity: if he had not
conceived it conducible to some good end? He that does not propose to himself
some -- (...). Aristot. 1. Ethic. 1.
main end in all his actions, especially those that are of moment, and such as
he will make a business of; is not like either to go on with any good
certainty, or to come off with any sound comfort. There would be ever some fixed
end or other thought of, in all our undertakings and endeavors.

4. And so there is most an end; ( Nature it self prompting us thereunto:) but
for the most part ( our nature being so foully depraved) a wrong one. Phil. 2.21.
Omnes quae sua: he speaks of it complainingly, All seek their own; seldom
look beyond themselves: but make their own profit, their own pleasure, their
own glory, their own safety, or other their own personal contentment, the
utmost end of all their thoughts. Which upon the point is no better then very
Quis enim est bonus, qui facit nihil nisi sui causa? Cic. 7. epist. 12.
Atheism, or at the best (and that but a very little better) Idolatry. He that
does all for himself, and has no farther End: makes an Idol of himself, and
has no other God. [The ungodly is so proud, that he cares not for God,
neither is God in all his thoughts. Psalm 10. He is so full of himself, Psalm.
10.4.
his thoughts are so wholly taken up with himself, that there is no room there
for God, or any thing else but himself. But this self-seeking S. Paul every
where disclaimeth: not seeking his own profit, 1 Cor. 10. Nor counting his life
dear unto himself, 1 Cor. 10.33. Act. 20.24.
so as he might do God and his Church any acceptable service, either with it or
without it, Act. 20. If he had looked but at himself and his own things; what
needed the dissentions have troubled him any thing at all? If they be so
minded, let them go to it hardly; judge on, and despise on; Romans 14.3, 10. Gal.
5.15.
tugg it out among themselves as well as they can; bite and devour one another:
till they had wearied and worried one another: what is that to him? It would be
much more for his ease, and possibly he should have as much thanks from them
too, (for to part a fray is mostwhat a thankless office,) to sit him down, let
them alone, and say nothing. This is all true, and this he knew well enough
too. But there was a farther matter in it: Master had an interest; 1 These. 3.1,
5.
his honor suffered in their dissentions: and then he could not hold off.
(...) (as his phrase is twice in one Chapter, 2 Cor. 5.14.
) he could not for his life forbear, but he must put in: for the love of Christ
constrained him. We by his example to make God our chiefest good, and the
utmost end of all our actions and intentions. Not merely seeking our own
credit, or profit, or ease, or advancement; nor determining our aims in our
selves, or in any other creature: But raising our thoughts to an higher pitch,
to look beyond all these at God, as the chief delight of our hearts, and scope
of our desires; Psalm. 16.8.
That we may be able David Psalm. 16. I have set the Lord always before me. That
is a second Point.

5. And if we do so, the third will fall in of it self, to wit, his Glory; for
he, and it, are inseparable. The greatest glory on earth is than of a mighty
King, when he appears in state: his robes glorious, his attendants glorious,
every thing about him ordered to be as glorious as may be, ( Solomon in all his
glory. Mat. 6. Mat. 6.29.
) There is, I grant, no proportion here: ( finiti ad infinitum.) But because we
are acquainted with no higher; it is the best resemblance we have, whereby to
take some scantling of the infinite glory heavenly King. And therefore the
Scriptures fitted to our capacity, speak of it to us mostly in that key [ The
Lord is King, Psalm. 93.1. -- 104.1.
and has put on glorious apparel. Psalm 93. O Lord my God thou art become
exceeding glorious: thou art clothed with Majesty and honor. Psalm 104.) But
as I said before, it holds no proportion. So that we may not unfitly take up
our Apostles words elsewhere, (though spoken to another purpose;) Even that
which is most glorious here 2 Cor. 3.10. And the force of the argument he uses
at the next verse there, holds full out as strongly here: For, says he, if
that which is done away be glorious, much more that which remains is
glorious. The glory of the greatest Monarch in the world, when it is at the
fullest is but (...), ( the word fitteth the thing very well,) a matter rather
of show and opinion then of substance; and has in it more of fancy, then
reality: ((...), is S. Lukes expression Act. 25. Act. 25.23.
) Yet as empty a thing as it is: if it were of any permanency, it were worthy
the better regard. But that that makes verier vanity is, that it is a thing so
transitory: it shall and must be done away. But the glory of the great King of
heaven remains, and shall not (cannot) be done away for ever. The glorious
Majesty of the Lord endures for ever, Psalm. 104 31.
Psalm. 104. If then that be glorious, much more this: but how much more, is
more then any tongue can utter, or heart conceive. So that if we look at God,
we cannot leave out Glory.

6. Nither if we speak of Glory, may we leave our God: and that is a fourth
Point. For as no other thing belongs so properly to God, as Glory: so neither
does Glory belong so properly to any other person, as to God. The holy Martyr
S. Stephen therefore calls him The God of Glory. Act. 7.2.
And the holy Apostles, when they speak of giving him glory, Romans 16.7. 1 Timothy
1.17.
do it sometimes with the exclusive parcle or (as the words will equally bear
it) only to the wise God be glory: to him, and only to him. Yea and the holy
Angels in that Anthem they sang upon our Saviors birth, when they shared
heaven and earth their several portions, allotted us our part in peace, and
the good will of God, but with reservation of the whole glory to him. [ Glory
be to God on high, Luke 2.14.
and in earth peace, and toward men good will.] It is Tibi Domine, tibi maneat
gloria illibata: mecum been agitur, si pacem habuero. Bern. in Cant. ser. 13.
well and happy for us, if we may enjoy our own peace, and his good will, (full
little have we deserved either of both, but much rather the contrary,) but we
were best take heed how we meddle with his All other things he gives us richly
to enjoy; many a good gift and perfect giving. He has not withheld from us
any thing that was his, 1 Timothy 6.17.
and useful for us; no not his only begotten Son excepted: Jam. 1.17. Psalm.
84.12.
the best gift that ever was given, and a pledge of all the rest. Ey and he
will give us a kind of glory too; ( the Lord will give grace and glory, Psalm.
84.) and that not a light one neither, nor fading away: but such as neither
eye, nor ear, nor heart of man can comprehend; 2 Cor. 4 17.
an eternal and exceeding weight of glory.) But that divine, infinite,
incomprehensible glory, that belongs to him as supreme King of Kings, as his
peculiar Prerogative, and the choicest flower in his Crown: of that he is most
jealous; in that he will brook no sharer. And he has made Esaias 42. My glory
will I not give to another. Esaias 42.8.


7. He will part with none, you see: it seems rather fifthly, (by the form
of the verb (...)) that he looks for some from us. For what else is it to
glorify, but to make one glorious by conferring some glory upon him, which he
had not, (or not in that degree,) before. And to God how can that be done?
whose -- (...) etc. Naz. ^rat. 34.
glory is perfect, essential, and infinite: and to what is perfect, much less
to what is infinite, can nothing be added. What a Macrob. 1. Saturn. 24.
great admirer of Virgil said of him ( tanta Maronis gloria, ut) was but a
flaunting hyperbole, far beyond the merit of the party he meant it to. But the
like speech would be most exquisitely true of him, of whom we now speak;
(indeed a (...) rather then an hyperbole:) Whose Glory is truly such, as all
the creatures in the world, should they join their whole forces together to do
it, could not make it either more or less then it is.

8. We must therefore of necessity forsake the proper signification of the word
Glorify (which is to add some glory to another, either in specie or in gradu,
which before he had not:) and understand it in such a sense, as that the thing
meant thereby may be Dominum magnificat, qui domini magnificentiam praedicat.
Eusebius. Emiss. hom. 6. Psalm. 66.1.
to Glorify God, is no more then to show forth his glory: and to manifest to
our own consciences and to the world, how highly we prise and esteem his glory;
and how earnestly we desire and as much as in us lies endeavor it, that all
other men would also with us acknowledge and admire the same, Sing praise to
the honor of his name; make his praise to be glorious Psalm. 66. Not make his
essence to be more glorious then it is in it self: but make his praise to be
more and more glorious in the eye and esteem of men; That so his power, his
glory, -- 145.12.
and mightiness of his kingdom might be known unto men; and that men might
ascribe unto the Lord -- 96.8.
and that men might sing in the way of the Lord, that great is the glory of the
Lord. -- 138.5.
To endeavor by our thanksgivings, confessions, faith, charity, obedience,
good works, and perseverance in all these, to bring Gods true religion and
worship into request, to win a due reverence to his holy name and word, to
beget in others more high and honorable thoughts concerning God in all those
his most eminent attributes of Wisdom, Power, Justice, Mercy, and the rest:
that is in Scripture language to glorify God.

9. One thing more from the person of the Verb: and then that God may be
glorified; and so leave it indefinite, and uncertain by whom it should be done:
but (...), that ye may glorify him. The thing to be done: and they to do it.
One would think the glorious Angels and Saints in heaven were fitter
instruments for such an employment, then we poor sinful Worms upon earth. Very
true, they in heaven are there: but there is more need of it upon earth; and if
it be done here (in truth and singleness of heart,) it is very well accepted.
Poor things, God knows, our best services are, if God should value them but
according to their weight and worth. But in his mercy, (and that through
Christ,) he graciously accepts our unfeigned desires, and faithful endeavors,
according to that truth we have, be it never so little: and not according to
that perfection we want, be it never so much. Alas, what is the tinckling of
two little bells in a Countrey-steeple, or the peoples running to the
Towns-end, and crying God save the King; to the majesty of a potent Monarch?
Yet will a gracious Prince take those mean expressions of his subjects love, as
an honor done him: because he reads therein their hearty affections toward
him, and he knows, that if they knew how to express themselves better; they
would. So it is here: It is not the thing done, that is looked at so much, as
the heart. Set that right first: and then be the performance what it can be,
God is both pleased and honored therewithal. Who so offers praise glorifieth
me, Psalm. 50.23.
Psalm. 50. That is; so he intends it, and so I accept it.

10. You have now all I would say by way of explication, from these words. The
particulars are six. First we should propose Secondly, look at God: Thirdly,
that God may have glory: and that he alone may have it, Fourthly: Fifthly, that
something be done for the advancement of his glory: and Lastly, that it be done
by us. The result, from the whole six taken together is; That the glory of God
ought to be the chiefest end, and main scope, of all our desires and
endeavors. In what ever we think, say, do, or suffer in the whole course of
our lives and actions, we should refer all to this, look at this as the main.
Whatsoever become of us and our affairs, that yet God may be glorified. Whether
ye eat or drink, 1 Cor. 10.
says S. Paul, or whatsoever else ye do, let all be done to 1 Cor. 10. He
would have us, not only in the performance of good works and of necessary
duties, to intend the glory of God, Matthew. 5.16.
(according to that of our Savior, Let your light so shine before men, that
they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven:) but
even in the use of the Creatures, and of all indifferent things; in eating, and
drinking, in buying and selling, and in all the like actions of common life. In
that most absolute form of prayer, taught us by Christ himself as the pattern
and Canon of all our prayers, the glory of God stands at both ends. When we
begin, the first petition we are to put up, is, that the Name of God hallowed
and glorified: and when we have done, we are to wrap up all in the conclusion
with this acknowledgement, that to him alone belongs all the kingdom, the
power, and the glory for ever and ever.

The glory of God, you see, is to be the Alpha and the Omega of all our votes
and desires. Infinitely therefore to be preferred, not only before riches,
honors, pleasures, friends, and all the comforts and contentments the World
can afford us in this life, but even before life it self. The blessed Son of
God so valued it; who laid down his life for his Fathers glory: and so did many
holy Martyrs and faithful servants of God value it too* who laid down their
lives for their Masters glory. Nay, let me go yet higher: infinitely to be
preferred, even before the unspeakable joys of the life to come, before the
everlasting salvation of our own souls. It was not merely a strain of his
Rhetoric, to give his brethren (by hyperbolical expression,) the better
assurance of his exceeding great love toward them, that our Apostle said
before at Chap. 9. of this epistle, that he could wish himself to be accursed,
Romans 9.3.
to be made an Anathema, to be separated and cut off from Christ, for their
sakes. Neither yet was it a hasty inconsiderate speech, that fell suddenly from
him as he was writing ( fervente calamo;) and as the abortive fruit of a
precipitate over-passionate zeal, before he had sufficiently consulted his
reason, whether he should suffer it to pass in that form or not, for then
doubtless he would have corrected himself, and retracted it upon his second
thoughts; Acts 23.5.
as he did Acts 23. reviled the High Priest sitting then in the place of
judicature. But he spoke it advisedly, and upon good deliberation; yea and that
upon his conscience, ey and upon his Oath too, and as in the presence of God:
as you may see it ushered in there with a most solemn asseveration, as the true
real and earnest desire of his heart; I speak the truth in Christ, I lie not,
my conscience bearing me witness in the holy Ghost. Romans 9.1.
Not that S. Paul wished their salvation more then his own; (understand it not
so:) for such a desire neither was possible, nor could be regular. Not
possible, by the law of Nature, which cannot but begin at home ( Terent Andr.
(...). Se^ar. Graec.
Omnes sibi) Nor regular, by the course of Charity; which is not orderly, if it
do not so too. That is not it then, but this: That he preferred the glory of
God before both his own salvation, and theirs. In so much that, if Gods glory
should so require ( hoc imposibili supposito:) he could be content with all his
heart rather to lose his own part in the joys of heaven, that God might be the
more glorified; then that God should lose any part of his glory, for his
salvation.

12. And great reason there is, that as his was, so every Christian man's heart
should be disposed in like manner: that the bent desires and endeavors, (all
other things set apart, otherwise then as they serve thereunto) should be the
glory of God. For first, all men consent in this as an undoubted verity, That
that which is the chiefest good, ought also to be the uttermost end. And that
must needs be the chiefest good, which Almighty God (who is goodness it self,
and best knows what is good,) proposes to the End of all his actions: and
that is merely his own glory. All those his high and unconceiveable acts ad
intra, being immanent in himself, must needs also be terminated in himself. And
as for all those his powerful and providential acts ad extra, those I mean
which are exercised upon and about the creatures, and (by reason of that their
effluxe and emanation) are made better known to us then the former: if we
follow them to their last period, we shall find that they all determine and
concenter there. He made them, he preserves them, he forgiveth them, he
destroys them, he punishes them, he rewards them, every other way he
orders according to the good pleasure of his will, for his own names sake,
and for his own glories sake. That so his wisdom, and power, and truth, and
justice, and mercy, and all those other his divine excellencies, which we are
to believe and admire, (but may not seek to comprehend) might be acknowledged,
reverenced, and magnified. Those two great acts of his most secret and
unsearchable counsel; then the one whereof there is not any one act more
gracious, the Destination of those that persevere in Faith and Godliness to
eternal happiness; nor any one act more full of terror and astonishment then
the other, the designation of such Sin and Infidelity without repentance, to
eternal destruction: the scriptures in the last resolution referr them wholly to
his Glory, as the last End. The glory of his rich mercy being most resplendent
in the one: and the glory of his just severity in the other. Concerning the
one; the scripture says, that he predestined us to the praise of the glory
of his grace, Ephesians. 1.5, 6.
Ephesians. 1. Concerning the other; Prove. 16.4.
The Lord made all things for himself, yea even the wicked for the day of evil.
Prove. 16. He makes it his End: we should make it ours too, if but by way of
Conformity.

13. But he requires it of us secondly, as our bounden Duty, Thankfulness; in
acknowledgement of those many favors we have received from him. What ever we
have, nay, what ever we are; as at first we had it all from him, so we still
hold it all of him: and that jure beneficiario, as feudataries with reservation
of services out of the same, to be performed for the honor of the donour. Our
Apostle therefore in our Lords behalf presses us with the nature of our
tenure, and challenges this duty from us by a claim of right. Ye have them of
God, says he, and ye are not your own: 1 Cor. 6.19, 20.
therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are Gods.
Glorify him in both, because both are his. As the rivers return again to the
place whence they came Eccl. 1. they all come from the Sea, Eccles. 1.7.
and they all run into the Sea again: So all our store, as it issued at first
from the fountain of his grace, so should it all fall at last into the Ocean of
his glory. Romans 11.36.
For of him, and through him, and to him are all things: to him be glory for
ever and ever Amen.

thirdly, in point of Wisdom it would concern us to seek our Masters glory: the
benefit whereof would so abundantly redound upon our selves. For (as was
touched before,) there accrueth no advantage to him thereby: the gain is solely
ours. By seeking his glory, we promote our own: and so by doing him service, we
do upon the point but serve our selves. Does Job, does any man, serve God for
naught? Job. 1.9.
I speak it not for this purpose, as if we should aim at Gods glory, with a
farther aim therein at our own benefit. For that could be but a mercenary
service at the best: neither worthy of him, nor becoming Gods glory be our
farthest End, if we should have another End beyond it, for our selves? I note
it only, to let us see the exceeding goodness of our gracious Lord and Master,
and for our better heartening, that we faint not in his service, who does so
infallibly procure our glory, whilst we unfainedly seek his. And hereof we
have a fair and full assurance, and that from his own mouth, and that in as
plain and express terms, as it is possible for a promise to be made, 1 Samuel 2.
Them that honor me, 1 Samuel 2.30.
I will honor.

the Point thus confirmed, will arise sundry profitable Inferences: some
whereof I shall propose to you, and those all by way of admonition. Since our
chief aim ought to be, that in every thing God may have the glory due to his
name: beware we first, that we do not by base flattery, or other too much
reverence or obsequiousness, give unto any mortal man, or other finite creature
any part of that Honor, which is due to the infinite and immortal God alone.
Not the glory of Omnipotency, unto any power upon earth, be it never so great,
( God spoke once, Psalm. 62.11.
twice have I heard the same, that power belongs unto God. Psalm. 62.)
Experience impotency in them all. Not the glory of Infallibility, to any
judgment be it never so clear; nor to any Iudicatory, be it never so solemn. (
Let God be true, Romans 3.4.
and every man a liar, Romans 3.) Experience shows, there is Error and
Partiality in them all. Not the glory of Religious worship, to any Image,
Saint, Angel, or other Creature, though never so blessed and glorious: Esaias.
42.8.
For God is extremely jealous in that particular above all other. ( My glory
will I not give to another; neither my praise to graven Images: Esaias 42.)
Experience and reason shows, there i^ some deficiency or other in them all.

16. Beware we secondly, that we do not -- sacrilegus invasor gloriae ^uae.
Bern. in Cant. ser. 1^.
sacrilegiously rob -- (...). Chrysostom. in 1 Timothy ser. 3. Act. 5.2.
by deriving the least part of it upon our selves. As Ananias kept back for his
proper use part of the price of his land, when he should have brought in all
for the Churches use. Like Et qui dispensa^, frangit sibi. Juvenal. satyr. 7.
crafty Stewards, that enrich themselves by lessening their Lords ^ines: or
untrusty Servants, that turn some of their Masters goods into money, and then
put the money into their own purses. Non Psalm. 115.1.
non nobis, says David, Psalm. 115. Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but to
thy Name be the praise. He repeateth it twice, that he might disclaim it
wholly; and wash his hands of it so clearly, that not any of it might --
fidelis fa^ulus es, si de multa gloria domini tui -- transeunte per te, nil
tuis manibus adhaerere contingat. Bernard. in Cant. Sermon. 13. Heb. 1.3. Phil
2.6, 7. Heb 5.5. John 8.50. Prove. 25.27.
stick to his fingers: as who say, By no means, to us. Our blessed Lord himself
Christ Jesus, who was the very brightness and express image of his Fathers
glory, and (without robbery) of equal and coeternal glory with him: yet, as he
was man, he did not glorify himself; nay, (let me say more) having taken upon
him the form of a servant, he durst not seek his own glory, but the glory of
his Father that sent him. We use to call it vainglory, own glory unduly or
inordinately; and rightly we so term it: for Vanity is next akin to nothing;
and such glory is no better, if Solomon may be judge, For men to seek their own
glory, is not glory, Prove. 25.

17. But, though we may not seek to pull any glory upon our selves: yet if
others will needs put it upon us unsought for; may we not admit it? may we not
take it, when it is given us? No, that you may not neither. Beware of that
therefore thirdly. It is a Forte grave non est, gloriam et honorem non petere;
sed valde grave est non cum suscipere cum offertur. Gregor. hom. 7. in Evang.
strong temptation, I grant, to our proud minds: but that makes it nothing
the less, it rendereth it rather the more dangerous. For what has any man to
do, to bestow what is none of his? And if we know they have no right to give
it, sure we are greatly to blame, if we - non m^do non ipse sibi accipere
gloriam -- sed nec ab alio quidem recipere oblatam. Bern. in Qui habet. Sermon.
14. Acts 12.22. -- 23.
take it. -- (...). He that receives stolen goods, is not much less guilty
then he that stole them. It did not any thing at all either excuse Herod from
guilt, or exempt him from punishment, that he did no more but admit those
shouts and acclamations, wherewith the people so magnified his eloquence ( It
is the voice of God, and not of man.) Great ones had need take heed how they
listen too much to those that magnify them too much. Because he did not some
way or other show himself flatterers, (not chastening them so much as with a
frown,) nor transmit the glory they cast upon him higher, and where it was of
right due: he stands convicted and condemned upon record, for not giving God
the glory, Acts 12. Marvel not that one of Gods holy Angels was so ready to do
execution upon him there for that fault: when you find another of those holy
Angels so very shy in a case of that nature. Rev. 22.8.9.
Who, when John fell at his feet, with the intent to worship him, timely and
severely forbad him, (...), see thou do it not at any hand; I am but thy
fellow servants: that honor belongs to our Master only, and not to me;
worship God. And how did Paul and Barnabas bestir themselves at Lystra, when
the people began to deifie them, and were preparing Oxen and garlands to
sacrifice to them? Acts 14.11. -- 15.
As soon as ever they heard of it, in token of grief and detestation, they rent
their clothes, and in all haste ran in among the people, crying out, Sirs, what
do you Why do you thus? Mistake not your selves, nor us. Neither are we Jupiter
and Mercury, as you suppose: neither, if we were, are Jupiter and Mercury Gods:
But we men, subject to like passions (both of sin and misery) with you; and
they but Idols and Vanity.

18. There is yet a fourth thing, whereof I cannot but entreat you to be
exceeding wary, above all the rest. Not that it is worse, (nor perhaps simply
so ill) as some of those aforementioned: but that it is in some respects more
dangerous; as being for the most part less suspected then they, and not
altogether so easy to be discerned, as they. And that is this, That we beware
by all means we do not indeed manage our own quarrels, whilst we pretend to
the glory of God. Is it not enough for us, to dote upon our own wild fancies,
as Pigmalion did upon the image himself had carved? Enough, when we have
embraced some fond conceit upon weak grounds through ignorance or prejudice,
to contend with some acrimony for it? Enough, having perhaps over-shot our
selves in some speech or action rashly, to set our selves to maintain it for
our credits sake, when our hearts can tell us all was not right? but we must
needs draw in God, and make him a party in the business: as if the cause were
his, as if in all we had said or done, we him and his glory, nothing less then
our selves and our own interest? Alas what a pity it is, nay what a shame, that
Conscience, Religion, the honor of God, and the vindicating of his glory,
should be made a stale to disloialty, sacrilege, sedition, faction, or private
revenge? Yet so it is daily: and so it ever was, and so it ever will be, more
or less, whilst the World stands. In nomine domini, you know the old saying:
and what a world of errors and mischiefs men have been led into, under that
notion. Those words are used pro forma, and set in the beginning of the
Instrument: when all that follows after in the whole our own wills. Time was,
when they that killed the Apostles, John 16.2.
thought they did God a piece of good service in it: and when our Apostle
before his conversion made havoc of the Church, it was the zeal of Gods glory
that so bemadded him: ( Concerning zeal persecuting the Church.) And neither of
these, Phil. 3.6.
I take it, a pretended zeal, but true and real: that is to say, not
counterfeit, though erroneous.

19. But as in all Monopolies, there is a pretension of some common good held
forth, to make them passable: when as in most of them it may be there is no
good at all intended to the public, private lucre only; or at the best,
together with some little good to the public, such an appearance withal of
private interest over-ballancing it, as that wise men justly fear, they will
prove rather mischievous, then beneficial, taken in the whole lump. So
doubtless many times zeal of Gods glory is unconscionably pretended: where
either it is not at all, but in show; or at leastwise mingled with such a
strong infusion of corrupt partiality and self-seeking, How did the Pharisees
and other Jews juggle with the poor man that had been born blind Ioh. 9.
seeking to work upon him with fair words and pretenses, ( Give God the praise
etc.) when at the same instant they did most wickedly endeavor to obscure the
glory of that miraculous cure, Joh. 9.24.
which Christ had wrought upon him, in giving him his sight.

20. It were no hard matter, if the time would suffer (or indeed if the times
would suffer,) to set before you variety of instances, even unto satiety. But I
shall only give you a taste in matters Ecclesiastical: the one in point of
Government, the other of Worship. For Church Government, who knows not on the
one side, how in some former ages one man, taking the advantage of every
opportunity (whereof the ambitions and factions of Princes and Bishops in every
age afforded good store) to lift up himself still higher and higher, has
perked himself up at length in the Temple of God, there bearing himself as God,
or a vice-god at least: stretching his Diocese over the whole world, and
challenging a Monarchical superintendency over the universal Church of Christ,
as Ecumenical Pastor, or Christ's Vicar General upon earth? And who sees not
on the other side, how busy some spirits have been in this last age and a very
little before, to draw all down to such a Democratical parity (for such indeed
it Aristocratical, as they would fain have the world believe it to be) as was
never practiced, nor, (for any thing appears in the ancient histories and
monuments of the Church) ever so much as heard of, in any settled Church in
Asia, Europe, or Africa, for fifteen hundred years together? Both sides pretend
from Scripture; and for the glory of God, both: and that with equal confidence,
and (for ought I know) upon equal grounds; that is, to speak plain, no grounds
at all for either. For no man yet on either side has been able to make it
sufficiently appear from clear evidence of Scripture or Reason, that it is the
pleasure of God to be glorified by either of new devises.

21. Likewise in point of public worship. How just the blame is on either
side, I dispute not: that is not now the business. But some have been blamed
for bringing into the Church new forms and Ceremonies; or (which is all one in
the apprehensions of men that consider not much, and so is liable to the same
censure,) for reviving old ones, but long dis-used and forgotten: old and new,
and to leave her stark naked of all her ornaments and outward formalities. In
this case also, as in the former, the glory of God is pretended on both sides.
Those thinking their way makes most for the honor of God, as adding decency
and solemnity to his the simplicity of the Gospel.

22. Methinks, dust and ashes that we are, we should tremble to make so bold
with the glory of the great God of heaven and earth, which is the most sacred
thing in the world, as to engage it in our quarrels, and to make it serve to
our humors or ends, when and how we list. Were it not a lamentable case, if it
should ever come to that, that Religion should lie at the top, where avarice,
ambition, or sacrilege lie at the bottom; and perhaps malice, partiality,
oppression, murder, some wicked lust or other in the spirits, and the rashness
of a distempered zeal, to be wiser and holier then God would have us: I mean in
the determining of his glory according to our fancies; where we have no clear
texts of Scripture to assure us, that the glory of God is so much concerned in
these or those particulars, that we so eagerly contend for. Nay, when there
seem to be clear Texts of Scripture, to assure us rather of the contrary, and
that the glory of God does not consist therein, but in things of a higher
nature. For the Kingdom of God is not meat and drink, Romans 14.17.
says the Apostle in the next meats may be eaten or not: for neither if we
eat, nor if we eat not, are we much either the better or the worse for that.
1 Cor. 8.8.
But the kingdom of God is righteousness, and peace, and joy in the holy Ghost.
It consists in the exercise of holy graces, and the conscionable performance
of unquestioned duties. Sincere confession of sin proceeding from an humble and
contrite heart; constancy in professing the true faith of Christ; patience in
suffering adversity, exemplary obedience to the holy laws of God, fruitfulness
in good works: these, these are things wherein God expects to be glorified by
meats and drinks and all other indifferent things, in as much as they have no
intrinsecal moral, either good or evil in them, but are good or evil only
according as they are used well or ill; the glory of God is not at all
concerned in the using or not using of them, otherwise then as our Faith, or
Temperance, or Obedience, or Charity, or other like Christian grace or virtue
is exercised, or evidenced thereby.

23. I have now done with the first thing, and of the most important
consideration, proposed from the Text: to wit, the End it self, the Glory of
God. The amplifications follow: the former That ye may glorify God. If it be
demanded, which God? 1 Cor. 8.5.
For there be Gods many, and Lords many. It is answered in the Text, ( God even
the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.) Of which title there may be sundry
reasons given: some more general, why it is used at all: some more special, why
it should be used here. First, this Stylo novo: never found in the Old
Testament; but very often in the New. Ephesians. 3.14. 2 Cor. 11.31. 1 Pet. 1.
(For this cause I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Ehpes.
3. The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ knows that I lie not, 2 Cor.
11. Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, 1 Pet. 1.) As the
old Covenant ceased upon the bringing in of a new and better Covenant: so there
was a cessation of the old style, upon the bringing in of this new and better
style. The old ran thus, Exodus 3.15.
The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob: proclaimed by God
himself, when he was about to deliver the posterity of those three godly
Patriarchs from the bondage of Egypt. glorious deliverance then that, from a
far more grievous bondage then that, (from under Sin, Satan, Death, Hell, and
the Law,) whereof that of Egypt was but a shadow and type: he has quitted that
style, and now expects to be glorified by this most sweet and blessed Name,
The Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Exchanging the Name of God, a name of
greater distance and terror; into the Name of Father, a name of more neerness
and indulgence. And taking the additional title or denomination, not from the
parties delivered, (as before,) who were his faithful servants indeed, yet but
servants: but from the person delivering, his only begotten and only beloved
Son. the Evangelical style.

24. Secondly, this style puts a difference between the true God of Heaven
and Earth, whom only we are to glorify: and all other false and imaginary
titular gods, to whom we ow^ nothing but scorn and detestation. The Pagans had
scores, hundreds, (some have reckoned thousands) of gods; all of their own
making. Every Nation, every City, yea almost every House had their several gods
or godlings; 1 Cor. 8.6.
Deos topicos; gods many, and lords many. But to us, says our Apostle, (to us
Christians,) there is but one God the Father, and one Lord Jesus Christ, his
Son. This is Deus Christianorum. receive grace from that God, that alone can
give it; or mean as Christians to give glory to that God, that alone ought to
have it: this, this is he, and none other; God even the Father of our Lord
Jesus Christ. It is a style of distinction.

25. These two Reasons are general. There are two other more special; for the
use of it here: in respect of some congruity it has with the matter or method
of the Apostles present discourse. For first, it might be done with reference
to that Argument, which he had so lately pressed, and whereof also he had given
a touch immediately former Verse, and which he also resumed again in the next
following Verse; drawn from the example of Christ. That since Christ, in
receiving us, and condescending to our weaknesses, did aim at his Fathers
glory: so we also should the same end, by treading in the same steps. We cannot
better glorify God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, then by receiving one
another into our charity, care, and mutual support, as Jesus Christ also
received us to the glory of his heavenly Father.

26. Secondly, since we cannot rightly glorify God, unless we so conceive him
as our Father ( -- If I be a Father where is mine honor? Mal. 1. -- That they
may see your good works, Mal. 1.6. Matthew. 5.16.
and glorify your Father which is in heaven, Mat. 5.) it may be the Apostle
would have us take knowledge how we came to have a right to our sonship; and
for that end might use the title here given, to intimate to us upon what Lord
and Master, as to call him our Father: even no other but this, because he is
the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is the only Son of God by
nature and generation: and through him only it is, that we are made the sons
of God by grace and adoption. (As many as received him, to them he gave power
to be made the sons of God, John 1.) If we be the sons of God, we are made so:
John 1.12.
but he is the Son of God, not made, nor created, but begotten. I go to my
Father, and to your Father, says he himself John 20. Mine first: Athanas. in
Symbolo.
and then, and therefore, yours also. He is medium unionis: John 20.17.
like the corner stone, wherein both sides of the building unite; or like the
whereon Jacob saw Angels ascending and descending. Gen 28.12.
All intercourse, 'twixt Heaven and Earth, God and Man; is in and through him.
If any grace come from God to us, it is by Christ: If any glory come from us to
God, it is by Christ too. Ephesians. 3.21.
( Unto him be glory in the Church by Christ Jesus, Ephesians. 3.) And this shall
suffice to have spoken concerning the former amplification: briefly, because it
seems not to conduce so much, nor so nearly to the Apostles main scope here,
as does that other, which now follows; respecting the manner. [With one mind
and with one mouth.]

27. Wherein, omitting (for brevities sake) such advantages, first, that
whereas he names two instruments wherewith we are to glorify God, the one
inward ( the Mind) the other outward the Mouth:) he names the inward first.
The mind must be first, and before the mouth, in this service. Else we shall
incur that reproof in the Prophet Esaias, as well as the Pharisees did, to whom
our Savior applies it in the Gospel ( This people draws near me with their
mouth, Esaias 20.12. Matthew. 15 8.
and honors me with their lips: but their hearts have they removed far from
me. Or that other in Jeremy 12. in words not much unlike, Thou art near in
calls his tongue his glory, Psalm 108. for this reason (as I conceive) among
others, because the chiefest employment he had for it, was to glorify God with
it. But if when his tongue was so employed, his mind had not gone with it; if
he had not roused up himself, that is, his heart and his mind, (for (...).
Plato. Psalm. 108.2.
the mind, that is the man) as well as his tongue (Awake my glory, awake Lute
and Harp, I my self will awake right early:) the best music of his tongue,
with Lute and Harp to boot, Heb. 4 12.
had been no better, then sounding brass, or a tinckling Cymbal. God is (...),
an exact critic in spelling and examining the thoughts of our hearts most
accurately. He minds us, how we mind him in all our services: And will no
more take himself to be honored by us, Mat. 7.21. Luke 18.11.
when we cry Lord, Lord, or (as the Pharisee) God I thank thee; if our minds
the while be aloof off, hankering after the world, or our own base lusts: then
Christ took himself to be honored by the soldiers, Matthew. 27.29, 30.
that put a reed into his hand instead Scepter; and bowed the knee before him,
saying, Hail King of the Jews, and then presently spat upon him, and smote him
on the head. Let us be sure then, if we mean God should have any glory from us,
in all our addresses and services to take our minds along with us.

28. But then observe secondly, that though the mind is to go first, yet the
mouth must bear a part too. We may not think we glorify God sufficiently, Romans
10.10.
if with the heart we believe in him, unless with the mouth also we be ready
to confess him. David therefore professes very often in the Psalms, that he
would perform his services mouth and lips. Psalm. 51.15. -- 63.5.
(Open thou my lips, and my mouth shall show thy praise. My soul shall be
satisfied as it were with marrow and fatness, whilst my tongue praises thee
with joyful lips,) and in many other places. Nor indeed can it be otherwise:
for if the inward parts be right set, the outward will follow of themselves. A
full heart cannot but overflow, when time serves, out of its own abundance:
and if there be much heat there, it will break out at the lips. Psalm. 39.4.
My heart was hot within, says David, and whiles I was musing, the fire
kindled, and at last I spoke with my tongue, Psalm. 39. And in another Psalm, as
his heart was busy enditing of a good matter, -- 45.1.
the pen of a ready writer, to take it as fast as his heart could dictate it.
Heart and Tongue, Mind and Mouth, both must join together, and if there be any
thing else in us besides, that can contribute any furtherance to the work, it
must in too: and all little enough, to glorify our Maker.

29. Observe thirdly and principally, (for the weight of the Amplification
lies most there,) that God is much glorified by unity, peace and concord. This
observation arises clearly from the main scope of the words. He had exhorted
them at large, to study to be like-minded: and he prays in the verse next
before, that that ye may with one mind and with one mouth glorify God. Which
argument were of very little force, if unanimity and like-mindedness were not a
thing very subservient to Gods glory. What an honor is it to the when all
Israel comes in as one man to do him worship! God has bestowed gifts upon
his Church, 1 Cor. 12.4 -- 6
and disposed the persons therein into several ranks, administrations, and
offices, with admirable variety. Not that they should jarr and clash one
against another, and pull every one from other what they can for themselves:
for that would soon bring all to confusion first, and then to destruction. But
that each should sustain other, and mutually supply out of their several stores
the wants each of other, for the better preservation of the whole, and the more
comfort of the several parts. As the variety of instruments and voices, is so
far from hindering the music, that it makes it up: (for what else is musical
but concordia discors, variety in consort?) the music could not be either so
full, or delightful without some variety. But then care must be had of two
things, first, that the instruments be well in tune, (not only each within it
self, but well timed also one to another:) and then that the minstrels agree to
play the same lesson.

30. If either of these be wanting, all the music is marred. For the tuning;
if any one single string, of any one single instrument in the whole consort
should be out of tune, though but a little (say it be no more difference then a
flat and a sharp) aures eruditae far Any thing that is tolerable will pass
among country people: but the least discord in the world will offend a choice
and delicate ear. But if it should be very much out of tune; it would be
harsh, and grate even a thick and vulgar ear. But say all the instruments
should be perfectly well tuned; yet if the men should not agree what to play,
but one would have a grave Pavane, another a nimbler Galliard, a third some
frisking toy or Iigg, and then all of them should be wilful, none yield to his
fellow, but every one scrape on his own tune as loud as he could: what a
hideous hateful noise may you imagine would such a mess of Music be? No less I
am of Paul, and I of Cephas, and I of Apollo. 1 Cor. 1.12.
When (as it is now grown with us) one Pamphleter must have the Church
governed after this fashion, another after that. Twenty several models and
platforms of government: just as one of our own Spencer in Fairy Queen.
Poets (of good note in his time) has long since described Errors Children; a
numerous brood, but never a one like other; saving only in this, that they were
all ill-favored alike. And these Models printed, and published to the world,
and dispersed through all parts of the kingdom, ecchoed in the pulpits: to the
manifest dishonor of God, the deep scandal of the reformed Religion, and
eternal infamy both of our Church and State, and God knows what other sad and
desperate consequents in future; if some speedy and effectual course be not
taken to repress the unsufferable licenciousness both of our Presses and
Pulpits.

31. But I will repress my self howsoever. Indignation, though a digression,
ere he be aware: though I do not perceive, that I have yet digressed very much.
To return therefore; As I have heard those words of the last Psalm read
monthly in our Churches, Psalm. 150.5.
( Praise him upon the well tuned Cymbals, praise him upon the loud Cymbals:)
it has often come into my thoughts, that when we intend to glorify God with
our Cymbals, it should not be our only care to have them loud enough; but our
first care should be to have them well-tuned: else, the louder, the worse. Zeal
does very well: there is great, yea necessary use of it, in every part of Gods
service. The Cymbal will be flat; it will have loud enough without it. But if
meekness, peaceableness, and moderation, do not first put the Cymbal into good
tune: the loudness will but make it the more ungraceful in the player, the more
ungrateful to the hearer.

32. But I will pursue this Metaphor no further. There is another Metaphor also
much used by our Apostle: that of Edification. He would have all things in the
Church done to Edifying. And if you will take the pains to examine it, 1 Cor.
14.26.
you shall find that most times where he speaks of glorifying God, he does
it with reference to Edification; and most times where he speaks of Edifying,
he does it with reference to those mutual respects and charitable offices,
whereby we apply our selves to our brethren for the maintenance of peace and
unity. That passage (for example) before mentioned, (Whether ye eat or drink, 1
Cor. 10.31.
or whatsoever else ye do, let all be done to the glory of God) is meant
especially in the case of brotherly condescension, in yielding somewhat to the
infirmities of our brethren for charities sake, where in godly wisdom we shall
see it expedient so to do, for theirs, our own, or the common good: as is
evident from the whole frame of his discourse there. And so it is here also: He
speaks of bearing the infirmities of our weaker brethren, verse. 1. of not
pleasing our selves, but each man pleasing his brother for his good unto
edification, verse. 2. of receiving one another by Christ's example, verse. 7. and
he comes votive prayer, that God would grant them to be like minded one unto
another; that so by their unanimity they might glorify God. That is, that
their like-mindedness might serve to Gods glory, in the edification of their
brethren.

33. Now if that which best edifieth the Church, do also most glorify God, (as
these and the like passages seem to import;) then certainly not by many things
is God more glorified, then by Peace, and Concord: since few things edify more
then these do. As to the use of Edification, Knowledge (that seems to be all
in all with some,) is very little or nothing in comparison; or but a puff to
Charity. 1 Cor. 8.1.
It may swell, look big, and make a show: but Charity does the deed. -- 1.10.
S. Paul was a wise Master Builder, and knew compacting the Church into a
building, Ephesians. 4.16.
mentions the edifying of it self in love Ephesians. 4. It has been my hap
heretofore more then once, yet both times led thereunto by the Texts, to insist
somewhat upon this Metaphor: which makes me the unwillinger to dwell upon it
the third time. Yet since it appears to have been of so frequent and familiar
use with our Apostle, and is withal so pertinent both to the process of his
discourse in this place, and to the business now in hand: I cannot but desire
to press it a little farther, and that in two respects especially, and both of
them very considerable building: to wit, Dispatch and Strength.

34. For Dispatch first. No man that goes about a building, but would
willingly get it up as fast as he can, without any delay or let, more then
needs must. Now where the workmen, and laborers ( layers, fillers, servers,
and the rest) agree fairly, first to do every man what belongs to him in his
own office, and then to further every one another in theirs: the work goes on,
and gets up apace. But if they once begin to fall out one with another: then
are they ready to hinder and to cross one another; and then the work stands.
When one of them has laid a course in pulls the stones all asunder, and
throws them down: One says, it shall be thus; another starteth up and
swears it shall not be so, but thus; and then they grow to hot words, and
from words to blows, and so instead of pointing the wall, fall a thrusting
their trowels in one another faces: How should the work go an end now, think
you, with any good expedition? When one builds and another pulls down,
Sirac. 34.23.
what profit have they then but labor? says the wise son of Sirac, Eccl. 34.
A great deal of noise, and a great deal of bustle: but little work done. It is
even so in all other things: distraction ever hinders business. The must
needs move slowly, when some of them that sweat at the Oar, ply with all the
strength they have to thrust her Eastward, and other some of them, ply as hard
to drive her Westward.

35. Nor is it otherwise in the Church and Commonwealth, when -- humilit^r
subesse, and utiliter preaesse: obedire sponte, and imperare discrete. Bern.
Par. ser. 56.
Superiors rule with moderation, Inferiors obey with cheerfulness, all men
(keeping themselves within their own ranks and stations) bend themselves with
their utmost diligence to advance the public welfare: the work commonly
rises apace, and prospers in their hands. But if they that work above,
shall strive only how to extend their Power; and they that work below shall
strive as much, Liberty; the one to impose, the other to refuse, what they
list: If those shall hold them stiffly at this point, We may do it, and
therefore we will do it; and these as stiffly at this; We may choose, and
therefore we will not do it; when shall they meet? where is that (...)? that
yielding and condescension the Apostle so often requires? It were a blessed
thing, (and till it be so in some measure, the building will never rise to
purpose,) if men power, what they may do; or at their liberty, what they may
not do, so to serve their own turns, humors, or ends: as how to use both
power, and liberty, with all due sobriety and charity, Phil. 2.4.
to the glory of God in the good of others. If we could once grow to that, not
to look every one on his own things, but every man also on the things of
others, as S. Paul elsewhere exhorts: then should we also agree with one
mind and heart to follow the work close, till we had got it up. That for
dispatch.

36. But hasle makes waste, we say. It does so: and in building as much as in
any thing. It were good wisdom therefore to strong withal: lest if we make
false work for quicker dispatch, we repent our overhasty building by leisure.
To rid us of that fear; know secondly, that unity and concord serves for
strength too, as well as dispatch. Evermore virtus unita fortior: Matthew. 12.25.
but division weakneth. A house divided against it self cannot stand: and the
wall must needs be hollow and loose, where the stones stand off one from
another, and couch not close. Now brotherly love and unity is it, that binds
all fast; so making of loose heaps one entire piece. I beseech you, brethren
(says the Apostle) that there be no divisions among you, 1 Cor. 1.10.
but that ye be perfectly 1 Cor. 1. Like-mindedness, you see, is the thing that
joyneth all together: and in the well joining consists the strength of any
structure. In Ephesians. 4. therefore he speaks of the bond of peace: Ephesians. 4.3.
Col. 3.14.
and in Colos. 3. he calls love the bond of perfectness.

37. In Phil. 1. he has another expression, which also notably confirms the
same truth. Phil. 1.27.
That I may hear, says he, of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit
with one mind. They never stand so fast, as when they are of one mind. There
is a Greek word sometimes used in the New Testament ((...) is the word)
confusion, and sometimes tumult. Not unfitly for the sense, either: but in the
literal notation it imports a kind of unstableness rather, or unsetledness;
when a thing does not stand fast, but shakes and tottereth, and is in danger
of falling. And this S. Paul opposes to peace, 1 Cor. 14. God is not the
author ((...),) of confusion, or unstableness, but of peace: By that very
opposition intimating, that it is mostly for want of peace, that things do not
stand fast, but are ready to fall into disorder and confusion. S. James
speaks out, what S. Paul but intimates, and tells us plainly, that this
(...) is the effect of discord, James 3.16.
and that contention is the Mother of confusion. For where envying and strife
is, says he, there is (...), inconstancy, unsetledness, confusion and every
evil work. The builders make very ill work, where the building is not like to
stand, but threatens ruin, and is ready to drop down again, by that it be
well up. And ill work does envying and strife ever make: it is concord only and
unity that makes good work, and builds strong. Let Jerusalem be built, as a
city at unity in it self: and Jerusalem will be like to stand the faster, and
to stand up the longer. Psalm. 122.3.


38. For a conclusion of all, I cannot but once again admonish, and earnestly
entreat all those, that in contending with much earnestness for matters of no
great consequence, have the glory of God ever and anon in their mouths: that
they would take heed of embarquing God and his glory so deep in every trifling
business, and such as wherein there is not dignus vindice nodus. But since it
clearly appears from this and sundry other Texts of holy Scripture, peace and
love are of those things, whereby our gracious Lord God takes himself to be
chiefly glorified: that they would rather faithfully endeavor by their
peaceable, charitable, and amiable carriage toward others, especially in such
things, as they cannot but know to be (in the judgment of sundry men both
learned and godly) accounted but of inferior and indifferent nature, to
approve to God, the World, and their own consciences, that they do sincerely
desire to glorify God, by pleasing their brethren for their good unto
edification. Which that we all unfeinedly may do, I commend us and the grace
and blessing of Almighty God: dismissing you once again, as I did heretofore,
with the Apostles benediction in the Text; (for I know not where to fit my self
better,) Now the God of patience and consolation grant you, to be like-minded
one toward another, according unto Christ Jesus; That ye may with one mind,
and with one mouth, glorify God even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.

To which God the Father, and his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, and the blessed
spirit of them both; three persons, etc.


WOBVRNE. 1647. August.
Psalm 27.10. When my Father and my Mother forsake me, the Lord takes me up.


1. THings that have a natural weakness in them to bear up themselves, do by a
natural instinct lean toward, and (if they can find it) clasp about,
something that may sufficiently support them: but in default of such, will
catch and twine about whatsoever is next them, that may be any little stay to
them for any little time. So a Hop, for want of a strong pole, will wind it
self about a Thistle or Nettle, or any sorry weed. The heart of man, whilst it
seeks abroad for somewhat without it self, to rest it self upon; does even
thereby sufficiently bewray a secret consciousness in it self of its own
insufficiency to stand without something to support it. If it find not that
which is the only true support indeed; it will stay it self as long as it can
upon a weak staff, rather then none. Chariots, Horses, and Riches, and Friends,
etc. any thing will serve to trust in; whilst no better appears.

2. But that our hearts ( deceitful as they are,) delude us not with vain
confidences; we may learn from the Text, where it is, and where alone, that we
may repose our selves with full assurance of hope not to fail. David affirms
positively, what he had found true by much experience: that when all others,
from whom we expect help, either will not, or cannot; God both can and will
help us, so far as he sees it good for us, if we put our trust in him. When my
Father and Mother forsake me, the Lord will take The words import, First, a
possibility of failing in all inferior helps, It is supposed Fathers and
Mothers, (and proportionably all other friends and helps,) may forsake us, and
leave us succourless: [ when my Father and my Mother forsake me.] Secondly, a
never-failing sufficiency of help and relief from God, though all other helps
should fail us: [ Then the Lord will take me up.] The two points we are to
speak to.

3. Father and Mother. First, who are they? Properly and chiefly, our natural
Parents, of whom we were begotten and born; to whom (under God) we owe our
being and breeding. Yet here, not they only; but by Synecdoche all other
kinsfolks, neighbors, friends, acquaintance: or indeed more generally yet, all
worldly comforts, stays, and helps whatsoever. 2. But then, why these named
the rathest; and the rest to be included in these? Because we promise to our
selves more help from them, then from any of the other. We have a nearer
relation to, and a greater interest in, them then any other: and they, of all
other, are the unlikeliest to forsake us. The very bruit Creatures forsake not
their young ones. Mat. 23.37. Prove. 17^^^
A Hen will not desert her chickins: nor a Bear endure to be robbed of her
whelps. 3. But then Thirdly, why both named? Father, and Mother too? Partly,
because it can hardly be imagined, that both of them should forsake their
child, though one should hap to be unkind. Partly, because (...). Naz. Orat.
16.
the Fathers love providence, the Mothers with more tenderness; both together
do better express, then either alone would do, the abundant love of God toward
us: who is infinitely dear over us, beyond the care of the most provident
Father, beyond the affection of the tenderest Mother: 4. But then Fourthly,
when may they be said to forsake us? When at any time they leave us destitute
of such help, as we stand in need of. Whether it be out of Choice; when list
not help us, though they might if they would: or out of necessity, when they
cannot help us, though they would, if they could.

4. The meaning of the words in the former part of the verse thus opened: the
result thereof is, that There is a possibility of failing in all inferior
helps. Fathers and Mothers; our nearest and dearest comforts: always may fail
us, sometimes will fail us, and at last must fail us; leaving us destitute and
succourless. The truth whereof will the better appear; if, instancing
especially in our natural Parents (as the Text leads us) we take a view of
sundry particular causes of their so failing us, under the two general heads
but now mentioned: to wit, Choice, and Necessity. Under either kind, three.
Sometimes they forsake us voluntarily and of their own accord, and through
their own default; when it is in their power to help us, if they were so
pleased: which kind of forsaking may arise from three several Causes.

Natural Parents may prove unnatural, merely out of the naughtiness of their
own hard and incompassionate hearts. For although God has imprinted this
natural affection toward their own offspring in the hearts of men, (...).
in as deep and indeleble characters, as almost any other branch of the Law of
Nature, ( O nimium potens, Quanto parents sanguinis vinculo tenes, Natura!)
yet so desperately wicked is the heart of man, that if it should be left to the
wildeness of its own corruption, without any other bridle then the light of
natural principles only, it would eft-soons shake off that also: and quite raze
out all impressions of the Law of Nature; at least so blur and confound the
characters, that the Conscience Duty out of them. Else what needed the Apostle,
among other sins, to have listed this (...), this want of natural affection, in
two several Catalogues Romans 1. and 2 Timothy 3? Romans 1.31. 2 Timothy 3.3. Tit. 2.4.
Or to have charged Titus, that young women should be taught among other things,
to be (...), to love their Children: if he had not observed some to have
neglected their duty in that particular; hereof Histories and experience afford
us many examples. Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not
have compassion of the son of her womb? says the Lord by the Prophet. He
speaks of it, as of (...). Eurip. in Phoeniss. Act. 2. (...) Id in Iphig. in
Aul. Act. 4. Deuteronomy. 13.7.
scarce credible of any; Can she forget? (she in the singular number:) But
withal in the same words implyedly confessing it possible in more then one:
Yea, they may forget: (They, in the plural number.) Esaias 49.15.

6. Secondly, Parents not altogether void of natural affection, may yet have
their affections so alienated from their children upon some personal dislike,
as to forsake them. Of which dislike I not deny but there may be just cause. As
among the Hebrews in the case of Blasphemy, the fathers hand was to be first in
the execution of his son Deuteronomy. 13. And both Civilians and Casuists allow the
Father jus abdicationis a right of Abdication in some cases. But such cases are
not much pertinent here, or considerable as to our purpose. For they that give
their earthly Parents just cause to forsake them, can have little confidence
that God as their heavenly Father should take them up. But when Parents shall
withdraw their love and help from their children upon some small oversights, or
venial without cause, or more then there is cause; upon some wrong either
surmise of their own, or suggestion of others; 1 Samuel 20.30, 33. -- 22.8.
(as Saul reviled Jonathan, and threw a Iavelin at him to smite him;
interpreting his friendship with David, as it had been a plotted conspiracy
between his son and his servant, to take his crown and his life from him:) Or
when they shall disinherit their children for some deformity of body, or defect
of parts, or the like: As reason shows it to be a great sin, and not to be
excused by any pretense: so it is an observation grounded upon manifold
experience, that where the right heirs have been dis-inherited the persons, and
seldom has the estate prospered in the hands of those that have succeeded in
their rooms.

7. Thirdly, parents whose affection toward their children has not been
sowred by any personal dislike; may yet have their affection so over-powred by
some stronger lust, as to become cruel to their children, and forsake them. For
as in the World, Might oftentimes over-beareth Right: so in the soul of man,
the violence of a stronger passion or affection (which in the case in hand may
the weaker. It may happen, as sometimes it has done, out of superstition. So
Agamemnon sacrificed his daughter Iphigenia. Euripid. in Iphig. and alii.
The Heathens, generally, deceived by their cheating Oracles, and some of the
Jews led by their example, Psalm. 106.37. Jer. 32.35.
sacrificed their sons and daughters unto devils, and caused their children to
pass through the fire to Molech. Sometimes out of revenge. As Medea to be
revenged of Jason for leaving her and placing his affection elsewhere, slew her
own two sons begotten by him in his sight. ( Virg. eclog. 8
Saevus amor docuit natorum sanguine matres Commaculasse manus.) Sometimes out
of fear. So the parents John 9. but for fear of being cast out of the Synagogue
durst not speak a word in his just defense; John 9.21. -- 23.
but left him to shift as well as he could for himself. And Herod the great,
for no other cause then his own causeless fears and jealousies, Josephus.
destroyed many of his own sons. Sometimes out of the extremity and impatience
of hunger. As in the sad story of the two mothers, 4 Kings 6.28, 29. Deuteronomy.
28.53.
who in the great famine at the siege of Samaria had covenanted to dress their
children by turns, and to eat them: so fulfilfilling, even to the letter, that
heavy curse which God had long before threatened against Israel in case of
their disobedience. Sometimes voluptuousness and sensuality. As do thousands of
prodigal ding-thrifts every where in the World; who by gaming, drinking,
luxury, and other riot and intemperance vainly wasting their estates, 2 Cor.
12.14.
(out of which, by S. Paul's rule, they ought to provide and lay up for their
children,) bring themselves to penury, and leave their children to beggary.

fathers and mothers so often to forsake their children: the less are we to
marvel, if our brethren, kinsfolks and neighbors; if our familiar
acquaintance, companions, and friends, prove unfaithful, and shrink from us
when we stand in need to them: dealing deceitfully as a brook. It is Jobs
comparison, Job 6. The Brooks in Winter, Job 6.15, etc.
when the Springs below are open, and the bottles of heaven power down water
from above, overflow the banks and the medows all about, and look like a little
Sea: but when the heat of Summer is come, and the season dry, vanish; so as the
weary traveller can find no refreshing, nor the cattle quench their thirst
thereat. Such is the common friendship of the World. Whilst we are full and
stand in no need of them; they are also full of kindness, and overflow with
protestations of love and service. Amici divitis multi; Prove. 14.20. Sirac.
37.1. Psalm 12.2,
every friend will say, I am his friend also. Yet they talk but vanity all this
while, every one with his neighbor: they do but flatter with their lips, and
dissemble with their double heart. When we seek to them (...). Eurip. in
Phaeniss. act. 2.

(...). Id. in Herc. fur. act. 2 -- Diffugiunt cadis cum faece siccatis amici.
Horat. 1 Od. 3 Luke 10.32. Psalm. 41.9.


in our need, they look upon us slightly, and at a distance; at the most, let
fall some overly expressions that they wish us well, and pity our case, ( Good
words are good cheap:) but do little or nothing we are up and aloft, they will
crouch under us, apply themselves to us, lend a shoulder, ey and sweat, to lift
us up yet higher. But if we be going down; then at the best, (as the Priest and
Levite in the parable) they will see and not see, but pass by, without so much
as offering a hand to help us up: nay, it is well, if they lift not up the heel
against us, and help to tread us yet lower.

9. As then first, natural parents many times want natural affection: so common
friends many times want common honesty, and fail those that trust to them. And
as they secondly sometimes withdraw their love from their children upon slender
dislikes: so these many actum est de amicitia!) and pick quarrels to desert us,
when we have not done any thing that may justly deserve it at their hands. And
as they lastly too much forgot their children, whilst they too eagerly pursue
their own lusts: so these to serve their own ends, lay aside all relations, and
break through all obligations of friendship: and if our occasions require
something should be done for us, that may chance put them to some little
trouble, hazard, or charge, or otherwise stands not with their liking; put us
off, as they did their fellow-virgins, Ne non sufficiat, Mat. 25.9.
voluntary forsaking; wherein the fault is theirs: when our fathers and mothers
and friends might help us, but do not.

10. The other kind is an enforced forsaking, and without their fault: when
they cannot help us, if they would. Which also arises from three other causes;
Ignorance, Impotency, Mortality: First, there is in the understandings of men a
great deal of darkness, Truth and Falsehood, even in speculativis, matters
which stand at a certain stay, and alter not: but much more for the discerning
of Good and Evil in Practicis; matters, which by reason of the multiplicity of
uncertain and mutable Circumstances are infinitely various. Whereby it becomes
a matter of greater difficulty, to avoid folly in practice then Error in
judgment. No wonder then, if the carefullest Parents, and faithfullest Friends
be many times wanting in their help to those they wish well to: when either
they can find no way at all, whereby to do them good; or else pitch upon a
wrong one, whereby unawares they do them harm. Hor. 2. Ep. 1.
Sedulitas autem stulte quem diligit, urget.
-- Nil moror officium, quod me gravat.
The body of a Patient may be in such a condition of distemper, that the
learned Doctor may be at a stand, not knowing perfectly what to make of it:
and so must either let it alone, and do nothing; or else adventure upon such
probabilities, as may lead him to mistake the Cause, and so the disease, and so
the cure; and the Patient by those very means, whereby he intended his
recovery. So Parents and others that love their children or friends well, and
desire nothing more then to do them good; may be so puzzled sometimes by the
unhappy conjuncture of some cross circumstances, as that they cannot resolve
upon any certain course how to dispose of them, deal with them, or undertake
for them with any assurance, or but likely hope, of a good effect: but they
must either leave them to wrestle with their own burdens, as well as they can;
or else fall upon some course at all adventure, (intending their good thereby,)
which may perhaps in the event undoing.

11. And as we may fail of needful help from our best friend for lack of skill:
so may we also secondly, for want of Power. Verily all sufficiency is not to be
found but in the Almighty Creator alone. No Creature can yield out of his own
sufficiency, a salve for every sore, a supply for every want, a help for every
defect: but there is some impotency, some vacuity, some deficiency in the best.
Agar loved her infant well enough, and knew too well enough what would save his
life for that time, Genesis 21.15, 16.
if she could tell how to get it. But all the water in the bottle being spent,
and no more dry wilderness, no help but she must forsake him, and (for ought
she knew, and relating but to ordinary means,) he must perish. All she could do
was, to cast the poor child under a shrub, and get her a good way off, that
she might not see him die; and to lift up her own voice, that she might not
hear his. Genesis 21. Moses his parents, when they had hid him as long as they
could or durst, at last forsook him, Exodus 2.3. 3 King. 17.12.
and left him in the s^ags by the brink of the River Nilus Exodus 2. The widow
of Sarepta also 3 King. 17. in the long drought and famine, being stored of
provision but for one single repast for her self and her son, saw no
possibility of farther relief for her self and him; nor knew how to show her
love to him otherwise; then by dying with him for company. By fire, water, long
sickness, suits, plunderings, and a thousand casualties, our distresses may be
such; as that our dearest and greatest friends may not be able to relieve us.

Ignorance, and Impotency; whereby they may forsake us whilst they are: but
there also thirdly under a state of mortality; and so must needs forsake us,
when they shall be no more. Put not your trust in Princes, Psalm. 146.2.
nor in any child of man: for there is no help in them. Psalm. 146. No is? Sure
some help there is, some little help in them, whilst they live, and are in
power? But the meaning is, there is no certain help in them; none for a man to
trust to: because there is no certainty how long they shall enjoy that life and
Power. For so the reason there follows; For when the breath of man goes
forth, -- 3.
he shall turn The Prophet accordingly Esaias 2. Cease ye from man, whose breath
is in his nostrils: Esaias 2.22.
for wherein is he to be accounted of? The Soul and Body (in whose conjunction
life consists) are tied together by no stronger a thread, then the breath that
passes in and out by the Nostrils. Cut that thread, stop that breath: down
falls the tallest, and the stoutest, and the proudest of the sons of men; and
when he falls, all his wealth, and all his pomp, and all his thoughts and
devices, and projects and contrivances fall with him. And this the end of every
man; the utmost period of the race, the last act upon the stage: Eccl. 9.6.
neither And how should they then help others, that can no longer sustain
themselves? Needs must they forsake us, when breath and life forsakes them. So
it is with all other earthly comforts whatsoever; pleasures, riches, honors,
and the rest. When their time is come, they vanish; make themselves wings, and
away they hie: Prove. 23.5.
and when they are upon the wing; look after them we may a little while, and to
little purpose, but reclaim them we cannot. They soon get out of sight, Jer.
3.15.
leaving us behind to grieve for the losse^ (as Rachel for her children)
mourning, and refusing to be comforted, because they are no^.

13. The more unwise we, to raise to our selves such vast hopes, as sometimes
we do, upon so narrow, so frail a bottom. Would any wise man when he might
have a staff, lean the weight of his body upon a crutch of reed? or trust to a
gutter-spout to quench his thirst, when he might go to a spring? Yet so is he,
that puts his trust in any earthly Father or Friend, or in any child of man,
creature or thing, Jer. 2.13.
besides God: That forsaking the fountain of living waters, which runs clear
and can never be drawn dry; diggeth to himself broken pits, that can hold but
a little water, and that but muddy at the best, and yet cannot hold that long
neither. You shall find set down in Psalm. 20. the different confidences of the
worldling and the true believer; and their different successes. Their
confidences ver. 7. Some put their trust in chariots, and some in horses; (and
so in other things:) but we will remember the name of the Lord our God. Their
Successes ver. 8. They are cast down and fallen: but we are risen and stand
upright. David Goliath met upon these very terms. He came out against David,
trusting in the arm of flesh: David went out against him in the name of the
Lord of hosts. 1 Samuel 17.45.
And they prospered accordingly. Behold Goliath is brought down; David rises:
Goliath falls; David stands upright. Psalm. 33.17.
Fallax equus; A horse is counted but a vain thing, (and a vain thing it is to
count otherwise of him; for he is truly but a vain thing) to save a man. So are
Chariots, and Forts, and Armies, and Navies, and all earthly reliances. He that
rests upon them; down come they, and then down comes he too. The horse and
the rider both, thrust into the sea together Exodus 15. Woe unto them then that
stay on horses, Exodus 15.1.
or trust in chariots: when the Esaias 31.1. -- 3.
both he that helps shall fall, and he that is helped shall fall down, and
they shall all fail together. Esaias 31.

14. It were good wisdom for us therefore to deal safely; ((...) has ever been
held a wholesome politic aphorism by the wise ones of the world:) never to rely
on those that may deceive us; to esteem all outward helps but as they are; and
to use them, and to trust to them accordingly. That is to say; as blessed means
of our good and comfort, so long as God is pleased to lend them us, and to
sanctify them to us: but such as we can have no hold of, neither any assurance
that they shall not fail us. To honor our Fathers and Mothers; to love our
friends and allies; to pray for the lives and prosperity of Kings and Princes:
Again, to gather wealth by fair and just means; to raise our selves to honors
by faithful services and virtuous endeavors; to take our portion of lawful and
regular pleasures: These we may do; those we must do. But take we heed we
place not our felicity in the enjoyment, or please our selves too much in the
confidence, or allow our selves overmuch freedom in the use of any creature.
Lest as Jonas was overjoyed when the gourd sprang up, Jon. 4.6, 8.
and over-vexed when it withered: so the loss of what we over-valued whiles we
had it, overwhelme Quem res plus nimio delectavere secundae, Horat. 1. Epist.
10.
Mutatae quatient.

15. If we would seriously consider, what defects the things of this world are
subject unto, and what casualties, and frailties: threefold benefit thereby. It
would make us first, receive these outward things with more thankfulness;
secondly, use them with more moderation; thirdly, forgo them with more
patience then usually we do. Horat. 3. od. 29.
Laudo manentem: si celeres quatit Pennas, resigno quae dedit; as he said of
Fortune. Whilst we have them, it will become us to bless God for them, and to
make our best of them: But if they will be gone; farewell they: let them go;
but let us bear up notwithstanding, since we are neither hopeless, nor
helpless. When all fails, we have yet one string left, which we are sure will
hold: even the Name of the Lord our God; who stands ever by us, ready to take
us up, when all others forsaken us. Which is the other point in those later
words of the verse. The Lord takes me up.

16. The primary signification of the Hebrew Verb here used is, to gather: and
so it might allude to that, (...)
whereunto our Savior in the Gospel, resembles his compassion toward the
Jews, of a hen gathering her chickens under her wings. Matthew. 23.37.
But it is here rather translated by taking up, as the word very usually
signifies. 1. And it seems to resemble the state of young infants, by the
unnatural parents exposed to the wide world, (as we read Cyrus, and Romulus,
and some others, both in Fables and Histories, to have been:) where they must
have perished, if some good body had not taken pity of them, and taken them up.
Joh. 5.5 -- 7.
2. Or the state of some impotent neglected Cripple, like him that lay before
the pool of Bethesda, and had neither limbs to put himself into the water, nor
any friend to help him in: 3. Or the travailer in the Parable Luke 10. that lay
in the highway wounded by thieves half dead; Luke 10.30. -- 35.
where he must have died outright, if the Samaritan passenger had not taken him
up, and taken order for his tending and recovery.

17. The plain meaning is, that though our Fathers and Mothers though all other
friends and comforts fail us; because they either can not, or will not help us:
yet our heavenly Father never does, nor will fail or forsake those that put
their trust in him. Yea rather, then is his providence nearest, and his help
readyest, when we are most forsaken of others, and left most destitute of all
worldly succor. Whence it is, that so often in the Psalms, to procure readier
help from God, David alleges it as a forcible argument, that he was a
desolate and forsaken man. Psalm. 10.14.
(The poor commits himself to thee, for thou art a helper of the
friendless. O go not far from me; for trouble is nigh at hand, -- 22.11.
and there is none to help and many the like. And how often does the Lord
himself, -- 108.12.
(whose general providence watches over all men, yea even all creatures,)
profess himself yet in a more special manner to be the Father of the
fatherless; and to have a special care of the widow, the poor, Psalm.
68.5.146.9.
and the stranger above others: as being more destitute of worldly succor and
friends, -- 145 14. -- 146.8.9 -- 147.9,
then others are. In three Psalms together you have The Lord upholdeth all
those that fall, and lifts up all those that be down. In the 146. The Lord
helps them that are fallen; the Lord cares for the stranger, He defends
the fatherless and widow. In the 147. He feeds the young ravens that call
upon him. The observation is common, that he instanceth in So Job 38.41. Mat.
6.26. Luke 12.24.
the raven, rather then in any other bird: because of all other birds the
ravens are observed (...)* Arist. 6 hist. animal. 6. See Aelian. 2.49. Plin.
10.12.
soonest to forsake their young ones. Whether the observation hold or no, it
serves to my purpose howsoever: for if God so sufficiently provide for the
young ravens, when the dams forsake them: will he not much more take Fathers and
Mothers forsake us? Are not we (stamped with his own image,) much more valuable
with him, then many ravens.

18. But dictum factum: These are but words: are there producible any deeds to
make it good? Verily there are: and that to the very letter. Genesis 21.19.
When Ismaels Mother despairing of his life had forsaken him, and laid him down
gasping (his last, for ought she knew, or could do to help it,) in the
wilderness; the Lord took him up: He opened a new spring of water, and opened
her eyes to see it: and so the child was preserved Genesis 21. When Moses also had
forsaken him (for they durst not stand by him any longer) and laid him down
among the rushy flags; the Lord took him up too. Exodus 2.6. -- 9.
He provided him of a Savior, the Kings own daughter; and of a nurse, the
child's own mother: and so he was preserved too. Take but two Examples more, out
of either Testament one; David and S. Paul: both forsaken of men, both taken up
of God. How was David forsaken in Psalm. 142.5. when he had looked upon his
right hand, and saw no man that would know him, he had no place to fly unto,
and no man cared for his soul. But all the while Dominus a dextris: there was
one at his right hand (though at first he was not aware of him,) ready to take
him up: As ver. 6. I cried unto thee O Lord: thou art my hope and my portion in
the land of the living. And how S. Paul was forsaken, take it from himself 2 Timothy 4.16. At my first answer no man stood with me, but all forsook me. A heavy
case: and had been heavier, had there not been one ready to take his part, at
the next verse, Nevertheless the Lord stood by me and strengthened me etc. What
need we any more witnesses? In ore duorum, In the mouth of two such witnesses,
the point is sufficiently established.

19. But you will yet say, These two might testify what they post-factum. But
David in the Text pronounces de futuro before hand, and that somewhat
confidently. The Lord will take me up. As he does also elsewhere; Sure I am
that the Lord will avenge the poor, Psalm. 140.12.
and maintain the cause of the helpless. Psalm. 140. But is there any ground for
that? Doubtless there a double ground; one in the nature, another in the
promise of God. In his Nature four Qualities there are, (we take leave so to
speak, sutably to our own low apprehensions; for in the Godhead there are
properly no Qualities:) but call them Qualities, or Attributes, or what else
you will; there are four perfections in God, opposite to those defects, which
in our earthly Parents we have found to be the chief causes why they do so often
forsake us: which give us full assurance that he will not fail to take us up,
when all other succors fail us. Those are his Love, his Wisdom, his Power,
his Eternity: all in his Nature. To which four add his Promise; and you have
the fullness of all the assurance that

20. First, the Love of our heavenly Father toward all mankind in general,
but especially toward those that are his children by adoption and grace; is
infinitely -- tam pater nemo: tam pius nemo. Tertul de poenit. cap. 9.
beyond the Love of earthly Parents toward their children. They may prove
unnatural, (...): their bowels may be crusted up against the fruit of their own
body. But the Lord cannot but love his people. He can as well cease to be, as
to love: for he is love. If he should deny that, he should deny himself: and
that he will not do, 1 John 4.16.
because he cannot; and that he cannot do, because he will not. Potenter non It
is impossible for him, to whom all things are possible, to deny himself. The
Church indeed, out of the sense of her pressures, lets fall complaints
sometimes as if she were forsaken: 2 Timothy 2.13.
( But Syon said, the Lord has forsaken me, and my God has forgotten me, Esaias
49.14.) But she complains without cause; it is a weakness in her, to which
during her warfare she is subject by fits: but she is checked for it
immediately, in the very next verse there, Can a woman forget her sucking
child etc. Yea they may forget: yet will not I forget thee.

21. Again, their Love may be alienated by needless jealousies, his Love is
durable; he loves his own unto the End. Joh. 13.1.
He knows the singleness of their Hearts, and will receive no accusation
against them. Quis accusabit? Who dare lay any thing to the charge of his
Elect, Romans 8.33.
when he stands up for their Justification? They alas are negligent enough;
unthankful, undutiful children: nay (confessed it must be) other while stubborn
and rebellious. But as David's heart longed after Absolon, because he was his
son, 2 Samuel 14.1.
though a very ungracious one: Luke 15.21.
so his bowels yearn after those that are no ways worthy (but by his dignation
only) to be called his sons. Forgiving all their miscarriages upon their true
repentance; receiving them with gladness, though they have squandred away all
their portion with riotous living, if they return to him in any time with
humble, -- 13.
obedient, and perfect hearts, and in the mean time using very many
admonitions, entreaties, and other artifices to win them to repentance; and
forbearing them with much patience; that they space enough to repent in. Apoc.
2.21.
And if upon such indulgencies and insinuations they shall come in; he will not
only welcome them with kind embraces, but do his part also to hold them in,
when they are even ready to fly out again, and were it not for that hold,
would in all likelihood so do. So as, unless by a total wilful renouncing him
they break from him, and cut themselves off, nothing in the world shall be able
to separate them from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. Romans
8.39.


22. Yet again, Parents affections may be so strongly biased another way, (as
we heard) that in the pursuit of other delights, forget or very much dis-regard
their children. But no such thing can befall our heavenly Father; who takes
pleasure in his people, Psalm. 149.4. -- 35.27. Mic. 7.18. Deuteronomy. 10.15.
and in their prosperity: whose chiefest delight is in showing mercy to his
children, and doing them good. [ The Lord had a delight in thy fathers to love
them, Deuteronomy. 10.] And whereas the Church (as we also heard) is apt to complain,
Esaias 49.14. -- 62.4.
that she is forsaken and desolate: the Lord by the Prophet gives her a most
comfortable assurance to the contrary, Esaias 62. Thou shall no more be called
forsaken, -- etc. But thou shall be called Hephzibah. -- (It is a compound
word, and signifies as much as My delight is in her: and so the reason of For
the Lord delights in thee. That for his Love; the first Attribute.

23. His Wisdom is the next. Fathers and mothers (through humane ignorance)
cannot perfectly understand the griefs of their children; nor infallibly know
how to remedy them, if they did. But God, who dwells in light, nay, who is
light, knows the inmost recesses, 1 Timothy 6.16. 1 John 1.5.
the darkest thoughts and secrets of all men's hearts, better then themselves
do. He perfectly understands all their wants, and what supplies are fittest
in their respective conditions, with all the least circumstances thereunto
belonging. When all the wits and devices of men are at a loss, and know not
which way in danger, to prevent that mischief, to effectuate any design: the
Lord by his infinite wisdom can manage the business with all advantage for the
good o^ his children if he see it behoveful for them; bringing it about
suavi^er and fortiter, sweetly and without violence in ordering the means, but
effectually and without fail in accomplishing the end.

24. Which wisdom of his, observable in all the dispensations of his gracious
providence toward his children; we may behold (as by way of instance) in his
fatherly corrections: As the Apostle Heb. 12. makes the comparison between the
different proceedings of the fathers of our flesh, Heb. 12.9. -- 10.
and the Father of spirits, in their chastisements. They do it after their own
pleasure, says he: that is, not always with judgment, and according to the
merit of the fault; but after the present disposition of their own passions,
either through fond indulgence sparing the rod too much, or in a frantic rage
laying it on without mercy or measure. But it is not so with him: who in all
his chastisements has an eye, as to our former faults, (such is his justice;)
so also and especially to our future profit, (such is his mercy:) and orders
all accordingly. His blessings are our daily food: his corrections our physic.
Our frequent surfeiting on that food brings on such distempers, that we must
be often and sometimes soundly physickt, or we are but lost men. As therefore a
skilful Physician attempereth and applies his remedies with such due regard to
the present state of the Patient, as may be likeliest to restore him to a good
habit of body and consistency of health: so heavenly Father with us. But with
this remarkable difference. The other may err in judging of the state of the
body, or the nature of the ingredients, in his proportions of mixture; in the
dose, and many other ways: But the Lord perfectly knows how it is with us,
and what will do us good, and how much, and when, and how long to continue,
etc. and proceeds in every respect thereafter.

25. Thirdly, whereas our earthly parents have a limited, and that a very
narrow power, and cannot therefore do their children power is, Psalm. 147.5.
(as his wisdom,) infinite. Not limited by any thing, but his own blessed will:
( quicquid voluit fecit; as for our God he is in heaven, Psalm. 135.6. -- 115.3.
he has done whatsoever pleased him.) Not hindered by any resistance, or
retarded by any impediments: ( quis restitit? Who has resisted his will? Romans
9.) Not disabled by any casualties, occurrences, Romans 9.19.
or straitness of time: ( adjutor in opportunitatibus, Psalm. 9.) Even a refuge
in due time of trouble. That is his due time commonly, Psalm. 9.9.
(dominus in monte) when it seems too late to us, Genesis 22.14.
and when things are grown in the eye of reason almost desperate and
remediless. The lay to his hand, is, Psalm. 119.116
when (to our apprehensions) his law is even quite destroyed; when men have
fallen upon most cursed designs, trampled all laws of God and men under their
feet, and prospered. And here indeed is the right trial of our faith, Romans
4.18. -- 20.
and whether we be the true children of faithful Abraham: if we can hope beyond
and against hope: That is, if we can rest our faith entirely upon the power and
providence of God; not staggering (through unbelief) at any promise, seem it
never so unlikely: and continue steadfast in our holy obedience to the will of
God, not staggering (through disobedience) at any command, seem it never
Abraham did both: and out of this reason, as the Apostle rendereth it, Romans 4.
because he was firmly grounded in this persuasion of the power of God, -- 21.
that what he had promised he was able also to perform.

26. The last attribute proposed is Gods Eternity. Our Fathers and Mothers,
where are they? and do Prophets, or Princes, Zach. 1.5.
or any sort of men live for ever? They all pass like a shadow, wither as and
are driven away as the Grasshopper. When they must go, they cannot help
themselves: and when they are gone, they cannot help us. They are mortal men;
he the immortal God: they are dying men; he the living God. Life is one of his
prerogatives Royal. All other things that partake of life in any degree, have
but a derived life, and ^uch as either shall have an end, or at least had a
beginning. God alone has life in and of himself: and his life alone is
measured, not by Time, but Eternity. He is therefore said to inhabit Eternity.
He lifts up his hand, (when he swears by himself having no greater to swear
by, Esaias 57.15. Deuteronomy. 32.40. Psalm. 102.12. -- 27.
) and says, Behold I live

27. And therefore, when our Fathers and Mothers and friends forsake us,
because either their Love fails, or their skill fails, or their power
fails, or their life fails: our heavenly Father, who wants neither love,
nor wisdom, nor power, nor life, but is infinite in all; we may rest assured,
is every way accomplished to succor us at all assayes, and to take us up. And
that he will engage all these for our relief, if we will but cast our selves
wholly upon him; we have his gracious promise in the last place, to fill up
spiritual graces and comforts, necessary for the everlasting salvation of our
souls: but also to provide and furnish us with all the good things, and to
preserve and deliver us from all the evils of this life; so far as in his
excellent wisdom he shall see it conducing to his glory, 1 Timothy 4.8.
the weal of his Church, and the salvation of his chosen.

28. The particular promises are many, and lie scattered every in the holy
Scriptures: whence every man may gather them for his own use, as his occasions
require. I shall mention but that one general Promise, which though delivered
first to Joshua in Heb. 13. as a ground of such general duties as are common to
all Christians; Deuteronomy. 31.8. Jos. 1.5. Heb. 13.5.
and fitteth as properly as any other to the present argument: namely this, I
will not fail thee, nor forsake thee. He promises, that whosoever else fails
us, yet he will not: all one with what is here presumed in the Text by David.
And having promised it, we were very Infidels, if we should doubt whether he
will perform it or no. It were to question his wisdom; as if he had not
considered what he promised when he passed his word: to question his Love; as
if he would not be as good as his word: to question Power, as if he could not
be as big as his word.

29. Having therefore such Promises, dearly beloved, it behooves us to be very
wary, when troubles lie long and heavy upon us, that we complain not too
distrustfully, as if God had quite forsaken us. And the rather, because it is
an infirmity incident to an infirmity, and so confessed by them. Has God
forgotten to be gracious? etc. David's complaint in Psalm 77. Psalm. 77.7 -- 9.
But presently acknowledging it an Error, he corrects himself for it, in the
immediate following words, And I said, it is mine infirmity. We by his example,
-- 10.
early to silence all tumultuous thoughts and secret murmurings of our evil
hearts, which are so ready to charge God foolishly, and to break out into
unseasonable complaints against his most wise and holy dispensations: Job 1.22.
and that by meditating effectually upon the Attributes and Promises aforesaid.
Who so confidently professes himself to trust in God, (as almost forsaken him,
(as very many do:) either makes God a liar, or bewrays himself (in some
degree) an Hypocrite. He makes God a liar, if he say God has forsaken him,
when he has not: and he bewrays some Hypocrisy in himself, if he say he
puteth his trust in God, when he does not.

30. And as it becomes us not, to be too querulous for the present; so neither
secondly, to be too solicitous for the future. I forbid not to any, but require
rather in every man, a moderate provident care, for the getting, keeping, and
disposing of the things of lawful means; still leaving the success entirely to
the good pleasure of our heavenly father. But sure, did we firmly believe that
his care over us is no whit lesser, but rather infinitely greater then that of
our earthly Parents: we would not suffer our selves to be disquieted with
perplexed thoughts, nor our spirits to be vexed with distrustful anxieties
about the future success of our affairs. Children, whilst they are in their
fathers house, and at their finding, use not to trouble themselves with such
thoughts as these, What shall we eat? or what shall we drink? or wherewith
shall we be clothed? Matthew. 6.31.
but leave that their father, to whose care it properly belongs. We are very
meanly persuaded of our heavenly fathers affection toward us, and of his care
over us, -- 32.
if we dare not trust him as securely for our daily provisions; who knows
that we stand in need of all these things, about which we so needlessly trouble
our selves. Enough it is for us, Phil. 4.6.
in all things by supplications and prayers for what we want, and thanksgivings
for what we have, 1 Pet. 5.7. Psalm. 55.22.
to let our requests be made known unto him; and then to be careful for nothing
any farther, but to cast all our care and our burden upon him: and doubtless he
will not suffer us to lie and perish; but will take us up, take care of us, and
nourish us.

thirdly let us droop, or be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow, as if some
strange thing had befallen us; upon the fail of any earthly helps or hopes
whatsoever. If our Fathers and Mothers affection be not toward us, as we think
it should; if they have entertained worse thoughts of us, then we deserve; if
they have not discretion and foresight to give us meet and orderly education,
want, or otherwise disabled from doing for us what formerly they intended, or
we expected; if they be taken from us, before we be grown up: If our friends
whom we trusted have proved unfaithful, and shrunk from us when we had use of
them; if those proportions of wealth, honor, reputation, liberty, or
whatsoever other worldly conveniences and contentments we have formerly
enjoyed, be pared away to very little, or even to nothing: we have yet one
reserve, Heb. 6.19.
that we dare rest surely upon; one anchor of hope that will hold in despite
of all the World; even the goodness and faithfulness Lord God. To him have we
been left ever since we were born: Psalm. 22.10.
and he has not hitherto failed nor forsaken us, but has preserved us in
being; in such a being, as he who best knows what is fit, has thought fit
for us. It is our fault, if this experience of the time past do not breed in us
hope for the time to come, Romans 5.4.5.
and that a lively hope, a hope that will never shame either him or us: Psalm.
48.14.
even this, That he Will also be our guide unto death; that he will not fail us
or forsake us henceforth for ever; but will preserve us still in such a
condition as he shall see good for us. 2 Cor. 4.9.
Persecuted we may be and afflicted; but forsaken we shall not be.

Luke 21.19.
32. We ought therefore to possess our souls in patience, whatsoever shall
betide us in the World: and not to consult with flesh and blood, in seeking to
relieve our selves in our distresses, by engaging in any unworthy or
unwarrantable practice; or by siding, partaking, or but basely complying with
the workers of wickedness, that we may eat of their dainties. Is it possible we
should be so ill advised, Psalm. 141.4.
as* to think to escape the storm when it approaches toward us, by making
shipwreck of a good conscience. If we go after lying vanities, Jonah 2.8.
(and such are all creatures: all men liars, all things vanity:) do we not ipso
facto forsake our own mercy, and wilfully bring ruin heavenly Father, as young
birds do to their dam, for succor. He will gather us under his wings, Psalm.
91.4.
and we shall be safe under his feathers: his faithfulness and truth shall be
our shield and buckler. If we commit our ways to him; 37.5.
cast our selves upon him by a through relyance; resign all our desires,
wills, and interests into his hands: he will certainly bring to pass, aut quod
volumus, aut quod malumus, either what we like best, or what he knows is best.

33 Only let us resolve to perform our part; do faithfully what commands,
shun carefully what he forbids, suffer patiently what he inflicteth: and we
may then be confident, he will perform his part to the uttermost. That when all
the World forsakes us, he will take us up: take us into his care and
protection here; and, if by patient continuance in well-doing we seek it, Romans
2.7.
take us up at the last glory, and honor, and immortality, and eternal life,
which his only beloved Son has purchased, and his ever-blessed Spirit
consigned to all them that love him, and put their trust in his mercy. To that
only beloved Son, and ever-blessed Spirit, together with the eternal Father,
three persons and one undivided Trinity; be rendered by us and the whole
Church, all the kingdom, the power, and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.


Luke 16.8. -- For the children of this world are in their generation wiser
then the children of Light.


1. THe foregoing verses contain a Parable: this, the Application of it. The
Parable that of the unjust Steward: a faithless, and a thriftless man. Verse. 1.
He had wronged his master, without any benefit to himself: as prodigals are
wont, to do other men harm, and themselves no good. The master, coming (at
length, and -- Dedecus ille domus sciet ultimus. Juven. Satyr. 10. Verse. 2.
with the last) to have some knowledge of his false-dealing; discharges him
his office, and calls on him to give in his accounts. The Steward, awakened
with that short and unexpected warning, began now to think in good earnest,
what before he never thought of to purpose, what should become of him and his
for the future: he knew not which way in the world to turn himself to get a
living, Verse. 3.
when he should be turned out of service. He had not been so provident before
hand, to live upon: He could not frame to handle a spade, he had not been
brought up with pains-taking: And for him that had so long born sway in such a
house, (and like enough with insolence enough,) now to run craving a small
piece of money of every traveller by the highway, or stand at another man's
door begging a morsel of bread; shame, and a stout heart would not suffer him
to think of that. Well, something he must do, and that speedily too, or starve.
He therefore casts about this way, and that way, and every way: and at last
bethinketh himself of a course, and resolves upon it; to show his Verse. 4.
that should make amends for all, and do his whole business. He therefore
sends for his Masters debtors forthwith; Verse. 5 -- 7*
abateth them of their several sums, and makes the books a ^ree* in hope, that
having gratified so many persons by such large ^batements; some of them would
remember it sure, (though others should prove ungrateful,) and make him some
part of requital for the same. The Master vexed to see himself so palpably
cheated, and knew not how to help it (for he could require no more of the
debtors, then was upon the foot of their Bills:) could not yet but commend the
man's wit howsoever. And the Lord commended the unjust steward, because he had
done wisely, in the former

2. Having thus framed the body of the parable; our Savior now gives it a
soul, in this latter part of the verse: breaths into it the breath of life,
by applying it. Application is the life of a Parable. The commending of the
stewards wisdom, was with the purpose to recommend the example to us: that we
might from it learn, to provide against the time to come, as he did; and that
also by such like means, as he did. So that the Application has two parts. The
one more general, respecting the End: that as he was careful to provide
maintenance, for the preservation of his natural so we should be careful to
make provision for our souls, that we may attain to everlasting life. The
other, more special, respecting the Means: that as he provided for himself out
of his Masters goods, by disposing the same into other hands, and upon several
persons: so we should lay up for our selves a good foundation toward the
attainment of everlasting life, 1 Timothy 6.18, 19
out of the unrighteous Mammon wherewith God has entrusted us; by being rich
in good works, communicating and distributing some of that in our hands toward
the necessities of others. Of the temporals we here enjoy, we are not to
account our selves proprietaries, but stewards, and such accountable. It should
be our wisdom therefore, (as it will be our happiness,) to dispose them into
other hands by almsdeeds and other charitable works, and so to improve these
temporals, (which we cannot properly call our own) to our own spiritual eternal
advantage. That later and more special application is in the next verse, [ Make
you friends of the unrighteous Mammon, etc.] The words proposed contain the
more general application, (our business at this time,) delivered here by way of
comparison; a way more effectual (ordinarily) to provoke endeavor, then bare
exhortations are. For the children of this world are in their generation wiser,
then the children of light.

3. In which comparison, there are observable; first and secondly, as the terms
of the comparison, two sorts of persons distinguished either from other by
their several appellations, and compared the one The children of this world, on
the one part; and the children of light, on the other: between these the
question is, whether sort is wiser. Thirdly, the sentence or judgment given
upon the question; clearly on behalf of the former sort: they are pronounced
the wiser ( -- The children of this world wiser then the children of light.)
Lastly, the limitation of the sentence, how far forth it is to be understood.
They wiser; true: but then you must take it right* wiser in their generation,
not simply and absolutely wiser. Of which in order.

4. The persons are, children of this world, and children of light: (...) both,
sons or children. That is terminus convenientiae: country, profession,
quality, or condition, are by an usual Hebraism in the Scriptures expressed by
this word children with some addition thereunto: as children of Edom, children
of the Prophets, children of death. From the Hebrews, other languages have by
derivation entertained the same Pleonasm: as (...) so frequent in Homer, filii
medicorum, and the like. In the Scriptures it is very usual, both in the good
part, and in the bad. John 8.39. Mat. 11.19. Romans 9.26. 1 Samuel 10.27. Ephesians.
5.6. Matthew. 23.15.
In the good part, you have children of Abraham, children of wisdom, children
of God: in the evil part children of Belial, children of disobedience, hell.
Here are both: Children of the World, and Children of Light.

5. For the World first; the Greeks have two words for it, (...) and (...): the
one, importing more properly the frame of the creatures; the other, some space
or duration of time rather. That propriety is not always observed by writers;
yet here it is: for the word is (...), and has respect unto Time. Next whereas
it is said [ this World,] that implies there is another; set oppositely
against this: distinguished Luke 20. by (...) and (...), Luke 10.34, 35. Ephesians.
1.20. Matthew. 12.32.
this world, and that world: otherwhere by (...), and (...), or by that now is,
and the world to come. Again, this world so taken, (to wit, as it stands
distinguished from that world, or the world to come,) is yet capable to be
understood in a double notion. For it may be taken either in a more general
sense, with respect to the common affairs of this life, without difference of
good or bad: as it is taken in that place of Luke The children of this world
marry, and are given in marriage: but they that shall be counted worthy of that
world etc.) The children of this world, that is, men that live here on earth,
whilst here they live: and the children of that world, they that hereafter
shall live for ever in heaven. Or it may be taken in a narrower and more
restrained sense, as the world is opposed and contra-distinguished to the
Church. And the opposition of the children of this world, to the children of
light shows it must be so taken here: in effect as if he said, 1 Thessalonians. 5.5.
the children of darkness. Those then are the children of this world here
meant, who as subjects serve under the 2 Cor. 4.4. Romans 13.12.
the God of this world; live in the works of darkness, the employment of this
world; and when they dye, (unless God in special mercy deal otherwise with
them, and that will not be done but upon the condition supposed, that of their
repentance, Matthew. 25.30.
) shall be cast into outer darkness at the end of the world.

6. And this title we may conceive to belong unto them in a threefold respect:
in as much as 1. their affections are bent upon this world; 2. their
conversations are conformed to this world; and 3. their portion is allotted
them in this world. First, children of this world, for that their affections
are wholly set upon the world. tanquam in alieno, as strangers and pilgrims in
a foreign, 1 Pet. 2.11.
(yea in the enemies) country: and they look upon the world, and are looked
upon by it, as strangers; and are used by it accordingly. Joh. 15.19.
If they were of the world, the world would own them, and love them, as her own
party: and they would also love the world again, as their own home. But because
they are not of the world, (though they be in it;) but are denizons of heaven,
((...) Phil. 3.) therefore the world hates them: Phil. 3.20.
and they on the other side are weary of the world, and long after heaven,
their treasure is laid up, and where their hearts and affections also are. Mat.
6.20, 21.
Like an English factor in Turkey, that has some dealings there; if not rather
like an English captive, that is held prisoner there: but still professes
himself a subject of England, and his heart and desires are there. But the
Children spoken of here in the Text are in the world tanquam in proprio, as in
their own country, at their own homes, where (if they might) they would
willingly set up their rest for ever. As Socrates being asked what Countryman
he was, answered that he was (...), that is, a Citizen of the world: so (but in
another, and a the world, as bad as it is, and settle their hearts and
affections so entirely thereupon: saying as S. Peter did, when he said he knew
not what, Mark 9.6.
bonum est esse hic, It is good being here. Their souls cleave to the world:
and it is death to them to part from it.

Affections: so secondly children of this world in respect of their
Conversation. (...), says the Apostle: fashion not your self, after this
present world. Romans 12.2.
The godly being changed in the renewing of their minds, do not fashion
themselves according to this present evil world: But as at their baptism they
renounced the world, with all the pomps, lusts and vanities of it: so they take
themselves bound in the whole course of their lives to be as unlike the evil
world as they can, by walking in all holiness and purity of conversation. So
long as they continue in this vale of misery, and live here in the world, they
must have to do in the (and the world will have to do with them;) and daily
occasions they shall have for the necessities of this life, to use the things
of this world. But then they are careful so to use them, as neither to abuse
themselves, nor them. Psalm. 84.6.
Going through the vale of misery, they use it for a well; drawing out thence a
little water (as occasions require) for their needful refreshing: but they will
take care withal, to drain it well from the mud; to keep themselves (so far as
is possible) unspotted with the world, and to escape the manifold pollutions
and defilements that are in the world through lust. But the children here
spoken of, Jam. 1.27.
immerse and ingulfe themselves this world with all greediness: walking (as the
Apostle expresses it Ephesians. 2.) after the course of this world, according to the
prince of the power of the air, in the lusts of the flesh, Ephesians. 2.2, 3.
doing the will of the flesh and of the mind. There is a combination (you see)
of our three great Spiritual Enemies, The Devil, the Flesh, and the World,
against us; and these three agree in one; to undo us, and to destroy us. Now
he that yields to the temptations of the Devil, or makes provision for the
Flesh to fulfill it in the lusts thereof, Romans 13.14.
or suffers himself to be carried with the sway of the world to shape his
course thereafter; preferring his own will a child of this world in respect of
his conversation.

8. Thirdly, the children of this world are so called in regard their Portion
is in this world. The children of light content themselves with any small
pittance which it pleases their heavenly father to allow them here: being
assured they shall be provided for with so much as shall be sufficient for them
to maintain them during this their minority with a kind of subsistence. But
the main of their portion, their full childs-part, their rich and precious
inheritance, they expect not in this world. They well know it is laid up for
them ((...), there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness: 1 Timothy 4.8. 1
Pet. 1.4, 5.
) reserved in the heavens) and that in safe hands ( kept by the power of God,)
till they be grown up to it. As Joseph gave his brethren provision for their
journey; but the full sacks were tied up, not to be opened till they were
gotten home. Genesis 42.25. Psalm. 16.5, 119.57.
Indeed rather, God himself is their portion: both here in part, and hereafter
in full. But the children we now speak of, if there goodness, or usefulness
in them, by the superabundant bountifulness of a gracious God in any respect or
degree rewardable: Mat. 6.2, etc.
habent mercedem. They have all they are like to have, in hand: there is
nothing for them, neither (for the most part) do they expect any thing, Psalm.
17.14.
in reversion. Which have their portion in this life, says David, Psalm 17. If
they have done him any small piece of service, though unwittingly; they shall
have their wages for it paid them to the uttermost: as Nebuchadnezzar had Egypt
assigned him, as his wages for the service he did against Tyrus. If they be but
bastard-sons, they shall yet have their portions of right, or pretend to as by
desert. But yet in this world only: The heavenly inheritance in the world to
come, Ezekiel. 29.18, 1^.
which is to descend unto the right heir when he comes to age, is preserved
for the legitimate children only, such as are become the sons of God by faith
in Christ Jesus. Gal. 3.26. Genesis 25.5, 6.
As Abraham gave gifts to the sons of his Concubines, and sent them away; and
so we hear no more of them, nor of any thing their father did for them
afterward: but Isaac in fine carried the inheritance, though he had not so
much, as the other had in present.

9. Those are the children of this world: but the children of light, Light, as
it is metaphorically used in the Scriptures; or pursue the resemblances between
the metaphorical and spiritual light, and the natural. To our purpose briefly;
Light is either spoken of God, or of the things of God. First, God himself is
light: a most pure, clear, and simple light; without the least allay or mixture
of darkness. God is light, and in him is no darkness, says S. John. The Father
of lights, 1 John 1.5. James 1.17.
without so much as the least shadow of turning, says S. James. the father of
lights: it cannot be unprop^r, that his children be styled (...), the children
of light.

10. Next, the Word of God, that is a light too. Thy word is a light unto my
feet, Psalm. 119.105.
Psalm. 119. So called from the effect: because when it goes forth, it gives
light and understanding to the simple. The Law, -- 130.
which is but a darker part of that word, enlighteneth yet the eyes, -- 198.
Prove. 6.23. 2 Pet. 1.19.
Psalm. 19. Lex lux. The Prophecies, the darkest part of all, yet are not
without some degree of luster: they shine, says S. Peter, though but as a
candle in a dark place. But then the light of the Gospel, 2 Cor. 4.4.
glorious light, shining forth as the Sun when he is in his greatest strength
at noon day in Summer.

11. Hence also arises (as one light commonly begets another,) a third
light: the light of grace and saving knowledge, wrought in the hearts of men by
the holy word of God, (set on holy Spirit withal, accompanying it.) God, who
brings light out of darkness, has shined in your hearts, 2 Cor. 4.6.
to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus
Christ. 2 Cor. 4.

12. And where the light of grace is, there is another light also fourthly,
that always attends thereupon, the light of comfort. For Grace and Comfort
are Twins: the blessed inseparable effects of one and the same blessed Spirit.
Lux orta est justo: there is sprung up, (or as some translate it; Psalm. 97.11.
there is sown) a light for the righteous, and joyful gladness for such as be
true hearted, Psalm. 97. The true heart, that is the light heart indeed. Light
in both light, without darkness; and light without sadness or heaviness.

13. There is yet remaining a fifth light; the light of Glory. Darkness is an
emblem of horror. We have not a fitter similitude, whereby to express the
miseries of the hell within us, (that of an evil conscience,) or of the hell
without us (that of eternal torments) then by inner and outer darkness. But
light is a most glorious creature: then which, none fitter to express to our
capacities, either the infinite incomprehensible glory and majesty of God, ( He
clotheth himself with light as with a garment; Psalm. 104.2. 1 Timothy 6.16.
and dwells in the light) or that endless glory and happiness which the holy
Angels do now, and all the Saints in their due time shall enjoy, in heaven,
Col. 1.12.
( -- Who has made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in
light. Col. 1.

14. In these respects, he that has the honor to be styled a Christian in any
degree, has also a title so far forth to be styled a child of light. Whether
it be by the outward profession of the Christian faith only: or by the inward
sanctification of the Spirit also. Those are nomine tenus Christiani,
Christians but in name and show; equivocal Christians: these only are
Christians indeed and in Of these is made up the Church of Gods elect,
otherwise called the invisible Church of Christ, and not unfitly; because the
persons appertaining to that Church as members thereof, are not distinguishable
from others by any outward infallible character visible to us, but by such
secret and inward impresses as come not within the cognizance of any creature,
nor can be known by any creature otherwise then conjecturally only, without
special revelation from God. The foundation of God stands firm, having this
seal, (Dominus novit,) The Lord knows who are his. Should we take these here
meant; the opposition between the children of this world, 2 Timothy 2.19.
the children of light, would be most perfect. Those who remain in the state of
depraved nature, and so under the dominion of Sin and Satan, being the children
of this world in the strictest notion: and those whom God has called out of
darkness into his mavelous light; that is, brought out of the state of nature
into the state of grace, and translated into the kingdom of his Son Jesus
Christ, being the children of light in the stricter notion also.

15. But forasmuch as we, who cannot look beyond the outside, are no competent
judges of such matters: it will best become us to make use of that judgment,
which alone God has allowed us; I mean, that of Charity. And then it will be
no hard business for us to pronounce determinately, (applying the sentence even
to particular persons) who are to be esteemed the children of light. Even all
those, that by outwardly professing the name and faith of Christ, are within
the pale of the visible Church of Christ. The holy Apostle so pronounces of
them all, 1 Thessalonians. 5. Ye are all the children of the light, 1 Thessalonians. 5.5. Ephesians.
5.8.
and of the day, And Ephesians. 5. Ye were sometimes our very baptism entitleth us
hereunto, which is the sacrament of our initiation: whereby we put on Christ,
Gal. 3.27.
and are made members of Christ and children of God. Whence it is, that in the
Greek Fathers Baptism is usually called (...), that is an enlightening; and
persons newly baptized (...); and (...) (an office in the Greek Church) to whom
it belonged to hear the confessions of the Catechumeni, and after they were
approved to present them to baptism: with many other phrases and expressions
borrowed from the same metaphor of light, and applied in like manner to
Baptism.

16. Now to bring all this long, (and, as I fear, tedious) discourse home to
the Text: the question here resolved seems, in the right stating thereof, to
come to this issue: whether natural and worldly men, in the managery of their
worldly affairs to the best temporal advantage; or they that profess themselves
Christians, in the business of their souls, and pursuit of everlasting
salvation; do proceed the more rationally and prudentially in their several
ways, toward the attainment of their several ends? How the question is
resolved, we shall consider by and by. In the mean time, from this very
consideration alone, that the children of light, and the stand in mutual
opposition one to the other, we may learn something that may be of use to us.
We would all be thought, (what I hope most of us are,) not nomine tenus only,
by outward profession, and at large, but in very deed and truth (...), good
Christians, and children of light in the stricter and nobler notion. Yet were
it but the other only; our very baptism and profession of Christianity would
oblige us to a holy walking, suitable to our holy calling and profession, and to
the solemn vow we took upon us at our baptism. It were a base, yea a very
absurd thing for us, to jumble and confound, what we find here not only
distinguished opposed against the one the other. Children of God and of the
Church by profession: and yet children of Satan and of the world in our
conversation? Children of light, and yet hold fellowship with, Ephesians. 5.11. 2
Cor. 6.14.
and take delight in, the unfruitful works says S. Paul. It astonished him,
that any man could think to bring things so contrary, as Light and Darkness, to
any good accord, or but tolerable compliance. When we were the children of this
world (and such we were as soon as we were born into the world:) by taking
Christendom upon us at our Baptism, we did ipso facto renounce the world, with
all the sinful pomps and vanities thereof, and profess our selves children of
the God of light. If now being made the children of God and of the light, we
shall again cast back a longing eye after the world, as Lots wife did after
Sodom; or Demas-like embrace this present world, Genesis 9.26. 2 Timothy 4.10.
ipso facto renounce our very Christendom, with all the blessed comforts and
benefits thereof; return with the dog to lick up our old vomit, and reduce our
selves to that our former wretched condition of darkness, from which we had so
happily escaped. 2 Pet.. 2.22.
Can any of us be so silly as to think the father of lights will own him for
his child, and reserve for him an inheritance in light; who flies out from
under his wing, and quite forsakes him to run after the Prince of darkness?
The Apostles motion seems very reasonable Ephesians. 5. that, whereas whilst we
were darkness, we walked as children of darkness, now we are become light in
the Lord, Ephesians. 5.8.
we should walk as The children of the world perfectly hate the light: why
should not the children of light as perfectly scorn the world? we have not so
much spirit in us, as we should have, if we do not; nor so much wisdom neither,
as we should have, if we do not; no, nor so much wisdom, as they have neither,
if we do not: and even hereby justify our Saviors doom in the comparison, and
yield, The children of this world wiser in their generations then we are. Which
is the next Point.

17. The justice of the sentence cannot be questioned, where the Judge that
gives it is beyond exception. Here he is so: so wise that he cannot be
deceived; so good, that he will not deceive. Mistaken he cannot be, (through
ignorance, or misinformation) in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom
and knowledge. If Solomon were able in a very intricate case to judge between
the two mothers: Col. 2.3.
shall not a greater then Solomon be able in a case of less difficulty, to give
a clear judgment between these two sorts of children? Nor was there any such
correspondence between our blessed Savior (the judge that pronounces sentence
in the Text) and the world; that we should suspect him at all inclinable to
favor that side. The world hated him: and a great part of the business he came
about, to condemn the world. If it could have stood with the integrity of so
righteous a Judge, to have favored either side: he that pronounced of himself
Ego sum lux, I am the light; Joh. 8.12.
would sure have leaned rather toward his own side, then toward the contrary
party, and so have pronounced sentence for the children of light; and not
against them. And that he should be awed with fear (as Judges too often are) to
transgress in judgment; there is of all other the least fear of that: since he
has not only vanquished the world in his own person ( Ego vici mundum, John
16.33.
John 16.) but has also enabled the meanest person that belongs to him and
believes in him, to do so too, [ This is the victory that overcomes the
world, 1 John 5.4.
even your faith, 1 John 5.]

18. It was not then either ignorance, or favor, or fear, or any thing else
imaginable, other then the truth and evidence of the thing it self, that could
induce him to give sentence on that side. Of the truth whereof, every days
experience ministers proof enough. worldly men in temporal matters, show their
wisdom, infinitely beyond what Christians usually do in spiritual things, very
many ways: handling their affairs, such as they are, for the compassing of
their own ends, such as they are, (to omit other particulars) with greater
sagacity, greater industry, greater cunning, greater unity (ordinarily) then
these do. Which particulars when we shall have a little considered for the
(...), to show the truth of the observation, and that so it is: we shall for
the (...), enquire into the reasons, thereof, and how it comes to be so.

19. First, they are very sagacious and provident, to forethink forecast how it
may be done: very wary and circumspect in their projects and contrivances, to
weigh all probable, and (as far as is possible) all possible inconveniences,
or whatsoever might impede or obstruct their designs, and to provide remedies
there-against. All Histories afford us strange examples in their several
kinds, of voluptuous beasts, who for the satisfying of their raging lusts; of
ambitious spirits, who for the grasping of a vast and unjust power; of
malicious and cruel men, who to glut themselves with blood and revenge, have
adventured upon very desperate and almost impossible attempts: and yet by the
strength of their wits have so laid the scene beforehand, and so carried on the
design all along; that they have very many times either wholly accomplished
what they intended, or brought their conceptions so near to the birth, that
nothing but a visible hand of an overruling providence from above, could
render them abortive. But omitting these (because I have yet much to go
through) I choose rather to instance in the worldling, of the lowest sphere
indeed, but best known by the name of a worldling; I mean the covetous wretch.
It were almost a wonder to consider, but that by common experience we find it
parts and breeding, of so thick a nostril that he can hardly be brought by any
discourse to be sensible of any thing that favors of religion, reason, or
ingenuity, should yet be so quick-sented where there is a likelihood of gain
toward, to smell it as speedily, and at as great a distance, Vulture does a
piece of carrion. Strange to see, what strange fetches and devices he can have
(the eagerness of his desires after the world sharpning his wits, and quickening
his invention) to hook in a good bargain: to enveigle and entangle his
necessitous neighbor, by some seeming kindness toward him in supplying his
present needs, till he have got a hanck over his estate: to watch the
opportunities for the taking up and putting off commodities to the most
advantage, to trench so near upon the laws, by engrossings, enhaunsings,
extortions, depopulations, and I know not how many other frauds and
oppressions, and yet to keep himself so out of reach, that the law cannot take
hold of him.

Secondly, the children of this world, as they are very provident and subtle
in forecasting; so are they very industrious and diligent in pursuing what they
have designed. Wicked men are therefore in the Scriptures usually called
Operarii iniquitatis, Workers of iniquity: because they do hoc agere, make it
their work, and their business, and follow it as their trade, Horat. 1. Epist.
2.
Vt jugulent homines, surgunt de nocte -- honest men lay them down in peace, and
take their rest, suspecting no harm because they mean none: thieves and robbers
are up and abroad, spreading their nets for the prey, and watching to do
mischievously. John 18.3. Matthew. 26.47. -- 38, etc.
They that were against Christ were stirring in the dead time of the night, and
marched with swords and staves to apprehend him: when they that were about him,
though bidden and chidden too, could not hold from sleeping two or three hours
before. Alaerius curru^t ad mortem, quam nos ad vitam Bernard. Matthew. 7.13.
Martyrs Diaboli: How slack we are to do God any service, how backward to
suffer any thing for him! and how they on the other side can bestir them to
serve the Devil, and be content to suffer martyrdom in his service. The way
sure is broad enough, and easy enough that leads to destruction: yet so much
pains is there taken to find it, that I verily believe half the pains many a
man takes to go to Hell, if it had been well bestowed, would have brought him
to Heaven.

21. Thirdly, the children of this world are mavelous cunning and close, to
carry things fair in outward show, so far as to hold up their credit with the
abused multitude, and to give a color to the cause they manage, be it never so
bad. Partly, by aspersing those that are otherwise minded then themselves are,
and dare not partake reproachful manner they please: wresting their most
innocent speeches and actions to an evil construction; and taking up any
slanders or accusations against them, whether true or false they matter not, so
they can but thereby render them odious to the world. Partly by their
hypocrisy, stealing away the hearts of well-meaning people from those to whom
they owe honor or subjection, and gaining reputation to themselves and their
Romans 16.) with fair speeches and specious pretenses; Romans 16.18.
the glory of God, the asserting of liberty, the propagation of the Gospel, the
reformation of abuses, Mark 12.40.
and the like. Right Pharisees: by their long-winded prayers, winding
themselves into the opinions of some, and estates of others. The main of their
care is (...), Gal. 6.12.
to set the fairest side forward; to enoile a rotten post with a glistering
varnish; and to make bright the outside of the vessel, Matthew. 23.25.
whatsoever nastiness there remains within. Thus the grand rebel Absolon, by
discrediting his fathers government, 2 Samuel 15.3. -- ^.
pretending to a great zeal of justice, and making reformation therein, if the
supreme power were settled upon him: did by little and little ingratiate himself
with the people (ever easily cheated into rebellion by such smooth pretenses;)
insensibly loosen them from the conscience of their bounden allegiance, and
having gotten together a strong party engaged them in a most unjust and
unnatural war, against his own father, and their undoubted Sovereign.

22. Lastly, the children of this world, the better to effectuate what they
have resolved upon, are at a marvelous great unity among themselves. They hold
all together, and keep themselves close. Psalm. 56.6. Job. 41.15. -- 17.
They stick together like burs: close as the scales of Leviathan. And although
they be not always all of one piece, but have their several aims, and act upon
different particular principles: yet Satan well knowing that if his kingdom
should be too much divided it could not stand, Luke 11.18.
makes a shift to patch them up so, as to make them Conciliant inter se
inimicissimas amicitias. Bern. sermon. 24. Luke 23.12. Mat. 16.1. Act. 17.18.
hang together to serve his turn, and to do mischief. Herod and Pilate, at some
odds before, must now be made friends: Pharisees and Sadduces, sectaries of
contrary opinions, and notoriously factious either against other, will yet
conspire to tempt Christ. The Epicurians and the Stoics, two sects of
Philosophers of all other the most extremely distant and opposite in their
Tenants Doctrines; came with their joint forces at Athens to encounter Paul,
and discountenance Christianity. And to molest and make havoc of the people of
God; the tabernacles of the Edomites and Ismaelites, the Moabites and the
Agarenes, Gebal, and Ammon and Amalek; Psalm. 83.5 -- 8.
with the rest of them (a Cento, and a rhapsody, of uncircumcised nations)
could lay their heads together with one consent, and combine themselves in
confederacies and associations Psalm. 83. Faciunt unitatem contra unitatem, To
destroy the happy unity that should be among brethren, they that were strangers
and enemies cursed unity among themselves.

23. Thus, whilst Christian men, who profess themselves children of light, by
their improvidence, sloth, simplicity, and disunion, too often suffer
themselves to be surprised by every weak assault, a prey both to their
spiritual and temporal enemies: the children of this world the while, by their
subtilty, industry, hypocrisy, and unity, do show themselves so much beyond
the other in all points of wisdom and prudence in their way: that we cannot but
subscribe to the (...), the truth of the sentence here pronounced by our
Savior; that certainly the children of this world are wiser (in their
generations) then the children of light.

24. But then for the (...); if we be not satisfied how it should come to pass,
that they are judged the wiser. For that, First, they have a very able Tutour
to direct them; Rev. 12.9.
the Old Serpent. belongs to the Serpent by kind; Genesis 3.1.
he has it by nature. ( Be ye wise as Serpents.) And that wisdom, Mat 10.16.
improved by the experience of some thousands of years, must needs increase,
and rise to a great proportion. Now this Old subtle serpent infuseth into the
children of this world, (who are in very deed his own children also, semen
serpentis, the seed of the serpent) some of his own spirit. Genesis 3.15.
(is not that it think you, which in 1 Cor. 2. is called Spiritus mundi, 1 Cor.
2.12.
the spirit of the world, and is there opposed to the spirit of God?) I mean,
some of his own serpentine wisdom. Not that wisdom which is from above; (that
is from another alloy, and is the only true wisdom indeed:) but that which is
from beneath, which S. James affirms to earthly, sensual, divelish. From this
infusion it is, Jam. 3.15.
that they do patrissare so right: having his example withal to instruct them
in all the Premises. Their providence in forecasting to do mischief, they
learn from him: he has his (...), and his (...) and his (...), his devises and
his methods, his sundry subtle artifices, 2 Cor. 2.11. Ephesians. 6.11. 2 Cor. 11.3.
in ordering his temptations with the most advantage to ensnare us. Their
unwearied diligence from him: who never rests compassing the earth, and going
to and fro in it, as a hungry lion hunting after prey. Their double cunning,
Job 1.7. 1 Pet. 5.8.
both in slaundering others, and disguising themselves; from him: who accuser
of others, to make them seem worse then they are, that he has his very name
from it, Rev. 12.10.
(...) (which in the primary signification of the word is no more then an
accuser;) and withal such a perfect dissembler, that to make himself seem
better then he is, 2 Cor. 11.14.
he can (if need be) transform himself into an Angel of light. Their unanimous
accord, from him: who though he have so many legions of cursed Angels under
him, yet keeps them together all at such unity among themselves, that they
never divide into factions and parties. By this infusion (to give you one
instance) he taught Judas to be so much wiser (as the world accounts wisdom,
and according to the notion wherein we now speak of it,) then his
fellow-Apostles: that whereas they rather lost by their master then gained,
having left all to follow him, Mark 10.28.
who had not so much as a house of his own wherein to harbor them; he played
his game so well, that he made benefit of him. He first got the keeping of the
bag, and out of that he got what the thief: John 12.6.
but because his gettings there could not amount to much, his Masters store
being not great, he thought he were as good make a handsome bargain once for
all, to bring him in a pretty lump together, and so sold his Master outright
for present money. Silly fellows, the eleven: this Puny, you see, outwitted
them all. But let him not impute it wholly to himself, or his own Mother-wit:
that it may appear to whom he was beholding for it, the story says, the Devil
put it into the heart of Judas to betray his Master. John 13.2.
And the infusion of that spirit of Satan was so strong in him, that it did
after a sort transform him into the same image: in so much as he called by his
name, ( Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a Devil?) Let all
Iudas-like traitors know (lest they be too proud, John 6.70.
and sacrifice to their own-wits) to whom they owe their wisdom.

25. But perhaps you will say, this consideration can weigh but little. For as
Satan by his spirit infuseth wisdom into the children of this world; so God by
his spirit infuseth wisdom into the children of light: and then, since the
spirit of God is stronger then the spirit of Satan, it should rather follow on
the contrary, that the wisdom of the children of light should exceed the wisdom
of the children of this world. The fullest answer hereunto would depend upon
the the limitation) which I shall have occasion to speak something unto anon:
to wit, that the wisdom of the children of this world, being but of a very base
metal in comparison, though it be more in bulk, is yet far less in value; as a
little Diamond may be more worth then a whole quarry of ragge.

26. But I answer rather, which is sufficient for the present, because it
leads us also to a second reason of the difference: That the spirit of God in
the children of light does not act ad ultimum sui according to the utmost of
his Almighty power; but according to the condition of the subject in whom he
works (leaving him, as a rational creature, to the freedom of his will; and
as a child of Adam, obnoxious to the carnal motions of original concupiscence)
and after the good pleasure of his own will withal. When Satan therefore
infuseth of his spirit into a man, he has this advantage, that he has all the
wisdom of the flesh to join with him readily, and to assist him, without any
thing within to make opposition there-against, and to counter-work the working
of that spirit, that it should not take effect: and so the work, meeting with
some help and no resistance, is soon done. Facilis descensus: as a ston^, when
it is set a going, tumbleth down the hill apace; or as a Boat that (having
wind and tide with it) runs glib and merrily down the stream. But when God
infuseth his spirit into a man, though that spirit (once entered) makes him
partly willing: yet is there in every child of Adam, so long as he lives
here, another inward principle still, which the Scriptures use to call by the
name of flesh, which lusts against the good spirit of God, and opposes it,
Gal 5.17.
and much weakneth the working of it. From whence it comes to pass that the
spirit of God works so slowly, and so imperfectly in us: like a ship adverso
flumine; much ado to tug it along against the current; or the stone which made
Sisyphus Saxum sudat ve^ sando, nec proficit hilum.
sweat to roll up the hill, although it tumbled down again always of it self.

27. Thirdly, since it is natural to most men (out of self-love) to make their
(...). Nazianz. Orat. 3.
own dispositions and thoughts, the measure whereby to other men's: hence it
comes to pass, that honest plain-dealing men, are not very apt, unless they
see apparent reason for it, to (...). Id. Orat. 21.
suspect ill of others. Because they mean well themselves, they are inclinable
to believe that all other men do so too. But men that have little truth or
honesty themselves, think all men to have as little: and so are full of fears
and jealousies, and suspicious of every body. Terent. Andr.
( Mala men's, malus animus.) Now this makes them stir up their own wits the
more, and bestir themselves with the greater endeavors; because they dare
trust no body else: and so they become the more cautelous and circumspect, the
more vigilant, industrious and active, in all their interprises, and worldly
concernments: and consequently do the seldomer miscarry. Whereas on the
contrary, those that -- (...) Nazianz. Orat. 3. (...). Id. Orat. 19.
out of the simplicity of their own hearts suspect no double-dealing by others,
are the more secure and credulous; by so much less solicitous to prevent
dangers and injuries, by how much less they fear them: and consequently are
often deceived by those they did not mistrust. Which very thing (the world
being apt withal to judge well or ill of men's counsels by their events) has
brought simplicity it self, though a most commendable virtue, under the
reproach of folly, (we call those simple fellows fools:) and has won to craft
and dissimulation the reputation of wisdom.

28. Lastly, the consciousness of an ill cause, unable to support it self by
the strength of its own goodness, drives the worldling to seek to hold it up
by his wit, industry, and such like other assistances: like a ruinous house,
ready to drop down, if it be not shored up with props, or stayed with
buttresses. You may observe it in Lawsuits: the worser cause ever the better
solicited. An honest man, that desires but to keep his own, trusts to the
equity of his cause, hops that will carry when it comes to hearing: and so
counsel, gives them information and instructions in the case, gets his
witnesses ready, and then thinks he needs trouble himself no farther. But a
crafty companion, that thinks to put another beside his right, will not rest
so content: but he will be dealing with the Jury, (perhaps get one packt for
his turn) tampering with the witnesses, tempting the Judge himself, (it may a
Letter, or a Bribe; he will leave no stone unmoved, no likely means (how
indirect soever) unattempted, to get the better of the day, and to cast his
adversary. You may observe it likewise in Church Affairs. A regular Minister
sits quietly at home, follows his study, does his duty in his own Cure,
and teaches his people truly and faithfully to do theirs; keeps himself
within his own station, and medleth no further: But schismatic spirits are
more pragmaticall: they will not be contained within their own circle, but must
be flying out; (...), they must have an Oar in every Boat; offering (yea
thrusting) themselves into every Pulpit, 1 Pet. 4 15.
before they be sent for; running from town to town, from house to house, that
they may scatter the seeds of sedition, and superstition, at every table, and
in every corner. And all this (so wise are they in their generation) to serve
their own belly, Romans 16.18.
and to make a prey of their poor seduced proselytes: for by this means the
people fall unto them, and thereout suck they no small advantage. You may
observe it also in most other things: but these instances may suffice.

29. The point thus proved and cleared, that the children of this world are
wiser then the children of light: that we may make First, let me say with St
Peter, (...). 1 Pet. 4.12.
Marvel not my brethren, when you see an evil cause prosper (it may be for a
long time together,) and the better side go down, as if some strange thing had
happened unto you, and such as never had been heard in the word before: neither
be troubled or scandalized at it. Fret not thy self (says David) at him whose
way does prosper, Psalm. 37.7.
against the man, that does after evil counsels. If you would but well consider
how solicitous, how industrious, how smooth and cunning, how unanimous they are
on the one side; how far short they on the other side are in all these and all
other like advantageous the saddest events that ever your eyes beheld, there is
no matter of wonderment at all. Yea, did not the powerful hand of Gods
overruling providence sometimes interpose, giving the enemy now and then a
sudden stop, when they are in their full cariere, in the height of their pride
and jollity; and making good his promises to his poor distressed Church, by
sending unexpected help and deliverance, when they are brought very low both in
their estates and hopes: we might rather wonder, that it is not even much worse
with the people of God then it is; and how they should be able at all to
subsist, their enemies having all the advantages

30. Let not their successes therefore trouble us. Rather (in the second place)
let their wisdom quicken us to a holy emulation. Not to imitate their ways,
nor to join with them in their wicked enterprises: to encourage them therein
by any unworthy compliances. It was not the stewards injustice, but his wisdom,
that his master commended him for, in the parable: and that our master in the
application of the parable intended to commend to us for our imitation. His
example should kindle a holy zeal in us, and an endeavor, to be as wise for
spir^^uals, and in the business of our souls; as he was, and as the children of
this world usually are, for temporals, and in the affairs of the world. It is
no shame at all for us, to learn wisdom of any whomsoever. 1. Of a poor
irrational contemptible Creature. [Vade ad formicam. Prove. 6.6.
Go to the pismire, O sluggard, and learn her ways; learn wisdom of her. 2.
Of an Enemy: Books have been written by Moralists, Plutarch. Ipsa nos excitet
hostium malicia pervigil. Bernard. sermon. 108.
de utilitate ab inimicis capienda. We curse our Enemies many times
unchristianly: whereas did we seriously consider, how much we are beholding to
them, for the greatest part of that wisdom and circumspection we show in the
managery of our affairs; we would not only bless them (as we are in Christian
charity bound) but heartily bless God for them also by way of gratitude for the
great benefit we reap by them. 3. Yea, of the Devil himself. Watch, says St
Peter; 1 Pet. 5.8.
for your adversary the Devil goes about etc. as if he should say, He watches
for your destruction; watch you therefore, the worldlings wisdom learn
something that may be of use to us; and that in each of the forementioned
particulars.

31. From their Sagacity; learn, to forecast how to please God; to fore-arme
our selves against all assaults and wiles of Satan; to fore-think, and to be in
some measure provided before hand of needful and proper expedients, for any
exigent or cross accident, that may probably befall us. 2. From their Industry;
learn, not to be slothful in doing service, nor to slack the time of our
repentance and turning to God; Romans 12.11.
to run with constancy and courage to the race that is set before us; to think
no pains, Heb. 12.1. Phil. 2.12.
no travail too much, that may bring us to heaven; to work out our salvation to
the uttermost with fear and trembling. 3. From their Hypocrisy and outward
seeming Holiness: learn, 1 Pet. 2.12.
to have our conversations honest toward them that are without, not giving the
least scandal in any thing that may bring reproach upon the Gospel; to shun the
very appearances of evil; and having first cleansed the inside well, 1 Thessalonians.
5.22.
to keep the outside handsome too: that by our piety, devotion, meekness,
patience, obedience, justice, charity, humility, and all holy graces, we may
not only stop up the mouth of the adversary from speaking evil glory to God,
and honor and reputation to our Christian profession thereby. 4. From their
Unity; learn, to follow the truth in love: to lay aside vain janglings, and
opposition of science falsely so called; Ephesians. 4.15. 1 Timothy 6.20.
to make up the breaches that are in the Church of Christ, by moderating and
reconciling differences, rather then to widen them by multiplying
controversies, and maintaining hot disputes; Romans 14.19.
follow the things that make for peace, and whereby we may edify one another.
Thus doing, we may gather grapes of thorns; make oil of Scorpions; extract all
the medicinal virtue out of the Serpent, and yet leave all the poisonous and
malignant quality behind.

32. Emulate them then we may: may we ought. It is the very main scope of the
parable, to provoke us to that. But sure envy them we must not; indeed we need
not: if we will but take the Limitation along with us, which now only remains
to be considered: and that (the time so requiring) very briefly. How much wiser
so ever these worldly-wise men seem to be, or indeed are (as quadantenus, and
in some few respects: Take them super totam materiam, and they are (...).
Arist. 6. Ethic. 13. Neminem malum esse, nisi stultum eundem, non modo a
sapientibus dicitur, sed vulgo quoque semper est creditum. Quint. 121.
stark fools for all that. Very Naturals, if they have no Grace. The
Limitation here in the Text, (...) terminus diminuens: and must be understood
accordingly. The Children of this world are said to be wiser then the Children
of light. But how wiser? Not in genere; simply, and absolutely, and in every
respect wiser: but (...) put for (...).
in genere suo: wiser in some respect, wiser in their kind of wisdom, such as
it is, (in worldly things, and for (...) taken properly.
worldly ends;) wisdom in comparison. For such kind of limiting and diminuent
terms, are for the most part destructive of that whereunto they are annexed;
and contain in them (as we use to say) oppositum in apposito. He that says, a
dead man, or a painted Lion, by saying more, says less, then if he had said
but a man, or a lion only, without those additions: it is all one upon the
point, as if he said no man, no lion. For a dead man is not a man, neither is a
painted lion a lion. So that our Savior here pronouncing of the Children of
this world that they are wiser, but thus limited, wiser in their generation;
implies that otherwise, and save in that respect wiser.

33. The truth is; simply and absolutely considered, the child of light, if he
be truly and really such, and not titular and by a naked profession only,
whatsoever he is taken for, is clearly the wiser man. And he that is no more
then worldly or carnally wise, is in very deed and in Gods estimation no better
then a very fool. [Where is the Wise? Where is the Scribe? Where is the
disputer of this World? has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? 1
Cor. 1.20.
says the Apostle. That interrogative form of speech is more emphatical, then
the bare Categoricall had been: it signifies as if it were so clear a truth,
that no Solomon says in one place of the covetous rich man, and in another
place of the sluggard, that he is wise in his own conceit; Prove. 28.11. --
26.16.
is true also of every vicious person in every other kind. Their wisdom is a
wisdom; but in conceit, not in truth: and that but in their own conceit
neither, and of some few judgments corrupted with the same lusts, wherewith
theirs also are. Chrysippus non dicet idem -- Solomon sure had not that
conceit of their wisdom, (and Solomon knew what belonged to wisdom, as well as
another man:) who puts the fool upon the sinner, I need not tell you,
(indeed I cannot tell you,) how often in his writings.

34. His judgment then is clear in the point: though it be a Paradox to the
most, and therefore would have a little farther affirm paradoxes, but we must
prove them too. First then, true saving wisdom is not to be learned but from
the word of God. ( A lege tua intellexi, By thy commandments have I gotten
understanding, Psalm. 119.104.
Psalm. 119.) it is that word, and that alone, that is able to make us wise unto
salvation. 2 Timothy 3.15.
How then can they be truly wise, who regard not that word, but cast it behind
their backs, and despise it? Jer. 8.9.
They have rejected the word of the Lord, and what wisdom is in them? says
Jeremy. Again, The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; and a good
understanding Psalm. 111. Psalm. 111.10.
How then can we allow them to pass for wise men, and good understanding men,
that have no fear of God before their eyes, -- 36.1.
that have no mind nor heart to do thereafter, that will not be learned nor
understand, -- 82.5.
but are resolvedly bent to walk on still in darkness, and wilfully shut their
eyes that they may not see the light?

35. Since every man is desirous to have some reputation of wisdom, and
accounts it the greatest scorn and reproach in the world to be called, or
made, a fool: it would be very well worth the labor (but that it would
require, as it well deserves, a great labor and time, then we dare now take)
to illustrate and enlarge this point: which, though it seem a very paradoxe (as
was now said) to the most, is yet a most certain and demonstrable truth; That
godliness is the best wisdom, and that there is no fool to the sinner. I shall
but barely give you some of the heads of proof; and referr the enlargement to
each man's private meditation. He that first is all for the present; and never
considers what mischiefs or inconveniences will follow thereupon afterward;
that secondly, when both are permitted to his choice, has not the wit to
prefer that which is eminently better, but chooses that which is extremely that
thirdly proposes to himself base and unworthy ends; that fourthly, for the
attaining even of those poor ends, makes choice of such means, as are neither
proper not probable thereunto; that fifthly, goes on in bold enterprises with
great confidence of success, upon very slender grounds of assurance; and that
lastly, where his own wit will not serve him, refuses to be advised by those
that are wiser then himself, what he wants in wit making it upon in will: a
fool. And every worldly or ungodly man is all this, and more: and every godly
man, the contrary. Let not the worldly-wise man therefore glory in his wisdom:
that it turn not to his greater shame, when his folly shall be discovered to
all the world. Let no man deceive himself, 1 Cor. 3.18.
says S. Paul: but if any man among you seem to be wise in this world, let him
become a fool, that he may be wise. That is; let him lay aside all vain conceit
of his own wisdom, and learn to account that seeming wisdom of the world, to be
(as indeed it is,) no better then folly: that so he may find that true wisdom
which is of God. The God of light and of wisdom so enlighten our with the
saving knowledge of his truth, and so inflame our hearts with a holy love and
fear of his Name, that we may be wise unto salvation: and so assist us with the
grace of his holy spirit, that the light of our good works and holy
conversation may so shine forth both before God and men in the mean time, that
in the end by his mercy who is the Father of lights, we may be made partakers
of the inheritance of the Saints in the light of everlasting life and glory:
and that for the merits sake of Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord. To whom,
etc.


Newport, in the Isle of Wight. December.
Heb. 12.3.


1. THere is scarce any other provocation to the performance of any duty so
prevalent with men, as are -- aculeos subdunt exempla nobilia. Senec. de
tranquil. cap. 1
the examples of such as have performed the same before them with glory and
success. emulation of their glory, and cheereth them on with hopes of like
success: it also clean takes off that, which is the common excuse of sloth and
neglect of duty, the pretension of Impossibility. The Apostle therefore, being
to confirm the minds of these Hebrews with constancy Christian course, against
all discouragements whatsoever; sets before them (in the whole former
Chapter) a multitude of examples of the famous worthies of former times: who by
the strength of their faith had both done and suffered great things with
admirable patience and constancy, to their immortal honor upon earth, and
eternal happiness in heaven. To the end, that compassed with such a cloud of
witnesses, they might think it a shame for them to hang back, and not to dare
(especially having withal so rich a crown, laid ready at the goal for them, to
invite them thereunto,) to run with all possible cheerfulness that race, which
they had seen so many so happily to have run before them, verse. 1. of this
Chapter.

2. Yet this great cloud of examples they were but to look through (as the
Medium) at another and higher example; that of the bright Sun of righteousness
himself, Jesus Christ: whom they are to look upon, as the proper object, to
terminate their thoughts; and whereon finally to fix their meditations. Looking
unto Jesus, etc. verse. 2. Which example, recommended to them first from the
compleatness of the person, (who is at both ends of the race, the Alpha and the
Omega; the (...), and the (...) too; the law at the start, and he that gives
the prize at the goal; the author and the finisher of our faith,) is there also
further amplified. First, from the things he suffered. Such, as then which none
more grievous to flesh and blood; Torture, and Ignominy: the Cross, and the
Shame. Secondly, from the manner of his suffering. Not patiently only,
enduring; but stoutly too, Despising them: He endured the cross and despised
the shame. Thirdly, from the issue and consequents of his sufferings, which
were in lieu of the pain, Joy; Of the shame, Glory. To intimate to these
Hebrews, that as it behoved Christ, Luke 24.26. 2 Timothy 2.13.
first to suffer, and then after to enter into his So, if they desire to come
to the same end he did, and to reign with him; they must resolve to take the
same way he did, and to suffer with him.

3. Having used so strong a motive, and pressed it so high; you would think the
Apostle needed not (as to this particular,) to say any more. But for all this
he cannot yet manum de tabula: he insisteth still, and in this verse urges the
due and frequent consideration of it, as a matter not only of great benefit,
but of some kind of necessity also. Considering the strong oppositions and
contradictions, that a Christian man after he has entered the lists is the
goal; all which he must encounter with and overcome, or else he loses his
labor and the prize: it is but needful he should muster up all his strength,
summon and recollect all the arguments he can think of, that may put courage
into him, and a resolution to go on undauntedly not-with-and Against which
fainting under the cross, there being no other cordial of so powerful and
present operation, toward the relieving of the drooping spirits of a weak
Christian; as is the meditation of Christ and his sufferings: (...), Therefore
consider him, says the Apostle, that endured such contradiction of sinners
against himself, that ye be not wearied and faint in your minds.

4. In which words, the Apostle, out of his great care of their souls health,
deals with these Hebrews, as a faithful and skilful Physician should do. He
shows them the danger they are in, and the means how to prevent it. The
danger, a spiritual (...), fainting and weariness of soul under the cross. The
means of prevention, frequent and effectual meditation of the cross of Christ.
The parts then of the Text are two: (answerable to those two main parts,
whereunto the whole method of Physic are after a sort reducible;) (...), and
(...), the one whereof treats of the disease, the other of the remedy. We
begin with the former, the disease: the former I mean, in the nature of the
things, (though not so in the placing of the words;) and so first to be
handled, in these words (...), etc. That ye be not wearied and faint in your
minds. The full importance whereof we shall The Malady; 2. The inward Cause
thereof; 3. The Part affected; and 4. The Subject, Person, or Patient.

5. For the Malady, (...): that is Weariness, as we translate it. There is no
burden, but a man would be willing to be eased of it, if he might: and all
afflictions are burdens. But such a degree of Weariness, as implies no more
then the bare desire of rest and ease, falls short of the notion of the word
(...). It imports such an extreme lassitude, as bereaveth a man of all his
strength, puts him beyond his patience, and takes him quite off work. When
he is so overcome with the pressure of the burden that lies sad upon him, that
he does succumbere oneri, is not able to bear it any longer, but would be rid
of it, if he could, at any rate: that is (...). Or when he is so enfeebled by
sickness, that he cannot in any wise brook to do the offices of his vocation as
formerly he has done, nor is able to stir out of his bed at all, nor well able
to stir himself in it: that is (...) too. The word is by S. James applied to
the state of a sick person, brought very low, James 5.15.
and in some extremity of sickness, under small hope of recovery. The prayer of
Faith, when other remedies fail, (...), shall says he there.

6. So that the danger here feared by the Apostle was, lest these Hebrews
meeting with such terrible difficulties, as Lions in the way, (not such Lions,
as Solomon's sluggard only fancieth to himself without cause, Prove. 26.13.
or perhaps but pretends to excuse his sloth thereby; Bug-bears indeed rather
then Lions; but very Lions indeed, Christian race, they should be quite beaten
out of the field, ere they came to the end of their course. Lest being
terrified by their adversaries, they should not be able to hold out in their
holy profession to the end; nor to maintain faith and a good conscience with
that courage, constancy, and perseverance they ought: but lose the goal and the
crown, for want of finishing the course, they had so happily begun.

7. But then Secondly it may be demanded; Of this malady Cause? (The inward
Cause I mean: for what is the outward Cause, is apparent enough; to wit, the
Cross.) or whence should this (...), this spiritual weariness proceed? That is
answered in the Text too, in the word (...). (The translations express it most
what by faintness of mind:) The same word being again used a little after at
ver. 5. and there also translated after the same manner; (...), My son, despise
not thou the chastening of the Lord: neither faint, when thou art corrected of
him. The word properly imports the loosening, slackening, or dissolving of
something that before was well knit together, fast and The strength and
firmness of a body, whether natural or artificial, consists much in the union
of the parts, well (...). Ephesians. 4.16.
compacted and knit together, and all the joints strung fast one to another. By
the slackning, loosening, or disjoynting whereof, the body on the other side,
comes to be as much weakened. A house, ship, wagon, plough, or other
artificial body, be the materials never so strong: yet if it be loose in the
joints, when it is put to any stress (as we call it) to any use where the
strength of it is like to be tried, it will not endure it, but be ready to fall
one piece from another.

8. Much of a man's strength, whereby he is enabled to travel loins and knees,
and in his arms and hands. Whence it is that by an usual trope in most
languages, and so in the Scriptures too, those parts are very often used (
Genua, and Lacerti etc.) to signify strength: and weakness on the contrary
usually described by the luxation of those parts. The phrase is very frequent
in Homer; when one of the Grecian or Trojan Chieftains had given his adversary
some deadly or desperate wound, that he was not able to stand but fell on the
ground; to express it thus, -- (...), as much as to say, So Ezekiel. 7.17. Nahum.
2.10.
He loosened his knees. Even as it it said of Belshazzar Dan. 5. when he was
sore affrighted with the handwriting upon the wall; that the joints (bindings
or ligatures) of his loins were So for the hands and arms; we meet in the
Scriptures often with such like phrases as these: that by such or such means
(as the occasion required,) such or such men's hands were either strengthened,
or weakened. So it is said of Isbosheth 2 Samuel 4. when he heard of the death of
Abner, general of his army, his hands were weakened. See Ezekiel. 21.7.
The like we find in many other places, as namely in Ier. 38.4. where, in the
Greek translation, the word (...) the same with this in the Text, is used. Not
to seek far, a little after in this very chapter, we have both the metaphors
together in one verse [ Wherefore lift up the hands that hang down, and
strengthen the feeble knees,] (...), verse. 12. which is another compound word
from the same Theme. As if he should say, Support the hands that hang loose,
and have not strength enough to lift up themselves: and bind up the palsy
knees, that are not well knit up in the joints, and so are unable to bear up
the body.

9. There is another Metaphor likewise, often used by David, and sometimes
elsewhere: which, as it very well fitteth with the word (...), so it serves
very well to express that feebleness or faintness of spirit, (arising from fear
and consternation of mind, the melting of the heart, or soul.

10. In Psalm. 107. They that go down to the sea in ships, when the stormy wind
arises and lifts up the waves, Psalm. 107.26.
so as the vessel is tossed up and down, and the men reel to and fro, and
stagger like drunkards, and are at their wits end: he says of them, that their
very soul melts away because of the trouble. Psalm. 119.28.
My soul melts away for very heaviness: in another Psalm, speaking of
himself, and his own troubles. In the 22. Psalm, he joyneth this and the other
Metaphor both together; I am powered out like water, Psalm. 22.14.
and all my And so does the Prophet Esaias also: describing the great miseries
and terrors that should be at the destruction of Babylon by the Medes and
Persians, he says, Esaias 13.6. So also Nahum 2.10.
that by reason thereof all hands shall be weakened, ((...) again in the Greek,)
and all hearts shall melt.

11. For even as wax, which while it is hard will abide hard pressing, and not
yield or take impression,) when it is chafed or melted has no strength at all
to make resistance: And as the Ice, when the waters are congealed in a hard
frost, is of that firmness, that it will bear a laden cart uncrakt; but as
soon as a warm water, and becomes one of the weakest things in the world, (it
is a common proverb among us, As weak as water:) so is the spirit of a man. So
long as it stands firmly knit to God by a steadfast faith, (as David says, O
knit my heart unto thee, that I may fear thy name! Psalm. 86.11.
) and true to it self, Horat. 2. Sat. 7.
( in seipso totus teres atque rotundus,) by adhering to honest, principles: it
is of impregnable strength against all outward attempts whatsoever. Horat. 3.
Car. 3.
Si fractus illabatur orbis: if the weight of all the calamities in the world
should come rushing upon him at once, it would be able to bear up under them
all, and stand unruined amidst all those ruins. Prove. 18.14.
The spirit of a man is of strength enough to sustain all his infirmities.

12. But if the strength that is in us be weakness; oh how great is that
weakness? If our spirits within us, which should be as our lifeguard to secure
us against all attempts from without, be shattered and dis-joynted, through
distrust in God; or by entertaining so enfeebled, that it is not able to stand
out when it is fiercely assaulted, but yields the fort to Satan and his
temptations: that is to say in plain terms, if when any persecution or
tribulation arises, we be scandalized and fall away either from our Christian
faith or duty, forsake our standing, and shrink from the rules of true Religion
or a good conscience: this is the (...) and the (...), the weariness and
faintness of mind spoken of in the Text.

13. We now see the Malady, both in the Nature, and in the Cause: both what it
is, and whence it grows. We are in the next place to consider the Part
affected. That the word (...) discovers: the Mind, or the Soul; (That ye be
not wearied and faint in your minds; or souls.) And this occasioneth another
doubt: how it should be possible that worldly tribulations, which cannot reach
beyond the outer-man, (in his possessions, in his liberty, in his good name, in
his bodily health or life,) should have such an operation upon his nobler part
the soul, as to cause a faintness there. Our Apostle speaks of resisting unto
blood in the next verse, as the highest suffering that can befall a man in this
world. And our Savior tells his friends Luke 12. that when their enemies
have killed their bodies, Luke 12.4.
(and from suffering so much his very best friends, it their souls.

14. It is most true: they have not. And happy it is for us, and one singular
comfort to us, that they have not. Yet our own reason, and every days
experience can teach us, that outward bodily afflictions, and tribulations, do
(by consequent, and by way of sympathy and consent, and by reason of union;
though not immediately and directly,) work even upon the soul also. As we see
the fancy quick and roaving, when the blood is enflamed with choler; and
apprehension dull in a Lethargy: and other notable changes and effects in the
faculties of the soul very easily discernable, upon any sudden change or
distemper in the body. David often confesses, that the troubles he met withal,
went sometimes the very heart and soul of him. [ The sorrows of my heart are
enlarged. Psalm. 25. -- 94. -- 55. -- 42.
In the multitude of the troubles (or sorrows) that I have in my heart. My
heart is disquieted within me. Why art thou so vexed O my soul, and why art
thou so disquieted within me? etc.] Take but that one, in Psalm. 143. The enemy
has persecuted my soul -- etc. Therefore is my spirit vexed within me, 143.2,
3.
and my heart within me is desolate.

15. For the Soul then (or Mind) to be affected with such things as happen to
the body, is natural: and such affections, (if not vitiated with excess, or
other inordinacy) blameless and without sin. But experience shows us farther
(too often, God knows,) that afflictions, and such other sad casualties as
befall the body, (nay, the very shadows thereof, the bare fears of such things
and apprehensions of their approach, yea even many times when it is causeless,)
may produce worse effects in the soul; and be the causes of such vicious
weariness and faintness of mind, as the Apostle here forewarneth the Hebrews
to beware of. Not to speak of the Lapsi, and Traditores, and others that we
read of in former times; and of whom there is such frequent mention in the
ancient Councels, and in the writings of the Fathers of the first ages, and the
Histories of the Church: How many have we seen even in our times; Truth, and in
the performance of the offices of Virtue, and duties of Piety, Allegiance, and
Justice before trial; have yet when they have been hard put to it, (ey, and
sometimes not very hard neither,) falling away, starting aside like a broken
bow: and by flinching at the last, Psalm. 78.57.
discovered themselves to have been but very weak Christians at the best, if
not rather very deep hypocrites.

16. It will sufficiently answer the doubt, to tell you, That persecutions and
all occurrences from without, are not the chief causes, (nor indeed in true
propriety of speech, any causes at all,) but the only, of the souls fainting
under them. Temptations they are I grant; yet are they but temptations: and it
is not the temptation, but the consenting to the temptation, that induces
guilt. If at any time any temptation, either on the one hand, or the other,
prevail against us: S. James teaches us where to lay the fault. Not upon God
by any means: for God tempts no man. James 1.13, 14.
No nor upon the Devil neither, (let me add that too; it were a sin to belly
the Devil in this) for though he be a tempter, and that a busy one, (...) the
Tempter, yet that is the worst he can do; he can but tempt us, he cannot compel
us. Mat. 4.3.
When he has plied us with all his the will has its natural liberty still,
and it is at our choice whether we will yield or no. But every man when he is
tempted, says he, (tempted cum effectu, that is his meaning; so tempted as to
be overcome by the temptation,) is tempted of his own lust, (...), drawn away
and entised. Drawn by injuries and affrightments from doing good: or entised
by delights and allurements to do evil. It is with temptations on the left
hand, (for such are those of which we now speak) even as it is with those on
the right: yield not, and good enough. My son, says Solomen, if sinners entise
thee, consent not, Prove. 1. It may be said also proportionably, Prove. 1.10.
and by the same reason; My son, if sinners affright thee, comply not. The
common saying, if in any other, holds most true in the case of Temptations:
No man takes harm but from himself.

17. And verily in the particular we are now upon, of fainting it is nothing
but our own fears, and the falseness of a mis-giving heart, that betraieth us
to the Tempter, and undoeth us. Epictet. enchir. cap. 5.
(...) -- etc. as he said. It is not any reality in the things themselves so
much that troubles the mind, as our Opinio est, quae nos Cruciet. Senec. ad
Marciam. cap. 19. Prove. 21.25. Joh 14.27.
over-deep apprehensions of them. All passions of the mind, if immoderate, are
perturbations, and may bring a snare: but none more or sooner then fear. The
fear of man brings a snare, says Solomon. And our Savior, Let not your
hearts be troubled, neither fear: as if fear were the greatest troubler of the
heart. And truly so it is: No passion, (not Love, no nor yet Anger it self,
though great obstructers of Reason both,) being so irrational, as Fear is. It
makes us many times do things quite otherwise then our own reason tells us
we should do. It is an excellent description, that a wise man has given of it
Wisdom 17. Fear, Wisd. 17.11.
says he, is nothing else, but the betraying of the succors which reason
offers. He that lets go his courage, forfeiteth his reason withal: and
what good can you reasonably expect from an unreasonable man?

18. See thou then a man faint-hearted? Suspect him, (I had almost said,
Conclude him,) false-hearted too. It is certainly a very hard thing, if at all
possible, for a Coward to be an honest true friend either to God or man. He is
at the best but (...), Jam. 1.8.
a double-minded man: but God requires simplicity and singleness of heart. He
has a good mind perhaps to be honest, and to serve God and the king, and to
love his neighbor and his friend: and if he would hold him there, and be of
that mind always, all would be well. But his double-minde will not suffer him
so to do. He has a mind withal to sleep in a whole skin, and to save his
estate, if he can, howsoever. And so he becomes (...), fickle and unstable in
his ways; turns as Exodus 18.21.
Iethro well considered this, when he advised Moses to make choice of such for
Magistrates, as he knew to be men of courage; they that were otherwise, he knew
could not discharge their duty as they ought, nor continue upright. And when
our Savior I say unto you my friends, Luke 12.4.
Fear not them which kill the body: he does more then intimate that such base
worldly fear cannot well consist with the Laws of true friendship.

19. I insist somewhat the more upon this point, because men are generally so
apt to pretend, to their own failings in this kind, the outward force offered
by others: supposing they have said enough, to excuse what they have done; when
they have said, they did it by compulsion. As if any man could be master of
another will, or enforce a consent from him without his consent: which
carries before it a manifest contradiction. Indeed if we suffer what Malum
quod fit in nos, sive de nobis, non est imputandum nobis: caeterum quod fit and
a nobis, jam non sine culpa est voluntatis. Bern. de great. and lib. arb.
not in our power to help it. But if we do what we should not, upon what
inducement so ever we do it, we must bear the greatest part of the blame our
selves: because it is our doing still.

20. For a man then, when he has been frighted out of his conscience and his
duty, and done amiss, to say, I was compelled to do it against my mind, I
could neither will nor choose, and the like: are, as the most common, so the
most vain and frivolous excuses in false, but ridiculously false, and such as
carry their confutation along with them: fig leaves so thin, that any body may
see through them. For tell me, thou that say thou wast compelled to do it
Vel^e plane convincimur, quod non fieret si nollemus. Bern. Ibid.
against thy mind: if thou had been minded to have withstood the pretended
compulsion, and had continued in that mind; whether such compulsion could
have taken effect or no? Thou that say, thou could neither will nor
choose: was it not left to the choice of thine own will, whether thou would
do that which was required, or suffer that which was threatened? and did not
thou then, when thou might have chosen, if thou would, suffer the one;
rather choose to do the other? Qui mavult, vult. Sure it is the will evermore,
that determines the choice in every deliberation. It is manifestly absurd
therefore, for any man to pretend that thing to have been done by him against
his will; which (how hard soever the choice was,) he yet chose to do.

21. If these allegations would serve the turn, or that we had any good warrant
to decline suffering evil by doing evil: those glorious Martyrs and
Confessors, so much renowned through the Christian world for their patience
and constancy in suffering persecution, says and a good conscience; were a
generation of very silly men. Who never had the wit to save their lives, when
they might have done it with some little compliances with the times; and if
their consciences had smitten them for so doing, licked themselves whole again
by pleading Compulsion.

22. Unless then we will condemn those blessed souls, whose folly; but of foul
self-murder too, in being prodigal of their lives to no purpose, and casting
away themselves wilfully when they needed not: we must needs acknowledge, That
there lies a necessity upon us, Matthew. 16.24.
if we will be Christ's disciples and friends, to deny our selves, our lusts,
our interests, our fortunes, our liberties, our lives, or if there be any thing
else that can be dearer to us: rather then for fear of any thing that can befall
in any of these, consent to the least wilful violation of our bounden duty
either to God or our Neighbor; That no force or violence from without, no
straits we can be necessary for us to sin, or excusable in us to have sinned;
That we are bound by virtue of Christ's both example and command, to take up any
cross that it is his good pleasure to lay before us, and to bear it as long as
he pleases, with patience, cheerfulness, and courage; That if we grow weary of
it, and faint in our minds, so as to cast about how we may work our selves
from under it by such means, as we have no clear warrant from him for: we must
answer wholly for it our selves, and cannot justly charge it upon any other
person or thing, then upon our own selves, and our own base

23. To return now to these Hebrews: the Persons in the Text; and the last of
the four particulars proposed from that part of the Text. It may be demanded,
with what reason the Apostle could entertain the least suspicion of such men's
shrinking and fainting under the Cross: who had already given such good proof
of their constancy and courage, in some former, and those no small conflicts
neither? Nay, of whose Christian patience and magnanimity himself had given a
very ample testimony a little before in this very Epistle: Heb. 10.32. -- 4.
how they had endured a great fight of afflictions, and had a gazing-stock both
by reproaches and afflictions, suffered the spoiling of their goods; and not
only suffered it, (patience perforce,) but suffered it joyfully. Yet you see
for all this, how urgent he is upon them still, in the remainder of that tenth
Chapter, in the whole next, and in a great part of this, both before, in, and
after the Text; by admonitions, exhortations, examples, and other topiques,
artifices, and insinuations of great variety: not to cast away their
confidence; to hold fast their profession without wavering; to run with
patience the race that was set before them; to take heed they be not wearied,
and faint in their minds.

24. Not to say positively, that he had of late observed some particular cause
of suspicion more then ordinary: although there be some passages in his
discourse (especially at the fifth verse) that seem to carry a sound, as if
something were not right with them. If we general considerations only: we shall
see reasons enough, why the Apostle (notwithstanding his approving of their
former carriage,) might yet be jealous over them with a godly jealousy in this
matter.

25. First, he knew not ( persecutions ever attending the Church as her lot)
but they might; and (Christ having foretold great tribulations shortly to come
upon that nation) it was very like they should meet with more and stronger
trials, then they had ever yet done. It was indeed, and by the Apostles
confession, a great trial of afflictions they had undergone already; and they
had received the charge bravely, and were come off with honor and victory:
trials were yet behind? These might be, for ought they knew, (or he either,)
but the beginnings of greater evils to ensue. You have not resisted unto blood,
says he, in the very next words after the Text: as if he had said, You have
fought one good fight already, and quit your selves like men: I commend you for
it, and I bless God for it. Yet be not high-minded, but fear: you have not yet
done all your work; your warfare is not yet at an end. What if God should call
you to suffer the shedding of your blood for Christ, as Christ shed his blood
for you? you have not been put to that yet: strive against sin, and to
withstand all sinful temptations, even to the shedding of the last drop of
blood in your bodies, if God call you to it: you have done nothing. He that
hates not his life, as well as his house and lands, for Christ and his
kingdom, Luke 14.26.
is not worthy of either. Sharp or long assaults may tire out him, that has
endured shorter and easier. But he that sets forth for the goal, if he will
obtain, must resolve to devour all difficulties, and to run it out: and not to
faint or slug, till he have finished his course to Lions in the way.

26. Secondly, so great is the natural frailty of man, so utterly averse from
conforming it self entirely to the good will and pleasure of Almighty God,
either in doing or suffering: that, if he be not the better principled within,
(strengthened with grace in the inner man,) he will not be able to hold out in
either; but every sorry temptation from without will foil him, and beat him
off. Be not weary of well-doing, Gal 6.9.
says the Apostle Gal. 6. for in due time we shall reap if we faint not,
(...), (the same word again*) Weariness faintness of mind we are subject to
(you see) in the point of well doing: But how much more then, in the point of
suffering; which is of the two much the sorer trial?

27. Marvel not, if ordinary Christians, such as these Hebrews were, might be
in danger of fainting under the Cross: when the most holy and eminent of Gods
servants, whose faith and patience piety are recorded in the Scriptures as
exemplary to all posterity, have by their failings in this kind bewrayed
themselves to be but men, (...), subject to passions of fear and distrust, even
as others. Abraham the father of the faithful, of so strong faith and
obedience, that he neither staggered at the promise of having a son (though it
were a very unlikely one, at that age) through unbelief; nor stumbled at the
command of sacrificing that son, (though it were a very hard one, having no
more,) through disobedience: yet coming among strangers, upon some
apprehensions that his life might be endangered if he should own Sarah to be
his wife: his heart so humane frailty, that he showed some distrustfulness of
God, by his doubting and dissimulation with Pharaoh first, and after with
Abimelech. Genesis 13. and 20.

28. And David also, so full of courage sometimes, that he would not fear,
though ten thousands of people, whole armies of men, should rise up against him
and encompass him round about; psalm. 3.6. -- 27.3.
though the opposers were so strong and numerous, that the earth should be
moved and the mountains shake at the noise thereof: -- 46.2, 3.
yet at some other times, when he saw no end of his troubles, but that he was
hunted like a partridge upon the mountains day after day, 1 Samuel 26.20.
and chased melt and to faint within him. And although he had a promise from
God of succeeding in the kingdom, and an anointing also (as an earnest) to
confirm the promise: yet it ran strongly in his thoughts nevertheless, that he
should perish one day by the hands of Saul. Insomuch that in a kind of
distrust of Gods truth and protection, 1 Samuel 27.1.
he ventured so far upon his own head, (never so much as asking counsel at the
mouth of God,) as to expose himself to great inconveniences, hazards, and
temptations, in the midst of an hostile and idolatrous people. Psalm. 77.6. --
12.
The good man was sensible of the imperfection, acknowledges it an infirmity
and striveth Psalm. 77.

29. But of all the rest, S. Peter ((...), as Chrysostom often styles him) a
man of great boldness and fervency of spirit, betrayed the greatest weakness.
Who, after so fair warning so lately given him, and his own so confident
profession of laying down his life in his masters quarrel: yet within not many
hours after, when he began to be questioned about his Master, and saw (by the
malicious and partial proceedings against the Master) how it was like to go
with him, if he were known to have such a near dependence faint-hearted, that
(contrary to his former resolutions and engagement) he not only dis-owned him,
but with oaths and imprecations forswore him. Mark. 14.71.
Such weakness is there in the flesh, where there is yet left some willingness
in the spirit: that without a continual supply of grace, and actual influence
of strength from above, there is no absolute stedfastness to be found in the
best of the sons of men.

30. Yet is not our natural inability to resist temptations (though very
great,) the cause of our actual faintings so much, (because of the ready
assistance of Gods grace to relieve us, if we would but be as ready to make use
of it:) as a third thing is. To wit our supine negligence, that we do not stand
upon our guard as it concerns us to do, nor provide for the encounter in
time: but have our -- In pace, ut sapiens, pararet idonea bello. Hor. 2. saty.
2.
arms to seek, when the enemy is upon us. As Joseph in the years of plenty
laid in provision against the years of dearth: so calm, provide for a storm;
and whilst we are at ease, against the evil day. It is such an ordinary point
of wisdom in the common affairs of life, for men to be provided of all
necessaries befitting their several occasions, before the time they should use
them: that he is rather derided then pitied, that having time and means for
it, neglects so to do. The grasshopper in the fable had the merrier summer:
but the pismire fared better in winter. If in our prosperity we grow secure,
flattering our selves in our own thoughts, Psalm. 30.6. etc.
as if our hill were so strong that we should never be removed: if then God do
but turn his face from us, yea, but a troubled at the affliction when it
comes, by how much the less we expected it before. Our unpreparednesse makes
a very little affliction sometimes fall very heavy upon us; and then it foyleth
us miserably, and soon tireth us out: and so we suffer by our own negligence.

31. To which add in the fourth place, that which many times follows upon
such our neglect; Gods deserting of us; and withdrawing the ordinary support of
his grace from us. And then as the Philistines over-mastered Sampson, when his
strength was departed temptations us, when we are left to wrestle with them by
our own strength alone, without the special grace of God to assist. It is by
Faith that we stand, if we do stand; ( This is the victory that overcomes the
world, even our Faith: 2 Cor. 1.24. 1 John 5.4.
) But it is by the grace and power of God, that our Faith it self stands.
Take that grace away, and our Faith fails* and then our hearts fail: and then
there is neither courage, nor patience, nor obedience, nor any thing else that
good is, in us. At least, not in that measure, as to render our ways (during
that estate,) either acceptable to God, or comfortable to our selves: until it
shall please him to renew us unto repentance, Psalm. 51.10. -- 12.
to give us the comfort of his and to stablish us afresh with his free spirit
and grace.

32. Of whose most holy and wise dispensations, although we be neither able nor
worthy to apprehend any other reason, then his own will, nor to comprehend
that: Joh. 3.8.
(for his spirit breaths where and when it lists, and we know not
(antecedently) either why, Psalm. 145.17.
or how: yet are we well assured in the general, that the Lord is righteous in
all his ways, and holy in all his works. Yea, and we find by the blessed
consequents many times, that the very withdrawing of his grace is it self a
special act of his grace. 1. As, when he has thereby humbled us to a better
sight and sense of our own frailty: 2 Chro. 32.31
so was Hezekiah left to himself in the matter of the Ambassadors that came
from the King of Babel. 2. Or checked us for our overmuch self-confidence: as
Peter's denial was a real rebuke for his over-bold protestation. 3. Or brought
us to acknowledge with thankfulness and humility, by whose (...). Homer. II.
(...). Psalm. 59.9. Gal. 6.1.
strength it is that we have My strength will I ascribe unto thee, Psalm 59.)
4. Or taught us to bear more compassion toward our brethren and their
infirmities, if they hap to be overtaken with a fault, and to restore them with
the spirit of meekness: considering, that even we our selves are not such, as
cannot be tempted. Or wrought some other good effect upon us some other way.

33. Since then great and lasting afflictions are strong trials of men's patience
and courage; and their inability to bear them, great through the frailty of
nature is yet by their own personal default and supine negligence much greater;
and without the support Gods grace, (which as he is no ways bound to give
them, so he may, and does when it pleases him, take from them,) their spirits
are not able to bear up under the least temptation: you will grant the Apostle
had great reason to fear, lest these Hebrews notwithstanding the good proof
they had given of their Christian constancy in some former trials, should yet
be weary and faint in their minds under greater sufferings. And consequently
how it concerns every one of us, whatsoever comforts we may have of our
former sufferings and patience (whereof, unless God have the whole glory, our
comfort sure will be the less;) yet to be very jealous of our own treacherous
hearts, and to keep a constant watch over them too high-minded or jolly for any
thing that is past; nor too unmerciful censurers of our weaker brethren for
their faintings and failings; nor too confident of our own future standing.

34. It ought to be our care rather at all times, especially in such times as
threaten persecution to all those, that will not recede from such principles of
Religion, Justice, and Loialty, as they have hitherto held themselves obliged
to walk by: to live in a continual expectancy of greater trials and temptations
daily to assault us, then we have yet wrestled withal. And to give all
diligence, by our prayers and utmost endeavors, to arm and prepare our selves
for the better bearing them, with such calm patience and moderation on the one
side, and yet with such undaunted courage and resolution on the other side; as
may evidence at once our humble to whatsoever it shall please God to lay upon
us, and our high contempt of the utmost despite the world can do us.

35. For since every affliction ( Ianus-like) has two faces, and looks two
ways; we should do well to make our use of both. It looks backward, as it
comes from God: who lays it upon us, as a correction for some past sin. And
it looks forward as it comes from Satan and the World: who lay it before us,
as a temptation to some new sin. Accordingly are we to entertain it. As it is
Gods correction; by no means to despise it, ( My son despise not thou the
chastening of the Lord, the next verse but one:) but to take it up bear it with
patience, and to profit by it to repentance. But as it is Satan's temptation; by
all means to resist it, with courage, ey and with disdain too. Resist it I say;
but in that sense wherein such resistance is to be understood in the very next
verse after the Text. That is to say, so to resist the temptation, by striving
against that sin what ever it be, which the Tempter seeks to drive us into by
the affliction; that we should fight it out in blood: resolving rather to lose
it all, were it to the last drop, then consent to the committing of that. Thus
to lose our blood, is to win the day: And the failing so to do, is that
weariness and faintness of mind and soul: of which our Apostle here speaks,
and upon

36. Yet dare I not for all that leave it thus, without adding a necessary
caution: lest what has been said be mis-understood, as if, when we are bidden
not to faint under the Cross, we were forbidden to use any means or endeavors
to remove it. No such matter. True it is, where no more is left to our choice,
but one of the two, either Sin or Suffer; a right Christian should not (for
shame) so much as take it into deliberation. Never demur upon it; it is a plain
case: we must suffer. But where is a Medium, or third thing (as an outlet, or
(...). Pythag. aur. carm.
expedient) between both, as many times choice of that; and so neither sin, nor
suffer. Lay that first as a sure ground, We must avoid sin, though we suffer
for it: But that once laid, if we can then avoid suffering too, without
sinning; why may we not, nay, why ought we not, to avoid both?

37. No man doubts, but we may pray to be delivered from troubles; David does
it a hundred times: and if we do it not daily too, even as often as as we beg
our daily bread, (our Savior having contrived both petitions into the same
prayer, we are too And if we may pray for it; then no doubt, but we may
endeavor it also. Though they look something alike in some other respects; yet
in this one (at least) Wishes and Prayers are much unlike. Many things we may
lawfully wish for, which we may not endeavor after! but sure, whatsoever we
may lawfully pray for, we not only lawfully may; but are in conscience bound to
use our endeavors toward the effecting thereof. We do indeed but mock God,
and prevaricate in our Prayers; if we be not in some measure careful to second
them with our Endeavors.

38. Christ bids us deny our selves, and take up the Cross. True: deny our
selves rather then deny him; and take up the Cross, when he lays it before us
so, -- (...). Nazianz orat. 20.
as we cannot step beside it without sin. But he does not bid us undo our
selves, when his service requires it not; nor make our selves Crosses, when we
need not.

39. Afflictions are useful things, and many ways beneficial good sometimes
comes from them, it is but merely by accident, as to them: the true cause of
those blessed effects is that overruling power, wisdom, and goodness of God;
whereby he is able to bring light out of darkness, and can turn any evil, (even
sin it self) to the good of his Children. But take afflictions precisely as
they are in themselves, and in their pure naturals as we say; and there is no
such loveliness in them, that any man should court them: Nor are they
productive of any the least good, by any proper inherent virtue of their own.
Nor desirable things, as that any man can reasonably promise to himself any
good effect from them, or any sound comfort under them, that shall wilfully
draw them upon himself, when he might without sin avoid them.

40. We must not count life, liberty, or livelihood dear to us: but despise
them all, yet even hate them, for Christ's sake and the Gospels. True: where any
of those stand in opposition against, or but in competition with Christ, or his
Gospel, or any duty therein contained. In case of competition, despise them: in
case of opposition hate them. Do so, and spare not. But otherwise, and out of
those Cases, these are the good blessings of God, wherewith vile in our eyes,
as that we should think we may trifle them away as we list, no necessity so
requiring.

41. It is the most proper act of Fortitude to endure hardship. True: To endure
it; but not to provoke it. We shall be like to find in the world hardship
enough, whereon to exercise our manhood; without seeking. It is a foolhardy
madness, (better beseeming such a Knight Errant as is described in the
Romances, then a Soldier of Christ, such as the Gospel sets forth,) to
roame abroad to seek adventures. Afflictions are Temptations, as was said: and
it is a presumption both rash and absurd, having prayed to God not to lead us
into temptations, to go and cast our selves into them, when we have done.
Fortitude is an excellent virtue doubtless: Prudence too, as well as it; and
Justice, no less then either. And therefore the offices of different Virtues
are so to be exercised, as not to hinder or destroy one another (for between
Omnibus inter se virtutibus am^citia. Senec. Epist. 110.

-- virtutum est inhonesta contentio. Bern. in Aununc. ser. 1. 2 Timothy 3.2.


virtuous acts there must be, there can be, no clashing:) a man may without
disparagement to his Fortitude, decline dangers, according to the dictates of
Prudence: provided withal, that nothing be done, but what is according to the
Rules of Justice.

42. St Paul says of some that he had to deal with, that they were
unreasonable men. Possibly it may be our case, to have to do with such men:
Reason will not satisfy them; and it is not reason. True: but this very thing
is agreeable to reason, that to live at quiet among unreasonable men, we should
sometimes yield to their unreasonable demands. But usque ad aras still: that
must evermore be understood. In the pursuance of peace with our neighbors,
where it is not to be had upon better terms, we may and ought by all seasonable
compliances and condescensions to become omnia omnibus, all things to all men:
even as Christ to make peace for us, condescended to be made like unto us And
as his condescension for us had yet one, and but one exception (made like unto
us in all things, yet without sin:) so should our condescension to them be
likewise, Heb. 4.15.
sin (and sin only) excepted, though upon conditions otherways hard and
unequal enough.

43. The sum is. For the obtaining of peace, the preventing of mischiefs, the
ridding of our selves and others from troubles; we may with a good conscience
and without sin yield to the doing of any thing, that may stand with a good
Conscience, and be done without sin. Nor it is to be interpreted, either as an
effect of faint-heartedness, Christian patience and courage, so to do: but is
rather to be esteemed an act of Christian Wisdom and duty. But so to faint
under the Cross, as to deny the Faith, to forsake our Religion, to violate the
dictates of natural Conscience, to do any thing contrary to any of the rules of
Justice or Charity; or which we either know or suspect to be a sin; though it
be for the shunning of any danger, or under the pretension of any necessity
whatsoever: cannot consist with that nobleness of spirit and magnanimity, which
becomes a worthy disciple of Christ.

44. I should have proceeded, according to my first intendment Remedy of, or
rather Preservative against, this faint-heartedness we have been all this while
in hand with; to wit the Meditation of Christ and his sufferings. But all I
shall have time now to do will be to give you the heads of those most useful
and observable points,

45. First the Act in the verb here used, discovers an excellent piece of
Art, a rare secret in this mystery, a short and compendious, but withal a very
effectual way, how to lighten such afflictions as lie sad upon us, to our
apprehensions, thereby to make them the more portable: for afflictions are
lighter or heavier according to our apprehensions of them. Ovid.
Leve fit, quod been fertur, onus. The original word is of more pregnant
signification to this purpose, then translatours can render it: (...). It
imports, not the bare consideration of a thing by it self alone; but the
considering of it by weighing and comparing it with some other things of like
kind or nature, and observing the analogies and proportions between it and
them. Certainly it would be of mavelous use to us, for the rectifying our
judgments concerning those pressures which at any time are upon us, to render
them less ponderous in our estimation of them: if we would duly compare them,
first with the intolerable weight of our sins, whereby we have deserved them;
or secondly with the weight of those everlasting grievous pains in Hell, which
by the sharpness of our short sufferings here, (if we make the right use of
them, to be thereby humbled unto repentance) by the mercy of God we shall
escape; or thirdly with that so exceeding and eternal weight of glory and joy
in the kingdom of heaven, which by the free goodness of our God we expect in
compensation of our light and momentany afflictions here; or fourthly, with the
weight of those far greater and heavier trials, which other our brethren and
fellow servants, either

46. (...). None of all these singly, but are of singular virtue toward the
desired effect: but all of them together, if artly applied, can hardly fail the
cure. Especially if you add thereunto that one ingredient more, which is alone
here expressed, (indeed the most sovereign of all the rest) as the object of
this analogy or consideration in the Text: to wit, the incomparable bitter
sufferings of our ever blessed Lord and Master JESUS CHRIST.

47. Then farther, in this Object, as it is amplified in this short First, Who
it was that suffered. Consider him: his Greatness, his Innocence, his Goodness.
Secondly, how he suffered. (...), he endured it also; not suffered it only.
Consider him endured it so willingly, so patiently, so cheerfully. Thirdly,
from whom he suffered it. (...), From sinners. Sinners, in their nature; sinful
men: Sinners, in the Jews esteem; Heathen men: Sinners, in the inward
constitution of their own hearts; Hypocrites and Malignants: Sinners, in their
outward carriage toward him, and their undue and illegal proceedings against
him; no just cause, no just proofs, but clamours and outcries, railing, and
spitting, and buffeting, and insulting, and all manner of contumelious and
despiteful usage. Fourthly, what he suffered. (...), such opposition and
contradiction of sinners against himself. Contradictions manifold: of all
sorts, and in all person: denied to be the Son of God. To his Office: not
received as the promised Messiah. To his Doctrine: given out as a deceiver. To
his Miracles: disgraced, as he had been a Conjurer, and dealt with the Devil.
To his Conversation: defamed as a glutton and a wine-bibber, a profane fellow
and a sabbath-breaker, a companion of Publicans and Sinners. To his very life
and being: Not him, but Barabbas; Away with him, Crucify him, Crucify him.

48. These are the heads. Many they are, you see; and of worthier
consideration, then to be crowded into the later end of a consider (actually
and thoroughly consider,) him that endured such contradiction of sinners against
himself: and having so done, applyingly consider, whether it can be reasonable,
or almost possible, for any of us to faint under our petty sufferings. What are
we; the best of us, the greatest of us, to him? Or what our sufferings; the
worst of them, the greatest of them to his? I have done.


Lincoln in the year 1630. at the request of Sr. DANIEL DELIGNE Knight, then
High-Sheriffe of that County.
I. Ser. on Prove. 24.10 -- 12. 10. If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy
strength is small.

11. If thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death, and

12. If thou say, Behold, we knew it not? does not he that pondereth the
heart consider it? and he that keeps thy soul, does not he know it? and
shall not he render to every man according to his works?


1. AS in most other things, so in the performance of that duty which this Text
aims at; we are neither careful before hand (such is the uncharitableness of
our incompassionate hearts) to the pride of our spirits) to acknowledge we have
done ill. The holy Spirit of God therefore has directed Solomon, in this
Scripture, wherein he would incite us to the performance of the Duty, to frame
his words in such sort, as to meet with us in both these corruptions: and to
let us see, that the duty is necessary, and may not be neglected; so the
neglect is damnable, and cannot be excused. In the handling whereof, I shall
not need to bestow much labor, either in searching into the contexture of the
words, or examining the differences of translatitions. Because the sentence (as
in the rest of this book for the most part) has a complete sense within it
self, without any necessary either dependence upon any thing going before, or
reference to any thing coming after: and the differences that are in the
translations, are neither many in number, nor of any great weight, for altering
the meaning of the words. Nor is it my purpose to insist upon inferior
observations, as might be raised from some expressions or circumstances in the
Text, otherwise then as they shall occasionally fall in our way, in the
prosecution of those main points, which to the apprehension of every
understanding hearer do at the very first view appear to have been chiefly
intended therein.

2. And they but two. First, the supposal of a duty; though for the most part,
and by most men, very slackly regarded; and that is the delivering of the
oppressed: In the two former verses, [If thou faint in the day of adversity; If
thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death, and those that are
ready to be slain.] Secondly, the removal of the common pretensions, which men
usually plead by excuse, or extenuation at least, when they have failed in the
former duty: in the last verse [ If thou say, Behold, we knew it not: does
not he that pondreth the heart consider it, etc.] So that if we will speak any
thing to the purpose of the Text, we must of necessity speak to those two
points, that do therefrom so readily offer themselves to our consideration: to
wit, the necessity of the duty first, and then the vanity of the excuses.

3. The Duty is contained, and the necessity of it gathered, in and from the
tenth and eleventh verses, in these words; If thou faint in the day of
adversity, thy strength is small: If thou forbear to deliver Wherein the
particulars considerable are; First, the Persons to whom the duty is to be
performed, as the proper object of our justice and charity; Them that are drawn
unto death, and those that are ready to be slain: They especially, but (...)
also all others that are in their condition in any kind or degree; those that
are injured or oppressed, or in danger to be injured or oppressed by any manner
way or means. Secondly, an act of Charity and justice to be performed toward
those that are in such a condition, by such, as (by reason of the power and
opportunities and other advantages that duty it self: viz. to look upon them in
the day of their adversity, and to deliver them out of the hand of their
oppressors. Thirdly, a possibility of the neglect or nonperformance of this
so just forbearance: If thou forbear to deliver. Fourthly, the true immediate
cause of that neglect, wheresoever it is found; viz. the want of spirit and
courage in the heart, faint-heartedness: from whatsoever former ot remoter
cause that faintness may proceed, whether a pusillanimous fear of the
displeasure, or a desire to wind himself into the favor of some great person;
or the expectation of a reward; or a loathness to interpose in other men's
affairs; or mere sloth and a kind of unwillingness of putting himself to so
much trouble; or what ever other reason or inducement can be supposed. If thou
faint in the day of adversity. the censure of that neglect: it is an evident
demonstration ( a posteriori, and as all other visible effects are of their
more inward and secret causes,) a certain token and argument of a sinful
weakness of mind; If thou faintest, etc. thy strength is small.

4. The result of these particulars amount in the whole to this. Every man,
according to his place and power, but especially those that being in place of
magistracy and judicature are armed with public authority for it, are both in
Charity and justice obliged to use the utmost of their power, and to lay hold
on all fit opportunities by all lawful means to help those to right that suffer
wrong; to stand calamity and distress; and to set in for them thoroughly and
stoutly in their righteous causes: to protect them from injuries, and to
deliver them out of the hands of such as are too mighty, or too crafty for
them, and as seek (either by violence or cunning,) to deprive them either of
their lives or livelyhoods. Briefly thus, and according to the language of the
Text; It is our duty every one of us, to use our best strength to deliver the
oppressed: but our sin, if we faint, and forbear so to do. And the making good,
and the pressing of this duty, is like to be all our business at this time.

Philosophers and Lawgivers have owned it as a beam of the light of Nature:
insomuch as even in their account he that Injustitiae duo genera: alterum
eorum, qui, cum possunt, non propulsant injuriam, -- etc Cic. 3. offic.
abstaineth from doing injuries has done but the one half of that which is
required to complete Justice; if he do not withal defend others from injuries,
when it is in his power so to do. But of all other men our Solomon could least
be ignorant of this truth. Not only for that reason, because God had filled
his heart with a large measure of wisdom beyond other men: but even for this
reason also: that being born of wise and godly parents, and born to a kingdom
occasions enough whereon to exercise all the strength he had;) he had this
truth (considering the great usefulness of it to him in the whole time of his
future government) early distilled into him by both his parents, and was
seasoned thereinto from his childhood in his education. His father David in
Psalm. 72. which he penned of purpose a Psalm for Solomon:) begins the Psalm
with a prayer to God both for himself and him, [ Give the King thy judgments O
God, and thy righteousness unto the Kings son.] And then after shows for what
end he made that prayer, and what should be the effect in order to the Public,
if God should be pleased to grant it. [ Then shall he judge the people
according unto right, and defend the poor, ver. 2. He shall keep the simple
folk by their right, defend the children of the poor, and punish the wrong
doer; or (as it is in the last translation,) break ver. 4. and after at the 12.
13. and 14. verses (although perhaps the passages there might principally look
at Christ, the true Solomon, and Prince of peace, a greater then Solomon, and
of whom Solomon was but a figure; yet I believe they were also literally
intended for Solomon himself) He shall deliver the poor when he cries, the
needy also, and him that has no helper. He shall be favorable to the simple
and needy, and shall preserve the souls of the poor. He shall deliver their
souls from falsehood and wrong; and dear shall their blood be in his sight. And
the like instructions to those of his father, he received also from his mother
in the prophecy which she taught him, with much holy wisdom for the matter,
and with much tenderness of motherly affection for the manner, ( What? my Son!
and what, the Son of my womb! and what, the Sons of my vows.) Proverbs 31.
where she gives him this in charge verse. 8.9. Open thy mouth for the dumb in
the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction: Open thy mouth, judge
righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy.

6. For the farther evidencing of the necessity of which Duty, that so we may
be the more effectually quickened to the cheerful and conscionable performance
of it: there are sundry important whether reasons, or inducements, or both (for
we shall not now stand so much upon any nice distinguishing of the. terms; but
take them togetherward the one sort with the other:) very well worthy our
Christian consideration. Some in respect of God, some in respect of our selves,
some in respect of our Brethren, and some in respect of the Thing it self in
the effects thereof.

7. To begin with the most High: we have his Command first, and then his
Example, to the same purpose. First his Command: and that very frequently
repeated both in the Law of Moses, and in the Psalms, and in the Prophets. I
shall the less need to cite particular places; since that general and
fundamental law, which is the ground of them all, is so well known to us: even
that, which our Savior makes Mat. 22.39.
the second great Commandment, that Jam. 2.8.
(...), as St James calls it, that royal Law, Thou shall love thy Oh, how we
can stickle in our own Causes! and solicit our own business with unwearied
diligence! How active, and provident, and vigilant we can be, in things wherein
our selves are concerned, or when our own lives or livelihoods are in jeopardy!
Not giving sleep to our eyes, or slumber to our eyelids, till we have delivered
our selves from the snare of the Oppressor, Prove. 6.5.
as a Roe from the hand of the hunter, or as a bird from the snare of the
fowler! Now if we can be thus fiery and stirring when it is for our selves, but
frozen and remiss when we should help our neighbor: how do we fulfill the royal
Law according to the Scripture, Thou shall love thy neighbor; as thy self?

the Lawyers question Luke 10. Luke 10.29.
But who is my neighbor? Or with the Pharisees evading Gloss, Mat. 5. Mat.
5.43.
Thou shall love thy neighbor? My neighbor, true: but not mine enemy. Or with
Nabals churlish reasoning 1 Samuel 25. Shall I put my self to pains and trouble
for 1 Samuel 25.11.
men whom I know not whence they be? For in all the Cases, wherein the offices
whether of Justice or Charity are to be exercised, every man is every other
man's neighbor. All men being by the ordinance of God so linked together, and
concorporated one into another: that they are not only all 1 Cor. 12.12.
members of the same body, (of the same civil body, as they are men; and of the
same mystical body too, if they be Christians;) but even members also Ephesians. 4.25.
one of another, Ephesians. 4. yea even Romans 12.5.
every one one another members Romans 12. So that if any man stand in need of
thy help, and it be in the power of thy hand to do him good: whether he be
known to thee, or a stranger, whether thy friend, or thy foe; he is a limb of
thee, and thou a limb of him. He may challenge an interest and a property in
thee; as Deuteronomy. 15.11*
thy poor, and thy needy, Deuteronomy. 15. Yea more, as Esaias 58.7.
thine own flesh, Esaias 58. Thou may not therefore hide thy self from him,
because he is thine own flesh. For thy flesh thou art bound though nourish and
to cherish it; by affording all convenient succor and supply to the
necessities of it.

9. God then has laid upon us his royal command in this behalf. Nor so only,
but he has also laid before us a royal president in his own blessed example.
Psalm. 10.17, 18.
Lord, thou have heard the desire of the poor; to help the fatherless and poor
unto their right, that the man of the earth be no more exalted against them.
Psalm. 10. says David for the time past. And for the time to come Psalm. 140. --
140.12.
Sure I am that the Lord will avenge the poor, and maintain the cause of the
helpless. If you would hear it rather from his own mouth; take it from Psalm. --
12.5.
Now for the comfortless troubles sake of the needy, and because of the deep
sighing of the poor, I will up says the Lord, and will help every one from him
that swells against him, and will set them at rest. You see which way your
heavenly father goes before you: Now Ephesians. 5.1.
be ye followers of God as dear children. It is the hope of every good
Christian, that he shall hereafter be like unto God in glory and happiness:
like unto God in grace and goodness; in being Luke 6.36.
merciful as his heavenly father is merciful; in Psalm. 146.8, 9.
caring for the strangers, and defending the fatherless and widow; in helping
those to right that suffer wrong; and in doing works of piety, and charity, and
mercy. The duty concerns all in general.

10. But Princes, Judges, Magistrates, and all that are in authority, are more
specially engaged to follow the example of God herein: since God has been
pleased to set a special mark of honor upon them, in vouchsafing to put his
own name upon them, Petty-Gods upon earth, Psalm. 82.6.
Dixi Dij, I have said ye are Gods, Psalm. 82. Not so much (be sure) for the
exalting of their Power, and to procure them due honor, esteem, and obedience
from those that are under them, (though that also no doubt was intended
thereby:) as to instruct them in their Duty, and eftsoons to remember them,
that they are very unworthy the glorious title they bear of being Gods, if they
do not imitate the great and true God, by exercising their God-ships (if I may
so speak) in doing good, and protecting innocence: Flaterers will be ready
enough to tell you, You are Gods: but it is to evil and pernicious
omnipotency. You are Gods, and therefore may do what you will, without fear in
your selves, or control from any other. They that tell you so with such an
intention, are liars: and you should not give them any countenance, or credit,
or so much as the hearing. But when the God of truth tells you, Ye are Gods;
he tells you withal in the same place (and as it were with the same breath)
what you are to do answerably to that Title, and by what evidence you must
approve your selves to be Gods. -- 3 4.
Defend the poor and fatherless, says he in that Psalm; See that such as be
This premised, it then follows (one verse only interserted) -- 6.
I have said, Ye are Gods. As if he had said; So do, and then you are Gods
indeed: but without this care, you are Idols, and not Gods. Much like the Idol
Gods of the heathen, Psalm. 115.5, 6.
that have eyes and see not, ears and hear not; mouths and speak not: that have
a great deal of Worship from the people, and much reverence, but are good for
nothing. By this very argument in Baruc 6. are such Idols disproved to be Gods.
Baruc. 6.^6. -- 40.
They can save no man from death, neither deliver the weak from the mighty.

11. I hope the greatest upon earth need think it no disparagement meanest
brethren, and to stoop to their necessities: when the great God of heaven and
earth, Psalm. 113.5. (...) -- 7.
who has his dwelling so high, yet humbles himself to behold the simple that
lie as low as the dust, and to lift up the poor that sticks fast in the mire.
-- 102.19.20.
The Lord looked down from his Sanctuary: from the heaven did the Lord behold
the earth; That he might hear the mournings of such as be in captivity, and
deliver the children appointed unto death. So then, for the performance of this
duty, thou have Gods commandment upon thee, and thou have Gods Example before
thee. If there be in thee any true fear of God, thou will obey his command: and
if any true hope in God, follow Example.

12. If from God we look downward in the next place upon our selves; and duly
consider either what power we have, or what need we may have: from both
considerations we may discover yet farther the necessity of this Duty. And
first from our Power. There is no power but of God: and God bestows no power
upon man (nor indeed upon any creature whatsoever) to no purpose. The natural
powers and faculties, as well of our reasonable souls, as of our Organicall
bodies; they have all of them their several uses and operations, unto which
they are designed: And by the principles Power, but in order and with reference
to Act. Look then what power God has put into any of our hands in any kind,
and in any measure; it lies us upon, to employ it to the best advantage we
can, for the good of our brethren: for to this very end God has given us that
power what ever it be, that we might do good therewithal. The Lord has in his
wise providence so disposed the things of this world, that there should ever be
some rich, to relieve the necessities of the poor; and some poor, to exercise
the charity of the rich. So likewise he has laid distresses upon some, that
they might be succored the power of others: and lent -- (...). Eurip. Hecub.
act. 5. Psalm. 62.11. -- 2. -- 79.12.
power to some, that they might be able to succor (...) distresses of others.
Now as God himself, to whom all power properly and originally belongs,
delights to manifest his power rather in showing mercy, then in works of
destruction ( -- God spoke once, twice have I heard the same, that power
belongs unto God, and that thou Lord art merciful Psalm. 62. -- O let the
sorrowful sighing of the prisoners come before thee: according to the greatness
of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die. Psalm. 79.) So all
those upon whom God has derived any part of that power, should consider that
God gave it them for edification, 2 Cor. 13.10.
destruction; to do good withal, and to help the distressed, and to save the
innocent: not to trample upon the poor, and oppress those that are unable to
resist. Pestifera vis est, valere ad nocendum. It is in truth a great weakness
in any man, Senec.
rather then a demonstration of power, to stretch his power for the doing of
mischief. An evident argument whereof is, that observation of our Solomon in
Prove. 28. confirmed also by daily experience: Prove. 28.3.
that a poor man, that oppresses the poor, is ever the most merciless
oppressor. It is in matter of Power many times, as it is in matter of
Learning. They that have but a smattering in schollership, you shall ever
observe to be the forwardest to make -- quicquid illud possunt, statim
ostendunt. Quintil. 1. Instit. 3. (...). Arist. de mundo cap. 1.
ostentation of those few ends they have: because they fear there would be
little notice taken of their learning, if they should not now show it when they
can. And yet (you may observe that withal) it oftentimes falls out very
unluckily with them: that when they think most of all to show their
schollership, they then most of all (by Ignorance. It is even so in this case;
Men of base spirit and condition, when they have gotten the advantage of a
little power, conceive that the world would not know what Senties qui vir siem.
Terrent.
goodly men they are, if they should not do some act or other whereby to show
forth their power to the world. And then, their minds being too narrow to
comprehend any brave and generous way whereby to do it; they cannot frame to
do it any other way, then by trampling upon those that are below them* and
that they do beyond all reason, and without all mercy.

13. This Argument, taken from the end of that power that God gives us, was
wisely and to good purpose pressed by Mordecai Esth. 1. to Queen Esther; when
she made difficulty to go into the Presence, to intercede for the people of
the Jews, after that Haman had plotted their destruction. Who knows, says he
there, whether thou art come to the Kingdom for such a time as this? Ester 4.14.
As if he had said; Consider the marvailous and gracious providence of God, in
raising thee, who were of a despised nation and kindred, to be partaker with
the most potent Monarch in the world, in the royal Crown and Bed. Think not
but the Lord therein certainly intended some great work to be done by thy hand
and power for his poor distressed Church. Now the hour is come: Now (if ever)
will it be seasonable for thee, to make use of those great fortunes God has
advanced thee to, and to try how far (by that power and interest thou have in
the Kings favor) thou can prevail for the reversing of Hamans bloody decree,
and the preserving our whole nation from utter destruction. And of this
Argument there seems to be some intimation in the very Text, as those words
in the twelfth verse may (and that not unfitly) be understood; He that keeps
thy soul, does not he know it? That is, He that has preserved thee from
falling into that trouble and misery, whereinto he has suffered thy distressed
brother to fall; and has kept thee in safety and prosperity for this end, that
thou might the better be able to succor those that are helpless: does not
he take knowledge, what use thou make of that Power, and whether thou art thy
brothers good, yea or no?

14. Neither yet only look at the Power thou now have: but consider withal,
what need thou may have of the help of others hereafter. The world is full
of (...). Arist. 4. Phys.
changes and chances: and all things under the sun, are subject to rolling.
Thou who by reason of thy present power art now sought and sued to by others;
by a thousand casualties, more thou can imagine, may be brought to crave
help from others. Now the Rule of Equity is, Do as thou would be done to.
As thou would expect help from those that are able to succor thee, if thy
self stoodest in need: so be ready, now it is in thy power to do it, to succor
those that help, and expect it from thee. Learn by that speech of Joseph's
brethren, when they were distressed in Egypt Genesis 42. ( We were verily guilty
concerning our brothers, Genesis 42.21.
in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not
hear: therefore is this distress come upon us.) Learn I say from that speech
of theirs, what a dreadful pang and torture and corrosive it will be to thy
conscience hereafter in the day of thy calamity, when thou shall sue to others,
and find but cold comfort from them: if thy heart can then tell thee, that
though men be hard, yet God just; and that with what measure thou metedst to
others before, it is now measured back again (with advantage perhaps) into
thine own bosom. To prevent which misery; learn wisdom of the unjust steward:
even to make thee friends of thy mammon, and of thy power, and of all those
blessed opportunities and advantages thou enjoyest, by doing good with them
whilst thou have time. That when the tide shall turn, thou may also find
friends to help in time of need, to stand by thee in the day of adversity, and
to deliver thy soul from unrighteous Judges. He that would readily find help,
it is but meet and right he should readily lend help.

third place, to those poor oppressed ones, to whom (as a fit object for our
justice and charity, to be exercised upon) we owe this duty of succor and
subvention. From whose condition we may find sundry farther excitements to the
performance of this duty: if we shall consider the greatness of their
distress, the scarcity of their friends, and the righteousness of their Cause.
Whereof the first proceeds from the Cruelty, the second from the Potency, the
third from the avarice, ambition, or other iniquity of their oppressors.
First, many the distresses of poor men under the hand of their oppressors are
grievous, beyond the imagination of those that never felt them. They are
expressed in the Text (whether by way of Synecdoche, one special kind being
put to include all the rest; or by an hyperbolical amplification for the fuller
expressing of the grievousness thereof:) by the terms of Death, and Slaughter.
[If thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn to death, and those that are
ready to be Verily oppressors are covetous: and they that are covetous are
cruel too. For though their aim be the spoil, and not the blood: yet rather
then fail the spoil, they will not stick at the blood too. Come let us lay wait
for blood. Prove. 1.11. -- 13.
-- We shall fill our houses with spoil, Prove. 1. And so the oppressor proves
both a thief and a murderer: a thief, in the end he aims at; and a
murderer, in the means whereby to obtain it: 1 King. 21.15
as, Ahab took away Naboths life, that he might enjoy his vineyard. Now surely
that man has very little compassion in his bowels, that will not set forward a
foot, nor reach out a hand, nor open a lip, to save the precious life of his
poor brother, when Deuteronomy. 22.4.
Were it but an Ox, or an Ass, or some beast of less value, that lay weltred
in a ditch: common humanity will require, we should lend our hand, and put to
our best strength, to draw him out. Xenocrates -- (...). Laert. lib. 4. cap. 2.
made scruple of hurting the Sparrow that flew into his lap, when a Hawk
pursued it. And ought not we then much more to set our selves with that power
we have by all lawful means to deliver our brother from the snare, and from the
pit of destruction?

16. Ey, you will say. If it were to save a man's life, much might be: we would
then strain our selves a little to speak, or to do, for him. But that is a case
seldom happens in a settled government, oppressions of those times are of a
lower nature: and we are not bound by the Text to set in, but in the case of
life. In petty grievances may we not leave men to the course of the Law, and to
shift as well as they can for themselves? we would be loath to get the
displeasure of some great ones we live near, and hold fair correspondency with,
when we need not, and -- cur ego amicum. Offendam in nugis. Horat. in Art. Mat.
5.21.27.
for trifles. For answer; First, although the Text speak expressly only of
Death: yet by a Synecdoche membri usual in the Scriptures, all other violences
and injuries are intended. As in the Law, under the name of murder, adultery,
fornication and all other uncleanness are forbidden. Secondly, though
oppressions should not be directly intended in the Text: yet might they be
inferred from it by the rule of proportion, and for the reason of equity. For
where there is the same reason of equity, (as in the present case) although
with some difference of proportion or degree: there is also the same obligation
of duty, the said difference of proportion or degree still observed. But indeed
Thirdly, I take it that all oppressions are not only intended, but also
expressed under the names of death and slaughter. Because to take away a
substance whereby he should maintain his life, is interpretative and to common
intendment all one as to take away the very life it self. Genesis 4.10. James 5 4.
Esaias 3.15.
Therefore as Abels blood cries; so the laborers wages cries. And the
Scriptures so speak of oppressors, as of those that grind the that eat them
up by morsels; or that (to save the labor of chewing,) swallow them up whole,
as the greater fishes do the small ones: Amos 8.4.
by which means they make the poor of the land to fail, as the Prophet
speaks. That which maintains life, is not only according to the phrase of
the world in most languages, but even in holy Scriptures themselves sometimes
so mentioned, as if it were the (...) Luke 15.12.

-- (...). Luke 21.4. Sirac. 34 21, 22.


very life it self, the substance, essence, or being of a man. And he that
should violently take away that from another, if the wise son of Sirac were of
the inquest, would certainly be found guilty of no less then murder. Hear his
verdict in The bread of the needy is their life: he that defraudeth him thereof
is a man of blood. He that takes away his neighbors living slays him: and
he that defraudeth the labourer of his hire, is a bloodshedder. Ecclesiasticus
34.

17. And as these poor ones deserve our pity and our help, in regard of the
grievousnes of their distresses: so are we secondly bound so much the more to
endeavor to succor them, by how much the more they are distitute of friends or
other means whereby to relieve or help themselves. The scriptures therefore
especially commend to our care and protection, the stranger, the fatherles, and
the widow, for these are of all others the most exposed to the injuries and
oppressions friends to take their part: so that if men of place and power shall
not stick close to them in their righteous causes, they will be over borne and
undone. This Solomon saw with much grief and indignation: insomuch as out of
that very consideration he praised the dead that were already dead more then
the living that were yet alive. Eccles. 4. when viewing all the oppressions
that are done under the sun, he beheld the tears of such as were oppressed,
Eccl. 4.1, 2.
and they had no comforter: and on the side of their oppressors there was
power; but they had no comforter. Power, and might, and friends, and partaking,
opportunity for every great and good man, especially for every conscionable
Magistrate, to set in for Gods cause, and in Gods stead; and by the greatness
of his power to stop the course of violence and oppression; and to rescue out
of the hands of the mighty those that are marked out to destruction or undoing.
Then is it a fit time for him to buckle on his armor with Job, Job 29.14.
to gird himself with zeal and righteousness as with a breast plate,
gyant-oppressour,and not to give over the combat till he have broken the jaws
of the wicked, and plucked the prey out of his teeth. -- 17.
A good Magistrate should be, as he was, eyes to the blind, feet to the lame,
a husband to the widow, a father to the orphane, a brother to the stranger: in
St. Paul was (but in another sense) Omnia omnibus, all things to all men,
according to their several necessities and occasions, that by all means he
might at least save some from oppression and wrong.

18. But that which above all other considerations should stir up our
compassion to those that are in distress, and make us bestir our selves in
their behalf, is that which I mentioned in the third place; The Equity of their
Cause: when by the power and iniquity of an unjust adversary, they are in
danger to be over borne in a righteous matter. For unless their matters be good
and right: poor, their distresses never so great, we should not pity them, I
mean, not so to pity them, as to be assistant to them therein. For as in God;
so in every minister of God (every Magistrate,) and in every child of God
(every good man:) Justice and Mercy should meet together, Psalm. 85.10.
and kiss each other. Justice without Mercy, and Mercy without Justice: are
both alike hateful to God; both alike to be shunned of every good man and
Magistrate. Lest therefore any man should deceive himself, by thinking it a
glorious or a charitable act, to help a poor man howsoever: the Lord has given
an express prohibition to the contrary, Exodus Thou shall not countenance a poor
man in his Cause. That is, in a good cause shrink not from him: Exodus 23.3.
but if his cause be naught, let his poverty be what it will be, thou may
not countenance him in it. He that has respect of persons in judgment, cannot
but transgress: Prove. 24.23.
and he that respects a man for his poverty, is no less a respecter of
persons, then he that respects a man for friendship, or neighborhood, or
greatness, or a bribe. In this case, the Magistrate cannot propose to himself a
fitter or safer example, then that of God himself: who as he often professes
to have a special care over the stranger, and fatherless, and widow, and needy;
so does he often declare his proceedings to be evermore without respect of

19. That therefore, whilst we avoid the one extreme, (that of incompassion,)
we may not fall into the other (that of foolish pity:) it will be needful that
we rightly understand Solomon's purpose in the Text. For it may perhaps seem to
some to be here intended, that every man should do his utmost to save the life
of every other man, that is in danger to lose it. And accordingly many men are
forward (more then any good subject has cause to con them thanks for) to
deprecate the favor of the Judge for the saving heinous malefactor; or to sue
out a pardon for a wilful murderer, or say it be, but to help some busy crafty
companion to come fair off in a foul business. And when they have so done, as
if they had deserved Civica corona -- servati civis decus. Tacit. 3. Annal. vid
A. Gell. 5. Noct. Attic. 6 Plin. 16. not. hist. 4. Valor. max. 2.3.
a garland for their service: so do they glory among their neighbors at their
return from these great as^semblies, a proper man from the gallows, or helped a
good fellow out of the briars. Alas, little do such men consider, that they
glory in that, which ought rather to be their shame: such glorying is not good.
For albeit in the Text it be not expressedly so set down: yet must Solomon of
necessity be understood to speak of the delivering of such only, as are
unjustly drawn to the slaughter; and not of such malefactors, as by robberies,
rapes, murders, treasons, and other guiltinesses have justly deserved the
sentence of death by the Law. For we must so understand him here, as not to
make him contradict a wise King, to scatter the wicked, and to bring the wheel
over them; Prove. 20.26. -- 28.17.
and that he that has done violence to the blood of any person should fly to
the pit, and no man should stay him. Against murder the Lord provided by an
early Law Genesis 9. enacted and published before him, out of whose loins the
whole world after the flood was to be repeopled, (to show it was not meant for
a national and temporary ordinance, but for an universal and perpetual Law,)
whosoever sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed. Genesis 9.6.
And that Judges should be very shy and tender how they grant pardons or
reprivals Numb. 35. Number. 35.31.
Ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer, which is guilty of
death: but he shall surely be put to death. And there is a reason of it there
given also; For blood, says he, defiles the land: and the land cannot be
cleansed from the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed
it. Read that passage with attention: and if both forehead and conscience be
not harder then the nether millstone, thou can not have either the heart or
the face to glory in it as a brave exploit, who ever thou art that have been
the instrument to save the life of a murderer.

20. Indeed all offenses are not of that heinous nature that Murder is: nor do
they cry so loud for vengance, as Murder does: And therefore to procure
undeserved favor for a smaller offender^, is not so great a sin, as to do it
for murderers. But yet, so far as the proportion holds, it is a sin still.
Especially where favor cannot be shown to one man, but to the wrong and
grievance of some other; as it happens usually in those judicial
controversies that are betwixt party and party for trial of right: Or where
favor cannot be shown to an offender, but with wrong and grievance to the
public; as it most times falls out in criminal causes, wherein Solomon has
taught us, that as well he that justifies the wicked, Prove. 17.15.
as he that condemns the just, are an abomination to the Lord. Yea, and that
for any thing that appears to the contrary from the Text and in thesi (for
circumstances may make a difference either way in hypothesi) they are both
equally abominable. In doubtful cases, it is doubtlesly better Semper quicquid
dubium est, humanitas inclina^ in melius. Senec. ep. 81.
Mercy then to Severity: Better ten offenders should escape, then one innocent
person suffer. But that is to be conceived, only when things are doubtful, so
as the truth cannot be made appear: but where things are notorious and evident,
there to justify the guilty, and to condemn the innocent, are still equal
abominations.

21. That which you are to do then in the behalf of the poor is this: First, to
be rightly informed, and (so far as morally you can) well assured, that their
cause be just. For mean and poor people are nothing less, (but ordinarily much
more) unreasonable, then great ones are: and if they find the ear of the
Magistrate open to hear their grievances (as it very meet it should be,) they
will be often clamorous and importunate, without either cause or measure. And
if the Magistrate be not very wary and wise in receiving informations; the
country swain may chance prove too cunning for him, and make him but a stale,
whereby for himself to get the start of his adversary; and so the Magistrate
may (in fine and unawares) become the instrument of oppression, even then when
his intention was to vindicate another from it. The truth of the matter
therefore to be first thoroughly sifted out, the circumstances the legal as the
equitable right examined and compared: and this to be done with all requisite
diligence and prudence, before you engage in the poor man's behalf.

22. But if, when this is done, you then find that there is much right and
equity on his side; and that yet for want of skill, or friends or means to
manage his affairs he is in danger to be foiled in his righteous cause: Or if
you find that his adversary has a legal advantage of him; or that he has (
de rigore) incurred the penalty of some dis-used statute, yet did not offend
wilfully out of the neglect the simplicity of his heart; (as those two hundred
Israelites that followed after Absalom when he called them, 2 Samuel 15.11.
not knowing any thing of his conspiracy, had done an act of treason, yet were
not formally traitors:) In either of these cases, I say, you may not forsake
the poor man, or despise him, because he is poor or simple. But you ought so
much the rather to stick by him, and to stand his friend to the utmost of your
power. You ought to give him your counsel, and your countenance; to speak for
him, and write for him, and ride for him, and do for him: to procure him right
against his adversary in the former case, and in the later case favor from the
Judge. In either case to hold back your hand, to draw back your help from him,
if it be in the power of your hand to do him any help; is that sin, for which,
in the judgment of Solomon in the Text, the Lord will admit no excuse.

reasons or motives taken from the effects of the duty it self. If carefully
and conscionably performed: it will gain honor and estimation both to our
persons and places; purchase for us the prayers and blessings of the poor; yea,
and bring down a blessing from God, not upon us and ours only, but upon the
State and Commonwealth also: But where the duty is neglected, the effects are
quite contrary. First, do you know any other thing, that will bring a man more
glory and renown in the common opinion of the world; then to show forth at once
both justice and mercy, by doing good, and protecting the Let not mercy and
truth forsake thee, bind them about thy neck, write them upon the table of thy
heart: Prove. 3.3, 4.
so shall thou find favor and good understanding (or acceptance) in the sight
of God and man, Prove. 3. As a rich sparkling Diamond adds both value and
luster to a golden ring: so do these virtues of justice and mercy well
attempered bring a rich addition of glory to the crowns of the greatest
Monarchs. Hoc reges habent magnificum and ingens, prodesse miseris, Senec.
supplices fido lare protegere, etc. Every man is bound by the Law of God and
of charity, as to give to every other man his due honor, so to preserve the
honor that belongs to his own person and place: for charity, in performing
the duties of every Commandment, begins judicature, or sustain the persons
of Magistrates, to hold up the reputation both of your persons and places, and
to preserve them from scorn and contempt. Execute judgment and justice with
wisdom and diligence: take knowledge of the vexations of those that are brought
into the Courts, or otherwise troubled without cause: be sensible of the groans
and pressures of poor men in the day of their adversity: protect the innocent
from such as are too mighty or too crafty for him: hew in pieces the snares,
and break the jaws of the cunning and cruel oppressor: and deliver those that
are drawn either to death, or undoing.

24. The course is preposterous and vain, which some men ambitious of honor
and reputation take, to get themselves put into the place of magistracy and
authority, having neither head nor heart for it. I mean, when they have neither
knowledge and experience in any measure of competency to understand what
belongs to such places: not yet any care or purpose at all to do God, their
King, and Country good service therein. The wise son of Sirac checketh such
ambitious spirits for their unseasonable Sirac 4. Seek not of the Lord
preeminence, Sirac. 7.4.
neither of the King the seat of honor. Think not he has any meaning to
dissuade or dis-hearten men of quality and parts for meddling with such
employments: for then the service should be neglected. No: men that are gifted
for it, although the service cannot be attended without some both trouble and
charge; yet should not for charge or trouble, (indeed they cannot without sin)
seek either to keep themselves out of the Commission, or to get themselves off
again being on. His meaning clearly is, only to repress the ambition of those
that look after the Title, because they think it would be some glory to them:
but are not able, for want either of skill or spirit, or through sloth not
willing, to perform the duties. And so he declares himself a little after
there; Seek not to be a Judge, being not able to take away iniquity: lest at
any time thou fear the person of the mighty, -- 6.
and lay a stumbling block in the way of thy uprightness.

25. Did honor indeed consist (which is the ambitious man's empty Title: we
might well wish him good luck with his honor. But since true honor has a
dependence upon virtue, (being the wages, as some; or, as others have rather
chosen to call it, the shadow of it:) it is a very vanity to expect the one
without some care had of the other. Would any man not forsaken of his senses,
look for a shadow, where there is no solid body to cast it? or not of his
reason, demand wages, where he has done no service. Yet such is the
perverseness of our corrupt nature, through sloth and self-love; that what God
would the Honor and the Burden, we would willingly put asunder. Every man
almost would draw to himself as much of the Honor as he can: if it be a matter
of credit or gain; then, Why should not I be respected in my place, as well as
another? But yet withal would every man almost put off from himself as much of
the burden as he can: if it be a matter of business and trouble; then, Why may
not another man do it as well as I? Like lazy servants, so are we: that love to
be beforehand with their wages, and behind-hand with their work.

26. The truth is, there is an Outward, and the^e is an Inward The outward
honor belongs immediately to the Place; and the place casts it upon the
Person: so that whatsoever person holds the place, it is meet he should have
the honor due to the place, whether he deserve it, or not. But the Inward
honor pitcheth immediately upon the Person, and but reflecteth upon the Place:
and that honor will never be had without desert. What the Apostle said of the
ministry, is in some sense also true of the Magistracy: they that labor
faithfully in either, are worthy of double honor. 1 Timothy 5.17.
Labor, or labor not; there is a single honor due to them: and yet not so
much to them, as to their places and callings; but the double Honor, that
inward Honor of the heart to accompany the outward, will not be had, where
there is not worth and industry in some tolerable measure to deserve it. The
knee-worship, the cap-worship, and the lip-worship, they may have that are in
worshipful places and callings, though they do little good in them. But the
Heart-worship they shall never have; unless they be ready to do justice, and to
show mercy, and be diligent and faithful in their Callings.

27. Another fruit and effect of this duty where it is honestly performed, are
the hearty prayers and blessings of the poor: as on the contrary their bitter
curses and imprecations, where it is slighted or neglected. We need not look
far to find the truth hereof asserted in both the branches: we have Text for
it in this very ver. 24-26. He that says unto the wicked, Thou art righteous,
him shall the people curse, nations shall abhor him. But to them that rebuke
him shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come upon them. Every man shall
kiss his lips, that gives a right answer. Prove. 11.26.
As he that withholdeth corn in the time of dearth, having his garners full,
pulls upon himself deservedly the curses of the poor: but they will power out
blessings abundantly upon the head of him, that in compassion to them will let
them have it for their money; ( Prove. 11.) So he that by his place having power
and means to succor those that are distressed, and to free them from wrongs
and oppressions, will do them right; shall have many a blessing from their
mouths, and many a good wish from their hearts: -- 28.27.
but many more (...). Homer. Odyss. 4. -- 26.2.
bitter curses both from the mouth and heart, (by how much men are more
sensible of discourtesies then of benefits, and readier to curse then to bless)
if they find themselves neglected. And the blessings and cursings of the poor
are things not to be wholly dis-regarded. Indeed the curse causeless shall not
come: neither is the Magistrate to regard the curses of bad people so far, as
either to be deterred thereby from punishing them according to their desert, or
to think he shall fare ever the words are but wind; and as Solomon says
elsewhere, Ecl. 11.4.
He that observes the wind shall not sow; so he that regards the speeches of
vain persons; shall never do his duty as he ought to do. In such cases, that of
David must be their meditation and comfort, Though they curse, yet bless thou.
And as there is little terror in the causeless curses; Psalm. 109.28.
so there is as little comfort in the causeless blessings of vain evil men. But
yet where there is cause given, although he cannot be excused from sin that
curses, (for we ought to bless and to pray for, Romans 12.14.
not to curse, even those that wrong us and persecute us:) yet vae homini
withal, woe to the man from whom the provocation comes. curses, as they
proceed from the bitterness of the soul of the grieved person in the mean time:
so they will be in the end bitterness to the soul of him that gave cause of
grievance. And if there were not on the other side some comfort in the deserved
blessings of the poor; it had been no wisdom for Job to comfort himself with
it: as we see he did in the day of his great distress, The blessing of Job
29.13.
and I caused the widows heart to sing for joy* Job 29.

28. But say these poor ones should be so charitable (as very seldom they be,)
as not to curse us, when we have despised them; or so unthankful (as seldom
they are otherwise,) as not to bless us when we have relieved them: yet the
Lord, who has given every man a charge concerning his brother, and committed
the distresses of the poor to our care and trust, will take district knowledge
how we deal with them, and unpartially recompense us thereafter. Does not he
consider? and shall not he render to every man according to his the last words
of the Text. If therefore you have done your duty faithfully, let it never
discourage you, that unrighteous and unthankful men forget it. They do but
their kind: the comfort is, that yet God will both remember it and requite it.
Heb. 5.10.
God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love, says the
Apostle, Heb. 5. He will remember it you see. Psalm. 41.1.
And then says David Psalm. 41. Blessed is he that considers the poor and
needy: the Lord shall deliver him in the time of trouble. He will requite it
too. He that for Gods sake helps his poor brother to right that suffers
wrong, he does therein at once, first an act of mercy, because it is done in
the behalf of a distressed man; and an act secondly of justice, because it is
done in a and thirdly, (being done for the Lords sake,) an act of Religion also
( Pure religion and undefiled before God even the Father is this, James 1.27.
to visit the fatherless and widow in their affliction, James 1.) And is it
possible that God, who delights in the exercise of every one of them singly,
should suffer an act to pass unrewarded, wherein there is a happy concurrence
of three such excellent virtues together, as are Justice, Mercy, and Religion?
The Prophet Jeremy, to reprove Ieho^achins tyranny and oppression, upbraideth
him with his good father Iosiah's care and conscience to do justice, and to
show mercy, after this manner. Did not thy father eat and drink, Jer. 22.15, 16.
and then it was well with him? He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then
it was well with him: was not this to know me, says the Lord? But now on the
contrary, He shall have judgment without mercy, James 2.1.3. Prove. 21.13.
that shows no mercy. He that stops his ears against the cry of the poor,
he shall also cry himself, but shall no^ be heard, etc. Many other like
passages there are in the Scriptures to the same effect.

29. Nay moreover, the general neglect of this duty pulls down the wrath of
God, not only upon those particular persons that neglect it; but also upon the
whole nation where it is in such general O house of David thus says the Lord,
execute judgment in the morning, Jer. 21.12.
and deliver him that is spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor: lest my
fury go out like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of
your doings, Ier. 21. Brethren, we of this nation just wrath (though tempered,
as we must all confess, with much clemency;) yea and his hand is stretched out
against us still, in the heavy plagues both of dearth and death. Though the
land be full of all manner of sin and lewdness, and so the Lord might have a
controversy with us for any of them: yet I am verily persuaded, there are no
other kinds of sins, that have overspread the face of the whole land with such
an universal contagion (as it were of a Leprosy,) as the sins of Riot and
Oppression have done. Which two sins are, not only the provoking causes, (as
any kind of sins may be) the justice of God; but also the sensible
instrumental causes in the eye of reason and experience, of much penury and
mortality among us.

30. Surely then, as to quench the fire, we use to withdraw the fuel: so to
turn away the heavy wrath of God from us, we should all put to our helping
hands, each in his place and calling, but especially the Minister and the
Magistrate, the one to cry down, the other to beat down, as all sins in
general, so especially these of Riot and Oppression. Never think it will be
well with us, or that it will be much better with us then now it is, or that it
will not be rather every day much worse with us then it is; never look that
disorders the Church, distempers in the State, distractions in our judgments,
diseases in our bodies, should be remedied or removed, and not rather more and
more increased: if we hold on as we do, in pampering every man his own flesh,
and despising every man his poor brother. So long as we think no pleasures too
much for our selves, no pressures too heavy for our brethren; stretch our
selves along and at ease upon our couches, eat of the fat, and drink of the
sweet, Amos 7.4 -- 6.
without any touch of compassion in our bowels for the afflictions of others:
we can expect no other, but that the rod of God should abide upon us, either in
dearths or pestilences; or if they be removed (for God loves his rods,) in
greater and heavier judgments in some other kind.

31. But as to the particular of Oppression (for that of Riot and Intemperance,
being beside the Text, I shall no farther press:) my humble request to those
that are in place of authority, and all others that have any office or
attendance about the Courts, is this. For the love of God, and of your selves,
and your Country, Be not so indulgent to your own appetites and affections,
either of Ease, as to reject the complaints; or of Partiality, as to despise
the persons; or of filthy lucre, as to betray the cause of the fatherless and
friendlesse. his cause is good, a simple man to be circumvented by the
wiliness, or a mean man to be overpowred by the greatness, of a crafty or
mighty adversary. Favor not a known Sycophant; nor open your lips to speak in
a cause to pervert judgment, or to procure favor for a mischievous person.
Exodus 23.2.
Turn not judgment into wormwod, Amos 5.7. Esaias 29.21.
by making him that meant no hurt, an Wrangle not in the behalf of a
contentious person, to the prejudice of those that desire to live quiet in the
land. Devise not dilatory shifts to tug men on along in a tedious course of Law
to their great charge and vexation; but ripen their causes with all seasonable
expedition for a speedy hearing. In a word, do what lies in your power to the
utmost, for the curbing of Sycophants and oppressors, and the protecting of
the peaceable and innocent: use the sword that God by his deputy has put into
your hands, Romans 13.4, and 1 Pet. 2.16.
for the punishment of evil doers, and for the praise and safety of those that
do well. So shall the hearts of every good man be enlarged their tongues, to
honor you, and to bless you, and to pray for you. Then shall God power out his
blessings abundantly upon you and yours: yea, it may be upon others too, upon
the whole land, by your means, and for your sakes. The Lord by his Prophet more
then once has given us some comfortable assurance of such blessed effects to
follow upon such premises: The words are worthy to be taken notice of. Jer. 7.5
-- 7.
If you thoroughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbor, If you
oppress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent
blood in this place; Then will I cause you to dwell in this place for ever and
Jer. 7. And in Jer. 22. Execute ye judgment and righteousness, Jer. 22.3 -- 5.
and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor: and do no wrong,
do no violence to the stranger, the fatherless, nor the widow, neither shed
innocent blood in this place. For if ye do this thing indeed, then shall enter
in by the gates of this house Kings sitting upon the throne etc. But if ye will
not hear these words, I swear by my self says the Lord, etc.

32. Concerning which and other like passages frequent in the holy Prophets, I
see what may be readily opposed. True it is, will some say, where these things
are constantly and generally performed; a national judgment may thereby be
removed, or a blessing two or three of us, if we should set our selves to it
with all our strength, able to do toward the turning away of Gods judgments,
if there be otherwise a general neglect of the duty in the land? There is
something of truth I confess in this Objection: for doubtless those passages in
the Prophets aim at a general reformation. But yet consider first, we have to
deal with a wonderful gracious and merciful God, slow to anger and of great
kindness, Joel 2.13.
and such a one as will easily be induced to repent him of the evil. And who
can tell, but he may return and repent and leave a where but two or three in a
whole nation do (in conscience of their duty, and in compassion of the state,)
set themselves unfainedly to do justice, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly
with their God, though the generality should be corrupt? Especially, since we
have in the second place such excellent precedents of the riches of his grace
and goodness in this kind, upon record: that we might not be without hope, if
we do our part, though we were left even alone. God was ready to have spared
the five Cities of old Genesis 18. if there had been in them to be found but twice
so many righteous men. But he did actually spare Israel, Genesis 18.32.
by instantly calling in a great plague, which he had a little before sent
amongst them for their sins, upon one single act of justice, done by one single
man. Phinehes moved with an holy zeal, Psalm. 106.3.
did but stand up, and execute judgment upon two shameless offenders; and the
plague was stayed Psalm. 106. Add hereunto that most gracious proclamation
published Ier. 5. and you cannot want encouragement to Run to and fro through
the streets of Jerusalem, and see now and know, Jer. 5.1.
and seek in the broad places thereof, if you can find a man, if there be any
that executes judgment, that seeks the truth, and I will pardon it. Or say
thirdly, that the sins of a nation should be grown to that ripeness, that the
few righteous that are in it could not any longer adjourn the judgment, (for as
there is a time of Mercy, wherein the righteousness of one or a few may
reprieve a whole nation from destruction; so when the appointed time of their
fatal stroke is come, though Noah, Ezekiel. 14.14, 20.
they could prevail no farther then the delivery of their own souls:) yet even
there those that have been faithful shall have this benefit, that they shall be
able to say with comfort (either in the one sense or in the other) Liberavi
animam meam. That is, Ezekiel. 3.19.
they shall either be preserved from being overwhelmed in the common
destruction, having their life given them for a prey, and as a brand snatched
out of the fire, Jer. 39.18, and 45.5. Zach. 3.2.
as Noah escaped when all the world was drowned, and Lot from the deflagration
of Sodom: or if God suffer them to be involved in the public calamities, have
this comfort to sustain their souls withal, that they were not wanting to do
their part toward the preventing But howsoever, why should any man fourthly, to
shift off his duty, unseasonably obtrude upon us a new piece of Metaphysics,
which our philosophers hitherto never owned, in abstracting the general
reformation from the particulars. For what is the general, other then the
particulars together? And if ever there be a general reformation wrought; the
particulars must make it up. Do not thou then vainly talk of castles in the
air, and of I know not what general reformation: but if thou truly desire
such a thing, put to thy hand, and lay the first stone in thine own particular;
and see what thy example particulars move with thee, and so a general
reformation follow in some good mediocrity; thou have whereof to rejoice, that
thou had thy part ( a leading part) in so good a work. But if others will not
come on end cheerfully, so as the work do not rise to any perfection; thou have
yet wherewithal to comfort thee, that the fault was not thine.

33. Thus have you heard sundry reasons and inducements, to the duty contained
in the Text, of doing justice and showing mercy in delivering the oppressed.
Some in respect of God: who has given us, first his express command, to which
our obedience; and secondly, his own blessed example, to which our conformity,
is expected. Some in respect of our selves: because first whatsoever power we
have for the present, it was given us for this end, that we might therewithal
be helpful to others; and we know not secondly, in what need we may stand
hereafter of like help from others. Some in respect of our poor distressed
brethren, who deserve our pity and best furtherance: considering first the
grievousness of their pressures; secondly the paucity of their friends, but
especially and thirdly the equity and righteousness of their cause, when they
are in danger to be spoiled by the cruelty, potency, and iniquity of their
advrsaries. Some in respect of the duty it self: the fruits and effects whereof
ordinarily are, first honor and renown in the world; secondly, the blessings
and prayers of the poor; thirdly, the blessing of God upon us, and ours;
fourthly, the continuance of Gods mercies unto, and the reversing of Gods
judgments from the Land.

34. In the opening of which reasons, I have purposely pressed the duty all
along somewhat the more largely, that I might not application at the close: and
therefore I hope it will not be expected. I presume you would rather expect, if
we had time for it, that I should proc^ed to examine the usual excuses and
pretensions that are made in this case, when the duty has been neglected:
which Solomon has comprehended in those few words in the 12 verse, Behold we
knew it not; and withal referred them over, for the trial of what validity they
are, to the judgment of every man's own heart, as the deputed Judge under God;
but (because that may be faulty and partial) in subordination to a higher
tribunal, even that of God himself, from whose sentence there lies no the
duty. But having enlarged my self already upon the former point beyond my first
intention; I may not proceed any farther at this time: nor will it be very
needful I should, if what has been already delivered be well laid to heart.
Which God of his mercy vouchsafe, etc.

1. WE want Charity; but abound with Self-love. Our defect in that, appears
by our backwardness to perform our duties to our brethren: and our excess in
this, by our readiness to frame excuses intending in that particular whereat
the Text aims, to meet with us in both these corruptions, frames his speech
in such sort, as may serve best both to set on the Duty, and to take off the
Excuses. And so the words consist of two main parts: the supposall of a Duty,
which all men ought to perform, Excuses, which most men pretend for non
performance in the 12. Verse. Our Duty, it is to stand by our distressed
brethren in the day of their adversity, and to do our best endeavor, by all
lawful ways to prote^^ them from oppressions and wrongs, and to rescue them
out of the hands of those, that go about either by might or cunning to take
from them either their lives or livelihoods. [If (...) faint in the day of
adversity, thy strength is small: If thou forbear to deliver them that are
drawn to death, and those that are ready to be slain.] From which words I have
heretofore (upon occasion of the like meeting as this is,) spoken of the Duty
in this place: showing the and enforcing the performance of it, from sundry
important considerations; both in respect of God, and of Our selves, and of our
p^or Brethren, and of the Thing it self, in the blessed effects thereof: which
I shall not now trouble my self or you to repeat.

2. Taking that therefore now for granted, which was then proved; to wit, that
it is our bounden duty to do as has been said, but our great sin if it be
neglected I shall at this time (by Gods assistance, and with your patience)
proceed, as the Text leads me, to consider of the Excuses, in the remaining
words verse. 12. [ If thou say, Behold we knew it not: does not he that
pondereth the ] For the better understanding, and more fruitful applying of
which words; we are to enquire of two things: first what the Excuses are, which
Solomon here points at; and then of what value and sufficiency they are.

3. Many Excuses men have, to put by this and every other duty: whereof some
are apparently frivolous, and carry their confutation with them. Solomon
strikes at the fairest: whereof three (the most principal, and the most usual
of all) he seems to have Behold we knew it not.] As thus. Either first, we
knew it not: that is, we never heard of their matters; they never made their
grievances known to us. Or secondly, we knew it not: that is, we had no clear
evidence to give us full assurance, that their cause was right and good. Or
thirdly, we knew it not: that is, though to our apprehension they had wrong
done them, yet as the case stood with them, we saw not by which ways we could
possibly relieve them; we knew not how to help it.

4. These are the main Excuses: which of what value they are, is our next
Enquiry. Wherein Solomon's manner of rejecting them absolutely condemns them,
because they may be sometimes just; nor yet promiscuously allows of them,
because they are many times pretended without cause: but refers them over
for their more particular and due trial, double judicature. That is to say, to
the judgment of every man's heart and conscience first, as a deputy Judge under
God: and if that fail in giving sentence, (as being subject to so many
errors, and so much partiality, like enough it may,) then to the judgment of
God himself, as the supreme unerring and unpartial Judge, from whose sentence
there lies no appeal. Which judgment of God is in the Text amplified, by three
several degrees, or as it were steps of his proceeding therein: grounded upon
so many divine attributes or properties; and each fitted to other in so many
several Propositions. Yet those not delivered categorically and positively:
Emphasis to them,) put into the form of Negative Interrogations or Questions.
Does not he consider? does not he know? and shall not he render? That is, most
certainly and without all peradventure, he does consider, and he does know, and
he will render.

5. The first step of Gods judicial proceeding, is for Inquisition; and that
grounded upon his Wisdom: 1. [ Does not he that pondereth the heart consider
it?] As if he had said, The Lord is a God of admirable Wisdom, by whom are
weighed, not only the actions but also the Spirits of men, and their very
hearts pondered: Prove. 16*2. -- 21.2.
neither Enquiry. Trust not therefore to vain Excuses: for certainly thy heart
shall be thoroughly sifted, and thy pretensions narrowly looked into, when he
takes the matter into his consideration. 2. Does not he that pondereth the
heart consider it? The next step is for Deprehension, or Conviction: and that
grounded upon his knowledge or Omniscience. [And he that k^epeth thy soul, does
not he know it?] As if he had said, Thou may by colorable pretenses delude
men, who are strangers to thy soul, and cannot discern the thoughts and intents
of the heart. But there is no dissembling before him, Heb. 4.12, 13.
unto whose eyes all things are naked He that made thy soul at the first, and
has ever since kept it, and still keeps it, observing every motion and
inclination of it, he perfectly knows all that is in it: and if there be any
hidden guile in any secret corner of it, though obscured from man's search by
never so many windings and labyrinths, yet he will undoubtedly find it out. He
that keeps thy soul, does not he know it? 3. The last step is for
Retribution: and that grounded upon his Justice. [And shall shall not he render
to every man according to his works?] As if he had said, If mortal man were to
decide the matter, thou might have some hope, that time, and other means
that might be a gross fault, or to admit of a slender excuse. But God is a most
righteous Judge, not to be wrought upon by any artifice to do iniquity, or to
accept the persons of men. According therefore as thy works are, so without all
question shall thy doom be. Genesis 18.25.
Shall not the Judge of all the world do right? And shall not he render to
every man according to his

6. Thus you see the Text opened, and therewithal opened a large field of
matter, if we should beat out every particular. But that we may keep within
some reasonable bounds and within the time, we will hold us to these three
principal points or conclusions. First, that the several excuses before
mentioned, as supposed to be pointed at in the Text, may be sometimes pleaded
justly and reasonably; and in such case are to be admitted and allowed.
Secondly, that they may be also all of them, and are (God knows) too often
pretended, where there is no just cause for it. Thirdly, that causelessly
pretended, though they may blear the eyes of men, yet will they be of little
avail in the sight of God. Of each of these in the order as I have now proposed
them: and first of the first. [ If thou say, Behold we knew it not.]

7. Questionless if that allegation could never be just, Solomon would wholly
and absolutely have rejected it. Which since he has not done, but referred it
to judgment: we may conclude, there are times and cases, wherein it will be
allowed as a good and sufficient plea, if it shall be said, Behold we knew it
not. We esteem it the Fools buckler, (and it is no better, as it is many times
used,) to say, Non putaram. Yet may a right honest and wise man, without
buckle^, and to use it in his own just defense. When he is charged with it as
his crime, that his brother has been oppressed, and he has not delivered him:
be he a private man, or be he a public minister of justice, it will
sufficiently acquit him both in the judgment of God, and of his own heart, and
of all reasonable men, if he can say bona fide, as it is in the Text, Behold I
knew it not. The truth whereof I shall endeavor to make appear to you in each
of the three forementioned respects. First, men may matter of fact: or
Secondly, their judgments may be in suspense for point of right: or Thirdly,
where they perfectly comprehend both the whole business, and the equity of it,
there may lie such rubs in the way, as all the power and skill they have, will
not be able to avoid; so that though the cause be good, they cannot tell for
their lives which way to do good in it. In any of which cases, may they not
well say, Behold we knew it not?

8. First, they may want information for matter of fact. Not to speak of things
farther off, which therefore less concern us: of those things that are done
amongst them that live under us or near us, how knowledge? Much talk there is
indeed in all our meetings, and much bold censuring of the actions of those
that are above us, at every table. Yet much of this we take up but upon trust,
and the credit of flying reports, which are ever full of uncertainty, and not
seldom of malice: and false ground. But as for the affairs of them that are
below us, whereon especially the duty of the Text is to be exercised: other
then what we chance to hear of obiter; and by imperfect or partial relations,
very little thereof is brought to our ears, by way of just complaint, or
according to pure truth. And of all men, the greatest are sure evermore to know
the least. It is one of the unhappinesses of Princes and Magistrates, and all
that are in high place, that whereas all their speeches and actions are upon
the public stage, exposed to the view and censure of the very meanest; as a
Beacon on the top of a hill, open to every eye, and bleak to every wind:
themselves on the contrary can have very little true information abuses and
disorders in their inferiors, which it properly belongs to them both to
punish and reform. If in private families, which being of a narrow compass are
therefore easily looked into, L. Syllae Metella conjux, p^lam erat impudica: id
Athenis cantabatur, and Sylla ignorabat. Hier. 1. cont. Jovin.
the Master commonly be the last, that shall hear of what is amiss therein,
Juvenal. Sat. 10.
( Dedecus il^e d^mus sciet ultimus:) how much more then is it improbable in a
great Township, in a spacious County, in a vast Kingdom, but that manifold
nusances and injuries should escape the knowledge of the most vigilant and
conscionable Governors? When both Court and City and the whole Empire rang of
wanton Livia's impudent lasciviousness, and Messalina's audacious Silius: the
Emperors themselves, Augustus father to the one, and Claudius husband to the
other, heard nothing of either, till the news was stale every where else.
Principes omnia facilius, quam sua cognoscunt; says the Historian concerning
the one: and the Satyrist concerning the other, Juvenal. ubi sup^a
dum res nota urbi and populo contingat Caesaris aures. And no doubt but many
pious and gracious Princes, many grave and severe Magistrates, are better
persuaded of the faithfulness of those Officers they employ under them, and of
the honesty of those Servants they keep about them, then possibly they may
deserve; because they hear no complaints information, or but seasonable
intimation, what oppressions and exactions many times are either done by them,
or at least commonly suspected and rumoured among the people to have been done
by them; we cannot with charity think, but that they would soon make some
diligent enquiry into their dealings, and either displace them, or otherwise
duly chastise them, if they should be found faulty.

9. Now of this Ignorance in Governors and great ones, of the wrongs done to
poor men, there may be rendered sundry particular which yet all refer to two
heads. For poor men many times when they have a good mind to complain, want a
fit opportunity: and many times again having the opportunity, they have no
great mind so to do. For the first, they that do wrong, commonly are men of
power (on the side of their oppressors there was power, Eccl. 4.1.
Eccles. 4.) and men of Estate (do not the rich men oppress you? Jam. 2.6.
Jam. 2.) power and estate, by reason of their greatness, are fittest to
converse with great ones, and men of place: so that these hear little but what
they hear from those; because they have little communication (at leastwise not
in any free and familiar manner) with any but such as they are. And I ween such
men have not so little discretion, as to tell tales against themselves. Where
as meaner men cannot have the like opportunities, neither can be admitted into
the presence of those that are in authority at their own pleasures, to present
their grievances to them: neither indeed is it altogether fit they should. For
if mean men should have the like the higher powers, that great ones have: it
would create such molestation to the Magistrate, and breed such insolency in
the peasant, as could not be suffered. The Magistrate would soon grow weary of
his life; when he should be quite overwhelmed with multitudes of unmannerly and
importunate suitors, and that many times for very trifles, not worth the
speaking of. And the people would grow insolent with it beyond measure. For the
meaner ones are (to their power) nothing less unjust then the greater ones are:
but much more clamorous then they, and not to be satisfied with any reason, if
they might be heard when they would, and Courts, and Circuits appointed for the
administration of Justice* That so, neither on the one side the Magistrate be
over-cumbred, as he must needs be, if all suitors might have free access at all
times; nor yet on the other side poor men that sustain wrong, should be left
without remedy, as they must needs be if it were not at some times or other
free for them, to make their just complaints.

10. But then you would think at such times as these, wherein it is free for
any man that will to signify and to prosecute his grievances, open plea in the
Court, or by private petition to the Judge; that every man that is oppressed
should make his case known: so as no Magistrate could pretend want of
information. But yet it is not so. For many times (which is the other reason)
they that are wronged, though they have liberty to complain, are yet held off
from so doing upon other considerations. 1. Either they distrust themselves,
being but simple men, unskilled in the quillets of the Law; such as neither are
able to tell their own tale handsomely, nor have any friend whom they may trust
to do it heartily the Law is both costly and hazardous. There are so many
devices to adjourn a hearing, when all things are ready fetch about a business
again, when a man should think he had brought it to an end; to weary out a weak
adversary with torturing delays, especially if -- (...). Eu^p. in Orest. act.
5.
a poor man contend with a rich, or a plain-dealing man with a crafty
companion; (not to mention those fouler corruptions, suborned witnesses, packt
juries, and other-like enormities:) that they think it better to be quiet, and
to bear their pressures and griefs as well as they can, then to enter into a
tedious course of Law, whereof the charge is certain ( certain I mean to be
great, though how great it will be is uncertain enough) but the issue
altogether uncertain. 3. Or it may be they dare not complain, for fear of
incurring the farther of their potent or subtle adversaries: who perhaps, if
further provoked by meeting with opposition from them, might sit closer upon
their skirts then formerly, and do them a shrewder turn for it another day. And
therefore if they look for any favor from them hereafter (and from some
persons it must be looked upon as -- gloriantur latrones, ijs se vitam dedisse,
quibus non ademe^unt. Cicer. pro Milon.
a favor, by those that are not big enough to wrestle with them, that they do
them no farther harm;) they must resolve to sit down with the present loss,
suffer all and say nothing. Out of those and many other like considerations,
(more then I can think of, or if I could, then the time would suffer me to
present before the grieved party often forbeareth to complain. And then the
Magistrate being not made acquainted with the business, may justly say, Behold
we knew it not.

11. And as he may be ignorant in matter of fact, for want of due information:
so may he secondly be doubtful in point of right, for want of clear and full
evidence. Whereof also there may be diverse reasons: and among the rest these
which I shall now propose. First, the great diversity, yea sometimes flat
repugnancy and contrariety, that is between the informations on the one side,
and on the other. For men are extremly partial, and will not tell favor of
themselves, and to the prejudice of their adversaries, as they can devise to
do with any show of probability. We use to say, One tale is good, till another
be told: And the proverb is true, in that sense wherein it was first meant, and
is commonly understood. Solomon has a proverb much to the same purpose, [ He
that is first in his own tale seems righteous: Prove. 18.17.
but then his neighbor comes and searches him out. Prove. 18.] The meaning is
plain, One tale is good; that is, whether it be so or not, it seems so at the
first hearing. But if we will speak of things, not the appearance, but
according to truth, and pronounce of them as they are, and not as they seem:
may we not much rather invert the proverb, and say, One tale cannot be good,
till the other be told? That is, whether it be good or not, the Judge may not
give credit to either, till he has heard both. Nay, may we not many times
farther say, when both tales are told, that neither is Because there is
most-what in every man's tale a mixture of some falsehoods with some truths:
whereby it may so happen sometimes that he which has in truth the more equity
on his side, by the mingling in some easily discoverable falsehoods in telling
his tale, may render his cause the more suspicious to him that hears it, to
think the whole tale naught; and he that has indeed and upon the whole matter
the worse cause, may yet by the weaving in some evident truths or pregnant
probabilities in the telling of his tale, gain such credit with him that
hears it, that he will be very inclinable to believe the whole tale to be
good. Or howsoever, false, or at least both so equally doubtful: as no one
that hears them, can well tell whether of both to give credit to. It was so
in the famous case of the two inmate harlots, whereof King Solomon had the
hearing. 1 King. 3.16. etc.
The living child is mine, the dead one thine, says the one: No, says the
other, the dead child is thine, and the living mine. Here were presumptions on
both sides: (for why should any woman challenge another woman's child?) but
proofs on neither: (for being there were none in the house but they two,
neither of them could produce any witnesses. The case hung thus even: no more
evidence on the one side then on the other; no less confidence on the one
side, then on the other. Solomon indeed by that wisdom wherewith God had
endowed him in a transcendent measure, found out a means whereby to turn the
scales, to untie that hard knot, and to discover the hidden truth. But what
could a Judge or a Jury of no more then ordinary wisdom then have been able to
have said or done in such a case? but even to have left it as they found it?
And truly for any I know, Ignorance must have been their best excuse.

12. And as first in the Information, so there may be a defect secondly in the
Proofs. He that has the better cause in veritate rei, may yet fail his proofs,
and not be able to make it judicially appear the better Cause. In which case,
the old axiom holds, Idem est non esse and non apparere: it is all one in
foro externo, and as to the determination Quod probari non potest, mihi
infectum est. Bern. de praecept. and dispens.
of a Judge upon the Bench, who is to pronounce secundum allegata and probata:
for a man not to have a right, not to be able to make it appear in a legal way
and by such evidence as is requisite in a judicial proceeding, that he has
such a right. Or he may be outsworn by the depositions of the witnesses
produced on the behalf of the adverse part: though (it may be) utterly false;
yet direct and punctual against him, and Judge, but the great Judge of heaven
and earth, can certainly and infallibly know, when two or three men swear
directly to a point, and agree in one, whether yet they swear a falsehood or no?
Or what should induce a mortal Judge, not to believe them? especially, if the
proofs on the other side to fall short? And if in such a case, following the
evidence in the simplicity of his heart, he give away an honest man's right from
him to a Knave: he is not to be charged with it, as a perverter of justice, but
has his apology here ready fitted for him in the Text, Behold we knew it not.

13 Add hereunto in the third place, the great advantage or disadvantage that
may be given to a cause in the pleading, by the artificial insinuations of a
powerful Orator. That same flexanimis Pitho, and Suadae medulla, as some of
the old Heathens termed it, that winning and persuasive faculty which dwells
in the tongues of the affections of men, but to arrest their judgments also,
and to incline them whether way they please: is an excellent endowment of
nature, or rather (to speak more properly,) an excellent gift of God. Which
whosoever has received, is by so much the more bound to be truly thankful to
him that gave it, and to do him the best service he can with it: by how much he
is enabled thereby to gain more glory to God, and to do more good to humane
society, then most of his brethren are. And the good blessing of God be upon
the heads of all those, be they few or many, that use their eloquence aright;
and employ their talent in that kind for the advancement justice, the quelling
of oppression, the repressing and discountenancing of insolency, and the
encouraging and protecting of innocence. But what shall I say then of those, be
they many or few, that abuse the gracefulness of their elocution ( good
speakers, but to ill purposes,) to enchant the ears of an easy Magistrate with
the charms of a fluent tongue; or to cast a mist before the eyes of a weak
Jury, as Juglers make sport with Country people, to make white seem black, or
black seem white; so setting a fair varnish upon a rotten post, and a smooth
gloss upon a Protagoras sometimes boasted that he could make a bad cause good,
when he listed? By which means judgment is perverted, the hands of violence
and robbery strengthened, the edge of the sword of justice abated, great
offenders acquitted, gracious and virtuous men molested and injured. I know not
what fitter reward to wish them for their pernicious eloquence, as their best
deserved see; then to remit them over to what David has assigned them in
Psalm. 120. What reward shall be given or done unto thee, O thou false tongue?
Even mighty and sharp arrows, with hot burning coals. Psalm. 120.
I might add to those, how that sometimes by the subtilty of a cunning sly
Commissioner; sometimes by the wilful misprision of a corrupt, a negligent, or
the oversight of an ignorant Clerk; and by sundry other means, (which in regard
of their number, and my inexperience, I am not able to recite:) it may come to
pass, that the light of Truth may be so clouded, and the beams thereof
intercepted, from the eyes of the most circumspect Magistrate, that he cannot
at all times clearly discern the Equity of those Causes Apology that is left
him, is still the same as before; even this, Behold we knew it not.

14. But when he perfectly understands the whole business, and sees the
Equity of it, so as he cannot plead Ignorance of either: there may yet be
thirdly place for his just excuse, if he have not sufficient means wherewith to
relieve and to right his wronged brother. A mere private man, that is not in
place of authority, may bemoan his poor brother in the day of his adversity,
and give him his best advise (to the measure of his understanding) what to do:
but can otherwise do very little toward the delivering of him from the
mediating for him, as well as he can with that little power or interest he
has, either with the adversary, or with the Magistrate, that they would be
good to him. And that is ordinarily the utmost that such a person can do for
his poor friend: for he may not endeavor, beyond the warrant of his calling,
and the sphere of his power. Nay, he cannot do even that, with any great
confidence of success, unless he have some special interest either in the
Magistrate, or Adversary; especially if the Adversary be either a faithless, or
a fickle, or a captious, or a wilful man, (as few of those that molest others
wrongfully, this character:) yea, he may rather in that case fear, lest
possibly by his intervention he should but provoke the adversary the more, and
then he should by his Sedulitas illum, quem stulie diligit, urget. Hor. 2.
Epist. 1.
officiousness do his friend more harm then good.

15. Not to speak of infinite other impediments, and discouragements, that may
frustrate the good desires and endeavors of a mere private man concerning this
duty: let us consider how it is with more public persons; for they are the
men, upon whom especially I am now to press this duty. Such persons I mean, as
either are endued with public authority by virtue of their Callings,
Magistracy and Government: or else in regard of the eminency of their condition
in the places where they live, have some power among their tenants and
neighbors, to sway something with them. Even these also, both the one sort and
the other, may many times be destitute of requisite means and abilities, to
vindicate those whom they see and know to be wrongfully oppressed out of the
hands of their oppressors. Whereof there are, besides diverse other, these
apparent Reasons.

16. First the laws of men cannot foresee all the mischiefs that may be done in
a land: nor can they prevent all those they do Law of God, above all humane
Laws in the world. The Law of the Lord is perfect Psalm. 19. absolutely perfect,
to meet with all sinful aberrations whatsoever. But the best Laws, that ever
were devised imperfect; neither could provide against all emergent abuses and
inconveniences. I have seen an end of all perfection, says David again Psalm.
119. but thy Commandment is exceeding broad. Quam angusta innocentia est, ad
legem bonum esse? quanto latius officiorum patet, quam juris regula? Senec. 2
de ira. 27.
The Laws of men are but narrow things in comparison, and must of necessity
leave out more then they can take in: Gods Commandment only is broad enough to
take in all. For instance, I shall name you but one or two, of ten thousand.
The unconscionable racking of rents; the selling of cattle to poor husbandmen,
that have not their money ready to buy in the markets, upon a years day for
almost double the price; the underbuying of commodities far below the worth for
disbursing a little money grievous oppressions in themselves, and by the
Magistrate known so to be. Yet what can he do to help it; so long as the Laws
have provided no remedy there against? True it is, the Law of God reaches them
all: 1 Thessalonians. 4.6.
and therefore if any man go beyond or defraud his brother in any matter, or
in any manner, he must not think to escape unpunished, because the Laws of the
State under which he lives takes no conusance of any such matter. God, who
governs his own Law, and not according to man's Law, will undoubtedly be the
avenger of all such: But the Magistrate, who is to govern according to the
established Laws of his Country, must not stretch himself beyond his Rule; but
leave those evils that are without the reach of his authority, to the just
vengance of him to whom all vengance belongs.

17. Secondly, men's Laws are subject (besides that imperfection, Psalm. 94.1.
) to another great impotency, in this; That they cannot effectually provide
against those general inconveniences, for the preventing whereof they are
especially devised: without leaving a possibility particular mischiefs to fall*
and that right heavily sometimes upon, and much to the prejudice of, some
honest well deserving men. Now where a good subject, that means nothing but
well, is thus unhappily fallen under the heavy pressure of the Law; Quis est
iste, qui se profitetur omnibus legibus innocentem? Senec. 2. de ira. 27.
(and that may be any bodies case) a just and compassionate Magistrate may be
heartily sorry for him, and if it lie in his power to procure for him from a
higher power some mitigation of the Law, he will do his best to effect it. But
for the most part, especially where things are prosecuted eagerly and with
malice against the poor man; he cannot devise any means that may be effectual
to deliver him, himself into trouble, and the Laws into contempt, and of
opening a wide gap to the exercising of an arbitrary power by the Judge (then
which there is scarce imaginable any evil of more mischievous consequence in a
Commonwealth) and to many other mighty inconveniences.

18. There is yet a third vanity, whereunto ( the Law of God only Laws are
subject. That when they are made with as much advised deliberation, and drawn
up into a form of words with as much fullness, perspicuity, and caution, as the
wisdom of the best heads could possibly contrive: yet the nimble wit of man,
within the compass of a few months or years, will find out some hole or other
to creep out at; some slight evasion, whereby to slacken the sinews, and to
elude the force and intention of the same. By which means many times crafty
companions are set without the danger, and honest well-meaning men put beside
the benefit of those Laws, which were really intended for the curbing
protecting of the other; and the Magistrate cannot do withal.

19. These three reasons are taken from the quality of the Laws: I add but a
fourth, taken from the condition of the Times. A good Magistrate may have the
hap to fall into such evil times: that if he should attempt to do that service
to the public, by partaking with righteous, and opposing against unrighteous
men and causes, with that freedom that would well become him to do, if the
times were better, he should not only be sure to lose his labor, but be in
danger also to lose his place, by striving against the current to no inability
to do them good may be a reasonable excuse for him. But is not this to teach
the Magistrate to temporize? Or may he slug in his office, or desert his
bounden duty, for fear of Bug-bears, or by pretending there is a Lion in the
way? Nothing less. God forbid any man that occupies the place of the Lords
Messenger should utter a syllable of encouragement to any Magistrate, Prove.
26.^3.
to make himself a slave to the times; either by running with a multitude to do
any evil action for the winning of their favor, Exodus 23.2.
or by forbearing (out of a base fear and a faint heart) to do any good,
whereunto his power and opportunity will serve him.

20. But the thing I say is this. It is a point of Christian wisdom for a
Magistrate or any other man, if the Lord cast him upon evil times, to yield to
sway of the times so far, (provided ever, that it be done without sin,) as not
wilfully to deprive himself of the power and opportunities of doing the good he
can, by striving unseasonably to do more good then he can. The reason whereof
is grounded upon that well known Maxim, so generally allowed of by all Divines;
That affirmative precepts (such as this of delivering is) do not oblige ad
semper, at all times, and in all places, and with all circumstances, as
Negative precepts do. But for exercising the offices of such (affirmative)
precepts, there must be a due consideration had of the end, and of all
requisite Circumstances, to be laid together one against another in the
balance prudence: and according to the exigence thereof, the duty is for that
time to be either performed or omitted. Our Solomon tells us, Eccl. 3. that
there is a time for every thing; Eccl. 3.1. -- 11.
and that every thing is beautiful in its time: implying withal, that taken out
of the right time, nothing is beautiful. He says there also, that there is a
time to keep silence, and a time to speak. -- 7.
And surely the evil time is the proper time for keeping silence. Therefore the
prudent shall keep silence in that time, Amos 5.13.
for it is an evil time.

21. Now seeing that by so many several ways, as these which I Magistrates and
others may be excused for not helping those to right that suffer wrong: it
should make us all very watchful over our speeches, and sparing in our
censures, (wherein yet for the most part we take to our selves a mavelous
Liberty, a great deal more then becomes us,) concerning the actions and
dealings of our Governors. It is no wonder to hear lightheaded people, and
such as can look but a little way into the affairs of the world, clamorous: as
shallowest becks run with the greatest noise, and the emptiest vessels give the
lowdest sound. the times as bad as they are, to set their mouths wide open in
bitter invectives against their betters, and to be evermore declaming against
the iniquities of the times. But it grieveth my very soul, when I see men
otherwise discreet, and such as are in some reputation for virtue and
godliness, sometimes to forget themselves so much as they do, and to be so far
transported beyond the bounds of sobriety and duty, as to speak their pleasure
of those that are in place either of supreme, or of high (though subordinate)
authority: as if all were naught; every man ease, or his own gain, or his own
advancement; but none regarded to amend any thing amiss, or took to heart the
wrongs and sufferings of poor men.

22. To see the manifold oppressions that are done under the Sun even in the
best times, Eccl. 4.1. and 5.8.
(Solomon's reign was a time blessed with peace and plenty; yet did he complain
of the oppressions of the poor in his days, but for all that large measure
both of power and wisdom wherewith God had endowed him he could not remedy all)
will stir up in every man that has any holy warmth in him, a just indignation
there-against. But commonly (such is selvishness, we are most fiery, when the
mischief lights upon our selves, or upon those that stand in some near
relation to us. Therefore I cannot in charity but impute those excesses of such
men, to their zeal of justice, and indignation against those that either
pervert it, or but neglect it: but heightened through the violence of the
perturbation, to the distemper of Fury. Which makes me now and then to think
of those words of Solomon: which perhaps has another meaning, yet are very
fitly applyable this way, Eccles. 7.7.
in Eccles. 7. Surely oppression makes a wise man mad. For as a man, who
whilst he was master of his reason was quiet and companyable, fallen
afterward raging mad, raileth and strikes and flingeth stones about him,
sparing none that comes within his reach, be he never so good: little
otherwise does a wise man mis-behave himself (in his language) toward his
betters, when he is put a little as it were out of his right wits through the
distemper of some violent perturbation of mind, by a mis-no^mer zeal.

23. It would be some bridle both to our tongues and passions, seriously to
consider; that it becomes not the servant of God, to speak evil of Governments
or Governors openly, 2 Pet. 2.10.
though some things should be much amiss in the land, and little done in order
to the amending thereof: for that is a kind of blasphemy; for so the Apostles
word is. Openly did I say? I did so: because too often men do so. But the truth
is, the servant of God is not allowed by his Master to speak evil of dignities;
no not in his private chamber; Eccl. 10.20.
more yet; not so much as in his private thoughts. Much the infirmities of his
Governors to the wide world, for fear Cham's curse should light upon him: over
which he ought rather with blessed Sem and Iaphet to cast the mantle of
Charity, Genesis 9.22. etc.
to hide their nakedness from the eyes of scorners. Least of all to smite
Princes for Equity, and to cry out upon them as men that make no conscience of
the discharge of their duty in that their high calling, Prove. 17.26.
so long as they are careful in the generality to promote the execution of
Justice within their territories: only for suffering those evils, which they
cannot so easily remedy as we can observe; and for not doing that good, which
is not altogether in their power to do. So long as God is pleased to suffer
noisome corruptions to remain in the hearts of the best, and strong lusts to
reign in the hearts of the most; which will be so long as the world lasts: it
cannot be but often times offenses will come, disorders and abuses will grow,
right will be overborn by might, the plain-dealing will become a prey to the
crafty, wrongs and indignities will be offered; which the wisest and greatest
and godliest Magistrates shall never be able wholly either to prevent, or remedy.

24. Let it suffice thee, for the possessing thine own soul in patience, to
know; that all shall be righted one day. God will set straight at the last: but
that day is not yet. It is thy duty in the mean time, to pity thy superiors,
rather then to envy them, that have so much work to do, and yet are exposed
to censure and obloquie, as if they did nothing, because they do not that which
never yet any mortal man could do, in suppressing all oppressions. thy duty,
whatsoever actions of theirs may be capable of a just excuse, or of a fair
interpretation, to allow it them: and for what cannot be excused, to mourn for
them in secret, 1 Samuel 15.35.
but not to make a noise about them openly; when neither thy calling will
warrant thee, nor the hope of any good effect to follow upon it can encourage
thee so to do. If they say, Behold we knew it not: whether they say it truly,
or untruly, what is that to thee? The judgment of that, I find in my Text
referred to God, and to their own hearts: but no where to thee. Thou must take
it for a good excuse howsoever, and rest content therewithal.

Secondly, it may be some comfort to the soul of every godly man and
Magistrate, amidst all the oppressions and disorders that are done or suffered
in the land without redress; if his heart can tell him that he has not been
willingly accessory thereunto, but that he can truly say, Behold we knew it
not: that God will admit that his just excuse. God is not (and happy it is for
us that he is not) so hard in his righteous judgments, as we are too often in
our rash censures. He looks not to reap, where he has not sown: nor will he
demand an account of a talent, where none was disbursed: nor require of any man
above the proportion of that power, wherewith he has entrusted him; and of
those means and opportunities, which he a willing mind, and a faithful
endeavor, according to power, and as occasions serve, to do his duty
cheerfully in this, or any other kind: the Lord will graciously accept it,
according to that a man has, and not according to that he has not. Thrice
blessed therefore is that Magistrate, or other man who ever he be, that has
considered the poor and needy with a compassionate heart, Psalm. 41.1.
and -- prosilire libet in sorum; commodare alteri vo^em, alteri operam: etsi
nihil prosuturam, tamen conaturam prodesse. Senec. de tranquil. c. 1.
bent himself with all his strength to deliver them out of their oppressions
and troubles; although he have not been able to accomplish it to the full of
his desires: for he shall reap the reward of that which is done; and that which
is laid to his charge. Only, that he do not flatter himself with a false
comfort: let him be well assured first, that his Excuse will hold water, and
that his heart condemn him not as a liar, when he says, Behold we knew it
not. For this Excuse, though sometimes just, as we have now heard at large; yet
many times is pretended without cause: which is our next point, now to be
considered with more brevity.

26. If to pretend an excuse were sufficient to discharge a man from a fault:
amongst so many offenses as are in the world, we should have much a do to
find an offender. Those men that are work, are yet seldom to seek for an
excuse. The disease is Epidemical; I may say, Ecumenical too. We have it by
kind: derived in a perpetual line of succession, from the loins of our first
parents. Genesis 3.12. -- 13.
As Adam and Eve were not without their excuse ( The woman gave me; and The
serpent beguiled me,) so neither was bloody Cain, their firstborn without his,
( Am Genesis 4.9.
) Nor disobedient Saul without his, ( The people took of the chief things to
sacrifice to the Lord: 1 Samuel 15.15. 1 Samuel 25.11.
) Nor churlish Nabal without his, ( Shall I take my provision killed for my
Shearers, and give it to men I know not whence they be?) Nor, (that I may spare
the particulars, and take a world of them together,) will the whole crew of
cursed reprobates be without their excuse too, even then when the last sentence
is ready to be pronounced upon them, Matthew. 25.44.
( Lord, we never saw thee hungry, or thirsty, etc.) From Adam the first
sinner, who was then presently turned out of Paradise, unto the last damned
wretched, who shall be then presently turned into no sinful man but has at
sometime or other bewrayed the leaven of his natural hypocrisy, by excusing
his transgressions. Such a proneness there is in all the sons of Adam, Ad
excusandum excusationes in peccatis: that it may be said of all mankind, what
is written of the guests that were bidden to the great Supper, Luke 14. They
all began with one consent to make excuses. Luke 14.18.


27. The true Reason whereof is, that wretched pride, vainglory, and
hypocrisy, (from which we had all need to pray, Good Lord deliver us) which
cleaves so fast and inseparably to our corrupt natures. Whence it is, that
many men, who pass so little for consciences, yet stand so much upon their
credit: As Saul, who using no diligence to regain the favor of God, was yet
very solicitous, 1 Samuel 15.30.
that his honor might be preserved in the opinions of the people. Indeed, we
are neither careful to do well, nor willing to hear ill: Loath are we to leave
our sins; and we are as loath to own them. And therefore we throw cloaks over
them; that the outside may look comely howsoever, and the dishonesty that is
underneath may not be seen. Our Savior speaks of the Pharisees cloak of
hypocrisy; John 15.22. 1 Thessalonians. 2.5. 1 Pet. 2.16.
and S. Paul of a cloak of covetousness; and S. Peter of a cloak of
maliciousnes. They write of Plutarch in Lucul.
Lucullus, that out of his private wardrobe he furnished the Praetor (his
friend) for the adorning two hundred Cloakes: Horace plays the Poet, and
makes it up -- sibi millia quinque esse domi chlamydum. Horat. 1. ep. 6.
five thousand. Every one of us has the wardrobe of his heart plentifully
furnished with these cloakes; even beyond what the Poet could feign of him:
Cloakes of all sizes, Mark 10.50.
and for all purposes, and to fit all occasions. But as old Bartimeus cast away
his cloak, to follow Christ: so must we, if we will be Christ's disciples, cast
away from about us all these cloakes of vain pretensions and excuses. But that
we shall never do to purpose, unless we first cast out from within us that
pride and self-love, whose Cloaks are. The better we shall learn that first
great lesson of self-denial, the less will we seek to excuse our errors with
vain pretensions.

28. But the more apt we are by nature to justify our selves by causeless
excuses: the greater ought to be the care of every good excuses which he
pretends in his own defense. Whether they have justae excusationis instar,
and will bear a good and sufficient plea: or be but rather (...). Eurip.
shifts, devised to serve a present turn, more for outward show, then real
satisfaction within. Which is that Iudicium cordis, the judgment of the heart,
whereunto Solomon, as I told you, refers over this pretension (Behold we
knew it not) to receive its first and most immediate trial. Does not he that
pondreth the heart consider it? What the tongue pleads, is not a thing so
considerable with God, as how the heart stands affected.

29. For the approving his heart therefore in this business, before him that
knows it perfectly, and is able to ponder it exactly: let every Magistrate,
and other Officer of justice, consider in the fear of God. First, whether he
has been willing, (so far as his leisure amidst the throng of other his
weighty employments would permit,) to receive the petitions, and with patience
to hear the complaints of those poor men, that have fled to him as to a
Sanctuary for refuge and succor? Job 29.16.
Job professes himself to have been a father to the poor: and he is a very
unnatural father, that stops his against the cries of his children; or so
terrifieth them with his angry countenance, that they dare not speak to him.
Solomon in the twenty ninth of this book distinguishes a righteous man from a
wicked by this; that the righteous considers the cause of the poor, Prove.
29.7.
but the wicked regards not to know it. He that rejects their complaints,
or beats them off with bug-words and terror in his looks, either out of the
hardness of his heart, or the love of ease, or for whatsoever other respect;
when he might have leisure to give them audience, (if he were so minded,) and
to take notice of their grievances: cannot justly excuse himself by pleading,
Behold we knew it not. Secondly, whether he have kept his ear, and his
affection equally free to both parties: without suffering himself to be
possessed with prejudices against, or to be carried away with favorable
inclinations toward the one side more then the other. He is too little a
Judge, that is too much either a friend, or an enemy. Thirdly, whether he has
used all requisite diligence, patience, and wisdom in the examination of those
causes that have been brought before him, for the better finding out of the
truth; (as Job searched out the cause which he knew not:) without shuffling
over business in post-haste; Job 29.17.
not caring which way causes go, so he can but dispatch them out of the way
quickly, and Fourthly, whether he has indeed endeavored to his power to
repress or discountenance those that do ill offices in any kind, tending to
the perverting of justice: as namely, Those that lay traps for honest men, to
fetch them into trouble without desert; Those that sow discord among
neighbors, and stir up suites for petty trespasses and trifles of no value;
Those that abett by opening their mouths in their behalf in evil causes; Those
that devise new shifts to elude good Laws. Lastly, whether he has gone on
stoutly in a righteous way, to break the jaw-bones of the Lions in their
mouths, and to pluck the spoil from between their teeth, by delivering them
that were ready to be slain, or destinated to utter undoing by their powerful
oppressors: without fearing the faces of men, or fainting in the day of their
brothers adversity. He that has done all this in a good mediocrity, so far as
his understanding and power would serve, though he have not been able to remedy
all the evils, and to do all the good he desired; may yet Behold we knew it
not: and his excuse will be taken, in the judgment both of his own heart, and
of God who knows his heart; whatsoever other men think of him, or howsoever
they censure him. But if he have failed in all, or any the premises; though he
may blear the eyes of men with colorable pretenses, he cannot so secure his
own conscience: much less escape the judgment of God; before whose eyes
causeless excuses are of no avail. Which is the last of the three points
proposed: whereunto I now proceed.

30. The judgment of a man's own heart, is of great regard in then the censures
of all the men in the world besides. Better the world should condemn us, if our
own hearts acquit us; then that our hearts should condemn us, and all the world
acquit us. This is our rejoicing, the testimony of our conscience, says S.
Paul. The approbation of men may give some accessio^^ to the rejoicing, 2 Cor.
1.12.
(the other being first supposed:) but the main of it lies in the testimony of
the Conscience. This is the highest tribunal under heaven: but not absolutely
the highest; there is one in heaven above it. St. Paul, who thought it safe for
him to appeal hither, from the unjust censures of men: yet durst not think it
safe for him to rest here, but appealeth from it to a higher Court, and to the
judgment of Cor. 4. It was a very small thing with him to be judged of man's
judgment. 1 Cor. 4.3.
So long as he knew nothing by himself, so long as his own heart condemned him
not, -- 4.
he passed not much for the censures of men. Yet durst not justify himself
upon the acquital of his own heart. He knew there was much blindness and
deceitfulness in the heart of every sinful man: and it were no wisdom to trust
to that that might fail. He would up therefore to a higher and an unerring
Judge; that neither would deceive, nor could be deceived: and that was the
Lord. I judge not mine own self, says he, but he Even so here, Solomon
remitteth us over, for the trial of our pretended excuses, from our mouths to
our hearts; and from our hearts unto God. If thou say, Behold we knew it
not: does not he that pondereth the hearts consider it? etc. As if he had said,
No matter for thy words: look to thy heart. If thou pretendest one thing
without, and thy conscience tell thee another thing within: thou art (...),
cast and condemned by the sentence of thine own heart. But if thy heart
condemn thee not; the more indeed is thy comfort, and the stronger thy hope;
yet be not too confident upon it. There is an abyssus, a depth in thy heart
which thou can not fathom with all the line thou have. Thou have not a just
balance, wherein to weigh and to ponder thy own heart. That must be left
therefore wholly to the Lord, who alone can do it perfectly; and to whose
judgment alone every man shall finally stand or fall; and if he deserve to
fall, all his vain excuses shall not hold him up.

31. Which of how little avail they are in his sight, let us see in some few
examples. What gained Adam by his thin fig leaves, and thinner Apology. St
Bernard thinks, Genesis 3.24.
his later sin in excusing was in some respects rather greater then his first
sin in eating. I dare not say so: yet questionless that excuse of his added a
new guilt to the former, and aggravated his fault, to the farther provoking of
Gods displeasure. All he could do or say, could neither hide his nakedness, or
hold him in Paradise. Genesis 4.12.
And was not Cain condemned to be a perpetual runnagate, for all his excuse?
And Saul cast both out of Gods favor and the kingdom, for all his? 1 Samuel 15
26. Luke 14.24.
and unworthy guests, as they all made excuses together for company, so were
they all excluded from the great supper together for company. And the damned
reprobates at the last day shall not with all their allegations procure either
any stay of judgment before sentence be pronounced, Matthew. 25.46.
or the least mitigation thereof after.

32. If it were with Almighty God, as it is with Men: we might conceive some
hope, or possibility at least, that a mere pretended excuse might be of some
use to us. 1. Possibly, he might take it as it is, and never search farther
into it: 2. or he might search into the vanity and slightness of it: 3. or he
might find it out, and yet let it go unpunished. But the Text here assures
us, that it is quite otherwise with him, in each of these respects. 1. The Lord
will both search it out: for does not he that pondereth the heart, consider it?
and find it out: 2. for he that keeps thy soul, does not he know it? and
punish it: 3. for shall not he render to every man according to his works? Each
of which Interrogations does virtually contain a several reason of the point:
to let us see how impossible it is that causeless excuses should do us any good
before the judgment seat of God.

First, they will not avail us, because they cannot escape his search. Does not
he that pondereth the heart consider it? Men are credulous and inconsiderate
both ways: easily induced by a credible accusation, to condemn the innocent;
and as easily by a credible apology, to acquit an offender. But the righteous
Lord evermore takes the matter into his due consideration, and pondereth every
the Scriptures, fitted to our capacities, speak of him:) before he proceed to
give sentence. If the cry of the sins of Sodom be grievous, Genesis 18.21.
and call importunately upon him for vengeance: yet before he will pour it down
upon them in fire and brimstone, he will pause upon it (as it were) a little
first; he will go down and see, if their doings be altogether according to that
cry, Dan. 5.27, 28.
and if not, that he may know it. Neither will he give Belshazzars kingdom from
him to the Medes and Persians; before he have weighed him in the balance, and
found him too light. And as he will not take an accusation to the condemning,
so neither will he take an excuse to the acquitting of any person; without
sifting it well first, and searching into the truth of it. In which search he
is most exact and punctual. For he enters into the reins and kidneys, and
pierces even to the dividing asunder of the joints and marrow; Heb. 4.12.
and pryeth into the most secret in wards, and that with a most curious eye,
till he discern the most close and hidden thoughts and intents of the heart.
And to make sure work, that nothing may escape his search, by lurking unspied
in some remote corner or dark cranny of the heart: he takes Quantas^unque
tenebras factis tuis superstruxeris, Deus lumen est. Tertul. de poenit. c. 6.
a light with him; he Zeph. 1 12. Prove. 16.2.
searches it with candles, as the Prophet speaks. To omit those other
metaphorical, significant expressions, here and there scattered in the holy
Scriptures, to this purpose: this very phrase used in the Text of pondering the
heart, and that other like it in Prove. 16. of weighing the spirits, if there
were no other, would sufficiently show forth the exactness of his proceedings
in this trial. It is taken from the curiosity that men use in weighing gold, or
precious quintessences for medicine. It imports, that if in any thing we
pretend a scruple, or but so much as the least grain be wanting of the due
weight it should have: it will not pass current with him, but shall be turned
upon us again both to our shame and loss.

34. Secondly, vain excuses will not help us, because the vanity of them cannot
escape his knowledge. [He that keeps thy soul, does not he know it?] Men are
easily deluded with false shows, because they cannot always spy the falseness
and emptiness of them: as children are easily made believe that a piece of
brass is gold, when they see it glister. And the reason is evident, because men
have nothing to judge by but the outward appearance: 1 Samuel 16.17
and that can let them in but a very little way into the heart. So that what
the Preacher says Eccl. 8. in respect of other things, holds no less in
respect of the sincerity of men's hearts, and likewise of their speeches and
allegations; Eccl. 8.17.
Though a man labor to seek it out, yea, further though a wise man think to
know it, yet he shall not be able to find it. Only the Lord, in whose hands,
and before whose eyes our hearts and all our ways are, he that keeps our
souls, as it is here ( Servat, and observat too: (...)
the word may import either) he spieth out all observes all our haltings. We
deceive our selves, if we think to mock him, or to hide any thing out of his
sight. Psalm. 44.21.
Shall not God search it out? says David Psalm. 44. for he knows the very
secrets of the heart. Men may search for a thing, and be never the near;
because they cannot search it out: As Laban tumbled over all Jacobs stuff,
searching for his Idols, but found them not. Gen 31.34.
But where God searches, he does it effectually. Shall not God search it out?

35. Thirdly, vain excuses will not help us, because they cannot exempt us from
punishment and the just vengeance of God: for shall not he render to every man
according to his works? Men are sometimes swayed with partial affections, to
connive at such things as sorry excuse for a sufficient answer, when it is so
thin and transparent, that they cannot choose but see quite through it;
especially if it be tendered by such persons as they desire to show some respect
unto. But with the Lord, there is no respect of persons. He hates sin with a
perfect hatred; and punishes it, wheresoever he finds it: with severe
chastisements in his own dearest servants and children; but with fiery
vengeance and fury powered out upon his adversaries. Where he enjoyneth a duty,
he looks for obedience: and therefore where the duty is unperformed, the
disobedience is excuse it. Quid verba audiam, facta cum videam? It is the work
he looks at, in all his retributions: and where the work is not done, vain
words will not ward off the blows that are to be inflicted for the neglect; nor
any whit lessen them, either in their number or weight. Will they not rather
provoke the Lord in his just indignation to lay on both more and heavier
strokes? For where a duty is ill-neglected, and the neglect ill excused; the
offender deserves to be doubly punished: once for the omission of the duty,
and once more for the vanity of the excuse.

the love of God, and your own safety, to deal clearly and unpartially betwixt
God and your own souls in this affair, without shuffling or dawbing: and to
make straight paths to your feet; Heb. 12.13.
lest that which is lame be turned out of the way. Remember that they that
trust to lying vanities, Jon. 2.8.
(and false pretenses are no better) forsake their own mercy. And that fained
excuses are but as a staff of reed; a very weak stay for a heavy body to trust
to for support: which will not only crack under the weight; 2 King. 18.21
but the sharp splinters thereof will also run up into the hand, of him that
leans upon it. You see, the heart, that he pondereth: and the soul, that he
observes: and the work, that he recompenseth. Look therefore that your hearts
be true, and your souls upright, and your works perfect: that you may never
stand in need of such poor and beggarly shifts, as forged pretenses are; nor be
driven to fly for refuge to that which will nothing at all profit you in the
day of wrath desires be unfeighned, and your endeavors faithful, to the utmost
of your power to do Justice, and to show Mercy to your brethren; and to
discharge a good Conscience in the performance of all those duties that lie
upon you by virtue, either of your general calling as Christians, or of your
particular vocations, what ever they be, with all diligence and godly wisdom.
that you may be able to stand before the judgment seat of the great God with
comfort; and out of an humble and well-grounded confidence of his gracious
acceptance of your (imperfect, but sincere) desires and endeavors in Christ,
not fear to put your selves upon the trial; each of you in the words of holy
David Psalm. 139. Try me O Psalm. 139.
and seek the ground of my heart: prove me and examine my thoughts. Look well
if there be any way of wickedness in me; and lead me in the way everlasting; in
the way that leads to everlasting life. Which great mercy the Lord of his
infinite goodness vouchsafe unto us all, for his dear sons sake Jesus Christ
our blessed Savior. To whom etc.

1. A Bold and just challenge of an old Judge, made before all the people, upon
his resignal of the government into the hands of a new King. Samuel was the
man. Who, having continued (whilst Eli lived) in the service of the
Tabernacle, a Levite, and a private man; was (after his death) to undergo a
new business, 1 Samuel 7.6. and 19.
in the exercise of public judicature. For that fanatical opinion, which has
possessed some in these later times, that no Ecclesiastical person might
lawfully exercise any secular power, was in those days unheard of in the
world. Eli, though a Priest, was a Judge also; -- 4.18.
and so was Samuel, though a Levite, after him: And we find the people made
any question at all, or that themselves made any scruple at all, of the
lawfulness of those concurrent powers. Samuel was now (as it is collected by
those that have traveled in the Chronology,) aged about five and thirty years,
and so in his full strength, when he was first Judge: Which so long as it
continued in any measure, he little respected his own ease in comparison of the
common good; but took his 1 Samuel 7.16, 17.
yearly circuits about the country, keeping Courts in the most -- per loca ad
judicandum opportuna. Lyra.
convenient places abroad; besides his constant sittings at Ramah, where his
dwelling was, for the hearing and determining of Causes: to the great ease of
all, and

2. But by that he had spent about thirty years more in his countries service;
he could not but find such decays in his body, as would call upon him in his
now declining age to provide for some ease under that Aetate and curis
gravatus. Gloss. interl. (...). Joseph 6. Antiq. 3. 1 Samuel 8.1.
great burden of years and business. Which that he might so do, as that yet the
public service should not be neglected: he thought good to join his two sons
in commission with him. He therefore makes them Judges in Israel: in hope that
they would frame themselves by his example to judge the people with such like
diligence and uprightness as himself had done. But the -- 3.
as they had far other aims then the good old father had; so they took quite
(...). Joseph. ib. -- 4.
other ways then he did. Their care was not, to advance Justice, but to fill
their own coffers: which made them soon to turn aside after lucre, to take
bribes, and to pervert judgment. This fell out right for the elders of Israel:
who now had (by their miscarriage) a fair opportunity opened, to move at length
for that they had long thirsted after, viz. the change of the government. They
gather themselves therefore together, that the cry might be the fuller: and to
Ramah they come to Samuel, with many complaints and alledgements in their
mouths. But the short of the business was, -- 5.
a King they must have, and a King Samuel not a little, both to hear of the
mis-demeanour of his sons, of whom he had hoped better: and to see the
wilfulness of a discontented people, bent upon an Innovation. Yet he would
consult with God, before he would give them their answer. And then he answers
them: not by peremptorily denying them the thing they so much desired; but by
-- placide salubri oratione ab insana voluntate detorquet plebem. Sulpit. lib.
1.
seriously dissuading them from so inordinate a desire. But they persisting
obstinately in their first resolution: by farther direction from the Lord,
Samuel condescendeth to them dismisseth them, with a promise that it should be
done to them as they desired, and a King they should have ere it were long.

3. And within a while he made good his promise. The Lord had designed Saul to
be their King, and had secretly revealed the same to Samuel. Who did also by
Gods appointment first anoint very privately, no man being by, but they two
alone: and after in a full assembly of the people at Mispeh, evidenced him to
be the man whom God had chosen, by the determination of a lot. Whereupon the
most part of the people accepted Saul for their King elect: testifying their
acceptance by their joyful acclamations, and by sending him presents. Yet did
not Saul then immediately enter upon his full Regalities, (whether by reason of
some contradiction made to his election, or for whatsoever other cause,) but
that Samuel still continued in the government: 1 Samuel 11.1, etc.
till upon occasion of the Ammonites invading the land, and laying siege
against Iabesh-Gilead, Saul made such the Town and destroing the enemy, that no
man had the forehead to oppose against him any more. Samuel therefore took the
hint of that victory to establish Saul completely in the kingdom, by calling
the people to Gilgal where the Tabernacle then was: where he once more anointed
Saul before the Lord, -- 24, etc.
and in a full congregation; investing him into the kingdom with great
solemnity, sacrifices of peace offerings, and all manner of rejoycings.

4. Now had the people, according to their desire, a King: and now was Samuel,
who had long governed in chief, again become a private man. Yet was he still
the Lords Prophet: and by virtue of that calling took himself bound to make the
people sensible of the greatness to ask a King, before they had first asked to
know the Lords pleasure therein. And this is in a manner the business of this
whole Chapter. Yet before he begin to fall upon them, he does wisely first; to
clear himself: and for the purpose he challenges all and every of them, if
they could accuse him of any injustice, or corruption in the whole time of his
government, then and there to speak it out, and they should receive
satisfaction, or else for ever after to hold their tongues: in the three first
verses of this Chapter, but especially in this third verse [ Behold, here I am:
witness

5. In which words are observable both the Matter and Form of Samuels
challenge. The Matter of it, (to wit, the thing whereof he would clear
himself,) is set down, first in general terms: that he had not wrongfully
taken to himself that which was another, [ Whose Ox have I taken? or whose
Ass have I taken?] And then more particularly, by a perfect enumeration of the
several species or kinds thereof: which being but three in all, are all
expressed in this challenge. All wrongful taking of any thing from another man,
is done either with or without the parties consent. If without the parties
consent: then either by cunning or violence; fraud, or oppression;
overreaching wit, or over-bearing him by might. If with the parties consent;
then it is by contracting with him for some fee, reward, or gratification.
Samuel here disclaimeth them all, [ Whom have I defrauded? whom have I
oppressed? or of whose hand have I received a bribe, to blind my eyes
therewith? That is the matter of the challenge.

6. In the form, we may observe concerning Samuel 3. other First, his great
forwardness in the business, in putting himself upon the trial by his own
voluntary offer, before he was called thereunto by others. [ Behold, here I
am.] Secondly, his great Confidence, upon the conscience of his own integrity;
in that he durst put himself upon his trial before God and the world [ witness
against me before the Lord, and before his Anointed.] Thirdly, his great
Equity, in offering to make real satisfaction to the full, in case any thing
should be justly proved against him in any of the premises [ whose ox, or
whose ass, etc? and I will restore it you.]

7. The particulars are many: and I may not take time to give this assembly,
then upon some of the rest; yet not much upon any. Neither do I mean in the
handling thereof to tie my self precisely to the method of my former division:
but following the course of the Text, to take the words in the same order, as I
find them there laid to my hand. Behold, here I am, witness against me etc.

8. Behold, here I am. More have then needs, may some say: It savoureth not
well, that Samuel is so forward to justify accuse him. Voluntary purgations
commonly carry with them strong suspicions of guilt. We presume there is a
fault, when a man sweateth to put off a crime, before it be laid to his charge.
True: and well we may presume it, where there appears not some reasonable
cause otherwise for so doing. But there occur sundry reasons, some apparent,
and the rest at least probable, why Samuel should here do as he did.

9. First, he was presently to convince the people of their great sin, in
asking a King, and to chastise them for it with a severe reprehension. It might
therefore seem to him expedient, before he charge them with innovating the
government, to discharge himself first from having abused it. He that is either
to Omni^ qua vindicaris in alt^r^, tibi ipsi vehementer fugienda sunt. Cic. in
Ver. 3.
rebuke or to punish others for their faults, had need stand clear both in his
own conscience, and in the eye of the world, of those faults he should censure,
and of all other crimes as foul as they: lest he be choked with that bitter
proverb, retorted upon him to his great reproach. Luke ^.23. (...). Jamb. apud
Plut. de dignose* adul.
Physician heal thy self. Juven. sat. 2.
Vitia ultima fictos Contemnunt Scauros, and castigata remordent. How Nihil est
quod minus ferendum sit, quam rationem ab altero vitae exposcere cum, qui non
possit sua reddere. Cic. divin. in Qu. Cacil.
unequal a thing is it, and incongruous, that he who wants no ill conditions
himself, should bind his neighbor to the good behavior? That a Homicidae
tyrannus irasciturand and punit furt^ sacrilegus. Senec. 2. de ira. 28. Luke
6.42.
sacrilegious Church-robber should make a mittimus for a poor sheep-stealer? Or
(as he complained of old) that great thieves should hang up little ones? How
can thou say to thy brother, Brother let me pull out the mote that is in thine
eye, when behold there is a beam in thine own eye? That conscience, nay, with
what face can thou offer it? Turpe est doctori, every schoolboy can tell
you. See to it all you, who by the condition of your callings are bound to take
notice of the actions and demeanours of others, and to censure them; that you
Sic agitur (...) sic exe^p^a parantur: Cum jadex alios quod monet, ipse facit.
Ovid 6. fastor.
walk orderly and unreprovably your selves. It is only the sincerity and
unblameableness of your conversations, that will best add weight to your
words, winn awe and esteem to your persons, preserve the authority of your
places, put life into your spirits, and enable you to do the works of your
callings with courage and freedom.

Secondly, Samuel here justifies himself for their greater conviction, and for
the more aggravating of their sin. If his government had been tyrannous, or
corrupt; it had been somewhat the more excusable in them to have attempted a
change, (though I cannot say, that the greatest tyranny or corruption in a
Governor imaginable, could have warranted such an attempt in toto:) Yet
whatsoever fault there had been in them for so doing; had he been liable to any
just exceptions in that kind, he must have born his share also of the blame,
as well as they: they, for that their seditious attempt; and he, for giving
them the occasion. Whereas his innocence puts off all the blame from him,
and leaves it wholly upon them: who now can no more excuse themselves, then
they can accuse him. They had rejected him with a nolumus hunc regnare: rather
they had rejected (...). Joseph. 1 Samuel 8.7.
God in him [ They have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I
should not reign over them, Chap. 8.] It stood him therefore upon, to clear
himself from all sinister surmises and suspicions of injustice: that it might
appear to them and to all the world, that he had given them no cause why they
should so reject him; and that therefore they must thank themselves for it, and
not him, if in any aftertimes they should have cause to repent it. It is a
brave thing for a Magistrate, or indeed for any (...). Gal. 2.14.
an even foot, and in an upright course: that when bad people shall go about
to disparage him, or to speak or but think unworthily of him, he may be able to
contest with them, for the maintenance of his innocence, and to stand upon his
own justification. As St. Paul did; I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, Act
20.33.
or apparel: And as Moses did; I have not taken an ass from them, neither have
I hurt one of them: Number. 16.33.
And as our blessed Savior himself did; I have done many good works among you,
Joh. 10.32.
for which of those works do you stone me? And as Samuel here does; Behold here
I am: witness against me, Whose ox etc.

Thirdly, Samuel had now surrendered the administration into the hands of the
new King: and so having given up his office, he thought it meet to render an
account how he had carried himself therein. It goes sore with an evil steward,
Vl^^ o me sist^, ut administratae a me Reip. rationem reddam Jun. annot.
to hear of a reckoning: whereas he that has been faithful, desires nothing
more. Whatsoever our callings are; we are but stewards over some part Luke 16.3.
and it were good for us eft-soons to remember, 2 Cor. 5.10.
that our Master will require of us an account of our stewardships. The time
will come, when we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, to give
in our accounts: And we must look to have them examined most strictly, even ad
ultimum quadrantem, to the very utmost Farthing. Mat. 12.36. Wisd. 1.9.
Not an idle word, nor a vain thought, but must then be -- ut ne minimae quidem
cogitationes, ac verba minutissima, eju^ judicio indiscussa remaneant. Gregor.
Rev. 6.16. Genesis 3, 8, 9.
accounted for. They that judge others now, shall then be rejudged: and all
their proceedings re-examined and reviewd with a most curious, unerring, and
unpartial eye. O happy, thrice happy that servant, who conscious to his own
faithfulness, the hills and rocks to hide him from the face of the great Judge,
or to run to the thickets as Adam did, till he be fetched out with that terrible
process (Adam where art thou?) but shall readily present himself with much
assurance and comfort before him, as Samuel here did before the King and the
people, and say, Behold here I am.

12. And why might not Samuel do this fourthly even in wisdom, for the timely
preventing of future cavil and dangers. There were some pretensions against his
sons, of Injustice and Corruption: and if matters should come to public
scanning, like enough much the Fathers prejudice in aftertimes, who could
tell? Little reason had he howsoever to trust a giddy people; (so unthankful,
and so newfangled, as he had found them to be) and to suffer either his safety
or credit to lie at their courtesy. So long as these things should hang upon
the file, or lie in the deck; he might perhaps be safe, but he could not be
secure. That therefore the miscarriages of others might not fall on his neck,
he might think it safest for him to get his Quietus est betimes. And therefore
he requires them all, if any man had ought to object against him, that they
would now produce it in open Court: if they had not; acquit him by their
general suffrages. By which means having obtained a public testimony from
them, as we see in the verses fol^owing, and so being (as it were) quit by
Proclamation; he is thenceforth safe against all evil calumniations, and
fearless of after-claps. It is a base and unmanly thing, to use indirect and
underhand dealing to shift off a just trial: but a point of honest and
Christian wisdom, in a fair and open way handsomely to prevent an unjust
accusation. No fault for a man to use the Serpents wisdom, so it be not tainted
with the Serpents poison Mat. 10.16.
but rightly tempered with a due mixture of Dove-like simplicity and innocence.

13. Lastly, to dissuade the people formerly from asking a King, Samuel had
told them what a King might do Ius Regis. 1 Samuel 8.11.
De Iure, if he should use his absolute power: and what if a King should do De
Facto, submit, they might not at any hand resist. And he knew, that by their
obstinacy in asking a King, they had so highly displeased the Lord, that it
were but just with him, if he should suffer their new King to rule over them
with rigor and tyranny. It might very well be, that out of this very
consideration Samuel was the rather induced at this time to declare his own
integrity; that so he might propose unto the new King now in the entrance of
his reign a pattern of equity and justice in his own example. Even as S. Paul
oftentimes proposes his own example to the Churches for their imitation. (I
beseech you brethren to be followers of me. 1 Cor. 4.16. Phil. 4.9.
Those things which you have heard and seen in me, do, etc.) We see the -- nec
ad rationem, sed ad similitudinem vivimus. Senec. de vit. beat. cap. 1.
example. What ever the attempt be; usually one of the first enquiries is: Not
whether there be any Law, or any Reason, or any Conscience; but whether there
be any Precedent for it, yea or no. And if any such be to be found, it seldom
sticks. It helps out many an ill matter; it gives a fair color to many
foul proceedings: when men have this yet to plead for themselves, that they do
but as others have done before them, and continue things as they found them.
Terent. in Eunuch.
Hoc olim factitavit Pyrrhus, seemed to him plea enough in the Comedy. It so
good and wise man, especially those that are in place of authority (whose
actions are most looked upon, and soonest drawn into example,) so to order
themselves in their whole conversations, that such as come after them may be
rather provoked by their good example to do well, then encouraged by their evil
example to do amiss. If at any time hereafter Saul should take any man's Ox or
Ass from him by any manner fraud, oppression, or bribery: the constant
practice of his immediate predecessor for sundry years together shall stand
up, and give evidence against him, and cast him. Samuels integrity shall
condemn him, both at the bar of his own conscience, and in the mouths of all
Samuel for his precedent; no color to shroud his miscarriages under the
authority of Samuels example.

14. We cannot now marvel, that Samuel should thus offer himself to the trial,
when as no man urged him to it: since there may be rendered so many congruous
reasons for it. Especially being withal so conscious to himself, of having
dealt uprightly, that he knew all the world could not touch him with any wilful
violation of justice. He does not therefore decline the trial, but confidence:
challenging all comers, and craving no favor [ Behold, here I am: witness
against me before the Lord, and before his anointed.] Here is no excepting
against any witness: nor refusal of any Judge, either God or Man. He had a good
cause: and therefore he had also a good heart. All virtues are connext: among
the rest, so are Justice, (...) 28.1.
and Fortitude. The righteous are bold as a Lion. The Merchant the dark shop,
and false light: whereas he that will uphold them right and good, wills his
customers to view them in the open sun. Joh. 3.20, 21.
Qui male agit, odit lucem. He that does evil, loves to skulke in the dark,
and will not abide the light, (which is to him as the terrors of the shadow of
death) lest his evil deeds should be found out and laid open to his shame. Job
24.17.
Even as Adam hid his head in a bush, when he heard the voice of God, because
his conscience told him he had transgressed.

15. A corrupt Magistrate or Officer may sometimes set a face bid defiance to
all the world: but it is then, when he is sure he has power on his side to
bear him out; when he is so backed with his great friends that no man dare
mutire contra, once open his lips against him for fear of being shent. Even as
a rank Coward may take up the bucklers, and brave it like a stout Champion;
when he is sure the coast is clear, and no body near to enter the lists with
him. And yet all this but a mere flourish; a faint and feigned bravada: his
heart the while in the midst of his belly is as cold as lead; and he means
nothing less, then what he makes show of. If the offer should be indeed
accepted, the public stage, there to receive a due and unpartial hearing and
doom: how would he then Nes^i^ tu quam meticulosares sit ire ad judicium.
Plaut. in Mostell. 5.1.
shrink and hold off, trow ye? then what crowching, and fawning, and bribing,
and dawbing, to have the matter taken up in a private chamber; and the wound of
his credit a little overly salved, though upon never so hard and base
conditions? His best wits shall be tried, and his best friends to the utmost,
if it be possible by any means to decline a public trial.

16. Be just then, Fathers and Brethren; and ye may be bold. So long as you
stand right, you stand upon your own legs, and not defrauding, oppressing, or
receiving rewards; and you make your selves slaves for ever. Intus pugnae,
soris timores: Horrors and gripes within, because you have knowingly done what
you ought not: Terrors and fears without, lest your wicked dealings should
come to light, whereby you might receive the due shame or punishment thereof.
Possibly you may bear up, if the times favor you, and by your greatness
outface your crimes for a while: But that is not a thing to trust to, [ O
trust not in wrong and robbery, says David Psalm. 62.] The wind and the tide
may turn against you, Psalm. 62.10.
when you little think -- Sejanus ducitur unco Speclandus: gaudent omnes.
Juven. Sat. 10.
go down the wind, every base and busy companion will have one puff at you,
to drive you the faster and the farther down.

17. Yet mistake not, as if I did exact from Magistrates an absolute immunity
from those common frailties and infi^mities, your calling and ours (Magistracy
and Ministry,) that every ignorant Artisan, that perhaps knows little and
practices less of his own duty, can yet instruct us in ours; and upon every
small oversight make grievous outcries, by objecting to you your place, to us
our cloth (A man of his place, a man of his Cloth, to do thus or thus!) As if
any Christian man, of what place, or of what cloth soever, had the liberty to
do otherwise then well: or as if either we or you were in truth that in respect
of our natures, which in respect of our offices we are sometimes called: we
Angels, and you Gods. Rev. 1.20. Psalm. 82 6.
Truly how ever style us: yet we find it in our selves (but too well) and we
make it seem by us (alas, but too often) that we are men; (...), Act. 14.15.
subject to the like passions, ignorances, and sinful aberrations that other
men are. And I doubt not but Samuel, notwithstanding all this great confidence
in his own integrity, had yet among so many causes, as in so many years space
had gone through his hands, sundry times erred in judgment: either in the
substance of the sentence, or at least in some circumstances of the
proceedings. By mis-informations, or mis-apprehensions, or by other passions or
prejudices, no doubt but he le^ity, or more rigor, then was in every respect
expedient.

18. But this is the thing, that made him stand so clear, both in his own
conscience, and in the sight of God and the world; that he had not wittingly
and purposely perverted judgment, nor done wrong to any man with an evil or
corrupt intention: but had used all faithfulness and good Conscience in those
things he did rightly apprehend; and all requisite care and diligence (so far
as humane frailty would suffer) to find out the truth and the right in those
St. Paul) to have always a conscience void of offense toward God, and toward
men: Act. 24.16.
and then you may (with him also) be bold to call both God and men to bear
witness to your Integrity. ( Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily, and
justly, 1 Thessalonians. 2.10.
and unblameably we behaved our selves among you, 1 Thessalonians. 2.) and with good
Samuel here to put your selves for the trial of your uprightness upon your God,
King, and Country, [ Behold, here I am: witness against me before the Lord, and
before his Anointed.

19. Thus much of Samuels confidence. See we next, what the the matter of the
Challenge. It is in the general, Injury or Wrong: the particular kinds whereof
in the Text specified, are Fraud, Oppression, and Bribery. Against all and
every of these he expressly protests: Whose Ox have I taken? or whose ass
have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand
have To begin with the General; Whose Ox have I taken, or whose Ass have I
taken? These two creatures, the Ox and the Ass are here mentioned, because of
their great usefulness: the strength of the Ox, and the patience of the Ass,
enabling them; the one for labor, the other for carriage. For in those times
and countries they used Asses altogether for journeys and for burdens; as we
now adays and in these parts of the world do Horses: See Deuteronomy. 17.16; Psalm.
20.7; Prove. 21.31; See Genesis 32.5; Exodus 23.4.12; Job 13; Luke 13.15; Exodus 20.17.
Whereof in old time we find very little speech of any other use, then for the
services of war only. Whence it is, that the Ox and the Ass are in the
Scriptures so frequently mentioned together, and so reckoned together as a
principal part of a man's wealth: and also both here and elsewhere by way of
Synecdoche put for a man's whole substance or estate. In the last Commandment
of the Ten, after those words Thou shall not covet thy neighbors Ox nor his
Ass, it is added, nor any thing that is thy neighbors. What is there
expressed, the same is here to be understood: as if Samuel had said; I have
neither taken any man's Ox nor Ass, nor any thing else that was another man's.

20. And then by Taking he must needs mean (...). Diphil. apud Stobae. Ser. 8.
wrongful taking: the words will else bear no reasonable construction. For
commerce and civil contracts, such as are buying, selling, giving, exchanging,
and the like, wherein the right and property of things is transferred from one
man to another by delivering and taking ((...):) what were it else, but to
overthrow all humane society, and utterly to destroy all the offices of
Commutative Justice; which is wholly conversant about contracts of that nature.
His meaning clearly is, that contenting himself with his own portion, he had
not sought to enrich himself by the spoil of others; or to gain any thing to
himself to his neighbors hurt by any unjust or unconscionable means. It is the
first and principal office of Justice, suum cuique, to let every man have his
And the holy law of God binds our very thoughts and desires from coveting,
(but how much more then our hands from taking?) that which of right belongs
not to us. Exodus 20.17.
That (...) therefore in the Law, Thou shall not covet that which is another;
is by our Savior himself, the best interpreter of the Law, rendered by (...) in
the Gospel, Thou shall not take that which is another. To teach us, that whosoever
will allow himself the liberty to desire it, will not deny himself the liberty
(if opportunity serve) to take it: And that therefore whosoever would hold his
hands, must covetous lusts.

21. It is verily nothing so much as our Inde se^e scelerum causae: nec plura
-- etc. Juvenal. Sat. 14. 1 Timothy 6.10.
Covetousness, that makes us unjust: which S. Paul affirms to be the root of
all evil; but is most manifestly the root of this evil of injustice. Aristotle
shows it out of the native signification of the Greek word (...) a desire of
having more; more then is our due, more then falls to our part or share. As
if a man that were to divide something betwixt himself and his fellow by even
portions, should share the biggest part to himself, whereby to make himself a
gainer, and his partner a loser. This is (...): and it is indeed quite contrary
to that (...) as S. James calls it, that Royal Law, Thou shall love thy
neighbor as thy self; and to that great fundamental Rule of Equity, James 2.8.
by which as by the Standard we ought to mete out all our dealings toward our
brethren, Quod tibi fieri non vis, etc. Whatsoever Mat. 7.12.
do you even the same to them.

22. If all men would first look back into the most suspected passages of their
former dealings, unpartially trying them but by this one Rule (and by this one
Rule they shall all be tried at the last day;) and then would secondly resolve
to lay this Rule ever before their eyes, for the levelling of their future
conversations: what a world of injustice might they find out by the one, keep
out by the other? which, because that Rule is so much neglected, are therefore
now so little regarded. Say, thou that by thy cunning over-reachest thy brother
in buying, selling, or bargaining; the trust reposed in thee by thy friend:
could thou brook, to be in like sort cheated thy self? Thou that Ahab-like
wringest thy poor neighbors Vineyard from him; drivest him by continual
molestations to this strait, that either he must forsake the town (if thou have
a mind to enclose it) or else consent to his own and most of his neighbors
undoing; or any other way enforcest him to come to thy bent for fear of a worse
displeasure: could thou think it reasonable, if his case were thine, to be
so plagued and oppressed thy self? Thou that bribest a corrupt Officer,
subornest a perjured witness, procurest a and (where thou can conceive any
hope that it will be taken,) offerest to conveigh a reward into the bosom even
of the Judge himself; to pervert judgment, and to get the day of thine
adversary, when his cause is more righteous then thine: could thou be
patient thy self to be wrested out of thine own apparent right by such engines?
In a word, thou that take thy brothers Ox, or his Ass, or any thing that is
his, from him wrongfully: would thou be content thy brother should
wrongfully take thine? Whosoever thou art that do another wrong, do but
(...). Isocrat. in Nicoc.
turn the tables; imagine thy neighbor were now playing thy game, and thou
his:

23. But men that are resolved of their End, (if this be their End, to make
themselves great and rich -- quo cunque modo rem. Horat. 1. epist. 1.
howsoever,) are not much moved with arguments of this nature. The evidence of
Gods Law, and conscience of their own duty, work little upon them: Gain is the
thing they look after; as for Equity, they little regard it. Let me tell them,
then that unjust gain is not gain, but loss. Nor is this a paradoxe: when a
mere heathen man could say, Hesiod (...).
(...): and another, Lucrum p^ta lucrum, si justum siet. St. Paul places gain
in godliness, 1 Timothy 6.6. Mark. 8.36.
not in wealth: and our Savior teaches, that he that should gain the whole
world, if he should for that lose his own soul, should have little cause to
boast of his peniworth. Lucrum in arca, damnum in conscienti^: the gain will no
ways countervail the loss. All this is most certain truth: but still we hit
not upon the right string. Psalm. 17.4.
The worldling has his portion in this present life; and in these outward
things; and therefore what losses befall him therein, he can feel as soon as
another man, and value them as well: But he is not much sensible either of a
spiritual, or an eternal loss. To come home to him then; let him know that the
gain of unrighteousness shall not long prosper with him and his. Treasures of
wickedness profit little, Prove. 10.2.
says Solomon Prove. 10. His meaning is, take them a primo ad ultimum, and they
profit nothing. A man may seem to profit by them, and to come up wonderfully
for a time; but time and experience show, that they milder away again at the
last, and crumble to nothing; and that for the most part within the compass of
an age. Seldom shall you see them Prove. 20.21.
but very rarely beyond, the next generation. An inheritance may be gotten
hastily at the beginning: but the end thereof shall not be blessed; the same
Solomon Prove. 20. The morsels of deceit (and violence) that were so pleasant in
the chewing; -- 17. Job 20.15.
the time will come when they shall be vomited up again with sorrow and
bitterness. 3 King. 21* 19.
What gained Ahab by it, when he had made himself master of Nahoths vineyard,
but the hastening of his own destruction? And what was Gehazi the better for
the gifts he received from Naaman; 4 King. 5.27.
which brought an hereditary leprosy with them? And what was Achan the richer
for the golden wedge he had saved out of the Jos. 7.24.
and hidden in his tent; which brought destruction upon him, and all that
appertained to him?

24. Brethren, let us be wise and wary, and not deceive our selves. These
gobbets are but Satan's baits: which when we swallow, we swallow a hocke with
them, wherewith he will strike us through at the last, though he suffer us a
while to play upon the line, and to please ourselves with those new morsels.
Let us therefore beware that we suffer not the least portion of unjust gain to
cleave to our fingers, Deuteronomy. 13.17. Ios. 7.11.
or to mingle with our other substance. There is a secret poison in it, which
in time will diffuse it self through the mercury-water or Aqua fortis, eat out
all: as some write of the Ostriches feather, that it will in time moult and
consume all the feathers in the tub wherein it is put. Mat. 13 33; and 1 Cor.
5.6.
Know you not, that a small handful of leaven, if it meal, will work it self
into every part of it, sour the whole lump? And that a single rood of
Capite-land will bring the whole estate into wardship, though containing many
thousand acres of never so free a tenure? It was wisely done therefore of
Samuel, as well as justly, not to meddle with the taking of any man's Ox or
Ass.

25. It ought to be the care of every private man, thus far to follow Samuels
example, that he keep himself from doing any man wrong. But men that are in
place of government, as Samuel was, have yet a farther charge lying upon them
over and besides the former: and that is to preserve others from wrong; and
being wronged, to relieve them to the utmost of their power. A Magistrate
should be so far from taking any man's ox or ass from him; that, so far as he
can hinder it, he should not suffer any other man so to do. Where Commutative
Justice is by private persons violated, through fraud, oppression, or bribery:
there it behooves the Magistrate to set in, and do his part in the
administration of Distributive Justice: for the rectifying and redressing
thereof. It is the very end, for which principally Laws, and Courts, and
Magistrates were ordained.

so sacred an ordinance, for the abetting, countenancing, or strengthening of
any injurious act. They that have skill in the Laws; by giving dangerous Bonus
vir non agit nisi bonas causas. Quintil. 12. instit. 1.
counsel in the chamber, or pleading smoothly at the Bar. They that attend
about the Courts; by keeping back just complaints, or doing other cast of their
office in favor of an evil person or cause. But especially the Magistrates
themselves; by a perfunctory or partial hearin^, by pressing the Laws with
rigor, or qualifying them with some mitigation, where they ought not. Where
others do wrong; if they know it and can help it; connivence makes them
Accessories: and then the greatness and eminency of their places enhanseth the
crime yet further, and makes them Principals. Qui non prohibet peccare, cum
potest, jubet. He that suffers another to take any man's ox or ass from him;
or his house, or land, or common from him; or his tith or glebe from him; or
his liberty or good name from him; or his life or any part of his livelihood
from him; being able to remedy it: it is all one as if he should bid him do
it. -- Me nemo ministro Fur erit, is a fit Motto for every good Magistrate.

27. I have now done with the Genus, the Species follow; Fraud, Oppression, and
Bribery. [Whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I
received a bribe, to blind mine eyes therewith?] Most Injuries are reduced to
the two first heads; Cic. 1. de offic. (...). Homer.
Fraus and Vis. Sometimes a man is wronged, and perceives it not till
afterward; which, if he had known in time, he might have prevented: this is
Defrauding. Sometimes he sees wronged; but knows not which way in the world
to avoid it: this is Oppression. There he met with a Fox: here with a Lion. In
that he is over-wrought by Craft: in this overborn by Might. Both are joined
together in the Psalm [ He shall redeem their soul from falsehood and violence,
Psalm. 72.14. Zeph. 1.9.
Psalm 72.] And in the Prophet [ I will punish those that leap on the
threshold, which fill their masters houses with violence and deceit, Zeph. 1.]
And they are sometimes joined together in practice. As Pharaoh said consulting
the destruction of the Israelites, Exodus 1.10.
Opprimamus sapienter, let us deal wisely with them, and destroy them. And as
Lysander (...). Plut. in Lysandr.
the Lions skin would not reach to do the business, it should be eaked out with
the Foxes. Both are hateful both to God and man: Cic. lib. 1. de Offic.
Sed fraus odio digna majore, says the Orator; of the two, Deceit is the
baser and more hateful. Because men had rather be thought to want strength,
(for that begets pity;) then to want wit (which does but expose them to
scorn:) thence it is, that usually they complain more of treachery, then they
do of open hostility; and take it deeper to heart to be defrauded, then to be
oppressed. The loss troubles them not so much, they say: but they cannot
endure to be couzened. Samuel, you see, Whom have I defrauded?

28. He knew the Law of God, and the Law of Equity, (the written, and the
unwritten Law both) were altogether against it. Thou shall not defraud thy
neighbor, Levit. 19.13.
Levit. 19. and after in the same Chapter, -- 35.
Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in mete-yard, in weight, or in
measure. In the sixth Chapter of the same book, it is declared that he that
commits a trespass by deceiving his neighbor sins therein: Lev. 6.2. etc.
and the Law there enjoyneth an offering to be made for the expiating of that
sin. How often does Solomon condemn false weights and false balances as foul
abominations? And how frequently the Prophets object it, Prove. 11.1.20.10.23.
Jer. 5.26.27. Osee. 12.7.
as a main provocation of Gods heavy judgments upon the Land, That they set
traps, and laid snares for men; That their houses were full of deceit, as a
cage is full of birds; That they were as crafty Merchants, in whose hands are
the balances of deceit; That they made the Ephah (whereby they measured out
the commodities they sold) small, Amos. 8.5.
and the Shekel (wherewith they weighed the money they were to receive for that
they sold) great, and falsified the balances; and the like? S. Paul also (if
the translations speak his sense aright) lays a charge upon the
Thessalonians, That no man go beyond or defraud his brother in any matter: Both
the will of God sufficiently revealed in his Word, that men should not do so;
and because God will be a sure and severe avenger of those that do so, 1 Thessalonians.
4. And he chideth the Corinthians for doing wrong, 1 These. 4.3 -- 6 1 Cor. 6.8.
and defrauding one another, 1 Cor. 6. And lest in what he either forbids
to, or reproves in others, himself Receive us, we have wronged no man, 2 Cor.
7.2.
we have defrauded no man, 2 Cor. 7. And again 2 Cor. 12. Be it, I did not
burden you, (as the false Apostles for filthy lucre, and to serve their own
bellies, -- 12.17.
did,) nevertheless it may be you will think I was crafty, Romans 16.18.
and caught you with guile. No such matter, says he, I abhor it; I never made
gain of you, either by my self, or by my Agents, Titus or any other that I sent
unto you. Much like Samuels challenge here, Whom have I defrauded?

29. A very grievous thing it is to think of, but a thing merely impossible to
reckon up, (how much less then to remedy and reform?) frauds and deceits that
are used in the world. Wherein men are grown wondrous expert: and so shameless
withal; that they think it rather a credit to them, as an argument of their
perfect understanding in their several mysteries and particular professions,
then any blemish to them in their Christian profession, to cheat and cozen,
they care not whom, nor how; so they may get Persidiam, frauds, and ab omni
crimine lucrum Quaesitum. Juvenal. Sat. 13. Prove. 20.14.
gain, and gather wealth by it. In the way of trade, in buying, selling, and
other bargaining; what lying, dissembling, and deceiving? It is stark naught,
says the buyer; it is perfect good, says the seller: when many times neither
of both speaks, weights, false measures, false thumbs, false lights, false
marks, false wares, false oaths: in the Markets and Shops. In the common
offices of neighborhood, friendship, service, or trust: false gloses, false
promises, false tales, false cracks, false shows, false reckonings. In the
Courts of Law and all juridical proceedings: false Bills, false answers, false
suggestions, false counsels, false accusations, false pleas, false testimonies,
false records, false motions, false verdicts, false judgments. The hour would
fail me to mention but the chief heads of those falsehoods, that are common and
notorious: falsehoods, that are daily invented and exercised every where under
the Sun.

30. Yet are they all in the mean time, abominable to God that beholds them (
The Lord will abhor both the blood-thirsty and deceitful man:) and will prove
in the end unprofitable to those that use them, Psalm 5.6*
and (without repentance) damnable. He that beguileth another, however he may
please himself therewithal onward; yet shall find at length that he has most
of all beguiled himself: 2 Timothy 3.13.
deceiving as the Apostles words (though spoken to another purpose) are,
According to that of Solomon, The wicked works a deceitful work; Prove. 11.18.
but to him that sows righteousness shall be a sure reward. Blessed is the
man then, in whose heart and tongue, and hands there is found no deceit; That
walks uprightly, and works righteousness, Psalm. 15.2. etc.
and speaks the truth from his heart; That has his wits to hurt his
neighbor; nor made advantage of any man's unskilfulness, simplicity, or
credulity to gain from him wrongfully; That can stand upon it, as Samuel here
does, and his heart not give his tongue the lie, that he has defrauded no man.

31. The other kind of Injury, here next mentioned, is Oppression: wherein a
man makes use of his power to the doing of wrong, as he did of his wits in
defrauding. Which is for the most part the fault of rich and great men: because
they have the greatest power so to do, and are not so easily resisted in what
they will have done. Jam. 2.6.
Do not not the rich men oppress you, Jam. 2. For riches lift up the hearts of
men, and swell them with pride ( Charge them that are rich in this world, 1 Timothy 6.17.
that they be not high-minded, says S. Paul:) and pride brings on Oppression
( let not the proud oppress me, Psalm. 119.122.
says David, Psalm. 119.) They are the large fat kine of Basan, (that is, the
Princes, and Nobles, and great ones of the land, Amos 4.1.
) those that dwell in the mountains of Samaria, that oppress the poor, and
crush the needy. Amos 4. Yet not they only: for even poor and mean men also are
in their dispositions as proud, and as merciless, as the greatest; if their
powers were answerable to their wills, and their horns to their curstness: and
they power will serve them so to do. Now this also Samuel disclaimeth as well
as the former. Although he had a large power, having been chief governor for
many years together, and so (...).
not bound to render an account of his actions to any: yet he doubts not but
to acquit himself before the whole congregation from having any ways in all
that so long a time abused his so vast power unto oppression. [ Whom have I
oppressed?]

32. He well knew, that Oppression, though it were a common, yet was withal a
grievous and a base sin. A very common sin it is. Elihu speaks of multitudes
of Oppressions, Job. 35.8* Amos 8.4.
Job. 35. How do the swallow up the needy: as in the forests As the wild ass
is the lions prey in the wilderness: so the rich eat up the poor. Sirac. 13.19.
the greater beasts prey upon the lesser; and in the ponds (...). Basil. in
Hexam. hom. 7. Esaias 3.15. Psalm. 14.4. Levit. 25.14.
the larger fishes eat up the smaller fry? Grinding the faces of the poor
first, and then eating them up like bread: racking their rents, taking in their
commons, overthrowing their tenures, diminishing their wages, increasing their
boones. In a word, (for it would be endless to run through particulars) taking
advantage of their inability to help themselves, or other their necessities in
any kind whatsoever, to work their own wills upon them, and to get somewhat
from them

33. Yet is it indeed a very grievous sin, forbidden by God himself in express
terms Levit. 25. If thou sell ought unto thy neighbor, or buyest ought of thy
neighbors hand, ye shall not oppress one another: -- 17.
and so going on concludes, Ye shall not therefore oppress one Implying that
it is from want of the fear of God, that men oppress one another. Solomon
therefore says, that he that oppresses the poor, Prove. 14.31.
reproacheth (or despises) his maker. Prove. 14. And indeed so he does, more
ways then one. First, he despises his Makers Commandment, who has (as you
heard) peremptorily forbidden him to oppress. Secondly, he despises his Makers
Creature: the poor man whom he so oppresses being Gods workmanship as well as
himself. Thirdly, he despises his Makers Example: who looks upon the
distresses of the poor and oppressed, to provide for them, and to relieve them.
Fourthly, he despises his Makers Ordinance: in perverting that power and
wealth, which God lent him purposely to do good therewithal, and turning it to
a quite contrary use, to the hurt and damage of others. And he that goes on to
reproach his Maker, (without repentance) must needs do it to his own
confusion. He that made him, can mar him when he pleases: and the greatest
oppressors shall be no more able to stand before him then, than their poorer
brethren are now able to stand out against them.

34. Add to the grievousness of this sin, the baseness of it also: and that
methinks should work much upon every noble and generous poor worms of the
earth, who when they are trodden on, dare scarce so much as turn again: ( for
as much as your treading is upon the poor, Amos 5.11.
Amos 5.) and it is a poor and inglorious conquest, that is gotten by the foil
of such an adversary. Rob not the poor, says Solomon, because he is poor:
neither oppress the afflicted etc. Prove. 22. Prove. 22.22.
These first words are capable of a double construction. First, Rob not the
poor, because he is poor: that is, Let not his poverty and inability to
withstand thee, encourage thee the rather to rob him. Which construction
agrees the reason given in the next verse, [ For the Lord will plead their
cause, and spoil the soul of those that spoiled them. -- 23.
As if he had said, Be well advised what you do: weak though they be, and can
do little for themselves; yet they have a strong one to take their part, who
will see that such as do them wrong shall not go unpunished. Yet is there
another sense to be made of those words also, neither unfitly nor unprofitably;
as thus, Rob not the poor, because he is poor: that is, Let the consideration
of his poverty keep thee off from meddling with him. 1. A little loss would be
his undoing; because he is poor. 2. And if thou because he is poor. 3. Or if it
could, yet is he no fit match for thee to exercise thy strength upon, if thou
art rich; because he is poor.

35. But herein especially may you behold the baseness of Oppression; that the
basest people, men of the lowest rank and spirit, are most insolent, and
consequently (according to the proportion of their power) the most oppressive.

when he shook him by the throat for a small debt, after his master had but
newly a sum incomparably greater? The reason of the difference was: the master
dealt nobly and freely and like himself; and had compassion; -- 27.
but the servant, being of a low and narrow spirit, must insult. Terent.
Senties qui vir siem. If a mean man in any of our towns or hamlets be a little
gotten up, to overtop most of his neighbors in wealth; or be put into some
little authority to deal under some great man for the disposing of his farms or
grounds; or have something to sell to his necessitous neighbor, ^^ at must buy
upon day; or have a little money lying by him to furnish another that for the
supply of his present necessities must sell off somewhat of that little at an
under-rate; or the like: it is scarce credible (did not every days experience
make proof of it,) how such a man will skrew up the poor man that falls into
his hands, without all mercy, and beyond all reason. Conclude hence all ye that
are of generous births or spirits, how unworthy that practice would be in you;
wherein men of the lowest minds and conditions can in their proportion) not
equal only, but even exceed you. Which should make you, not only to hate
Oppression, because it is wicked: but even to scorn it, because it is base; and
to despise it. [He that despises the gain of oppressions. Esaias 33.] This for
the second particular, whom have I oppressed? Esaias 33.15.


35. There is yet a third behind, against which Solomon protests as a branch
of Injustice also; which also concerned him more properly as a Judge: to wit
Bribery. [ Or of whose hands have I received a bribe, that I might blind mine
eyes therewith?] In the place now last cited the Prophet Esaias, speaking of an
upright just man, describes him amongst other things by this, that he shakes
his hands from h^l^ing of bribes: Esaias 33.15.
as a man would shake off a Viper or other venomous beast, that should offer to
fasten upon his hand, as Paul did at Mal a, Act. 28.15.
Acts 28. The word that here in the text is rendered Munus, a gift or a bribe
((...)) the Targum there renders (...) ( Mammon dishqar: whereunto that Mammon
of unrighteousness mentioned Luke 16. and wherewith our Savior would have rich
men make themselves friends, Luke 16.9.
may very well seem to have reference. Although I confess that phrase there may
not improbably the falseness, deceitfulness, and uncertainty of these wordly
riches, in opposition to spiritual riches a little after there called the true
riches: -- 11.
for so the words Mammon dishquar do properly import; as who say, the false or
lying riches, or (in comparison of the true and durable) riches falsely so
called. However, the phrase seems to be proverbial, and (taken in the former
sense) to bear this meaning in that place. As wordly wise men, that have suits
depending in the Courts, will attempt by bestowing gifts upon him or his
servants, to make the Judge their friend, that so the cause may be carried
wisdom should Christian men make themselves friends of the poor (who are Gods
favorites) by giving alms to them out of their worldly goods, that so they may
find favor with him at the day of judgment. The proverbial use of that
phrase (which made me the rather observe it) shows what was the common
opinion men held of gifts bestowed to procure favor in judgment: to wit, that
they were the Mammon of unrighteousness. And that in a double respect: first,
as the price of an unrighteous sentence, in the intention of the giver; and
then as a piece of unjust and unrighteous gain in the receiver. Prohibited the
Law, Exodus 23.8. Deuteronomy. 16.19.
as well as the other two branches of Injustice were; and that both frequently
and expressly: and taxed by the Prophet as a sin of a very high nature, Amos 5
12.
a mighty sin [I know your manifold transgressions, and your mighty sins: they
afflict the just, Fortia peccata. Vulg.
they take a bribe, and they turn aside the poor in the gate from their right.
Amos 5.

36. But it may be said, Since we have already comprehended all injuries under
the two former heads, Fraud and Oppression: how comes it to be here mentioned
as a third thing and distinct from them both? Either we must free it from being
injurious; or reduce it to one of the two, Fraud, or Oppression. I answer in
Bribery is properly a branch of Oppression. For if the bribe be exacted, or but
expected; yet so, as that there can be little hope of a favorable, or so much
as a fair hearing without it; then is it a manifest oppression in the receiver:
because he makes an advantage of that power, wherewith he is entrusted for the
administration of justice, to his own proper benefit, which ought not to be,
and is clearly an oppression. But if it proceed rather from the voluntary offer
of the giver, for the compassing of his own ends; then is it an oppression in
him: because thereby he gets an advantage in the favor of the Court against
his adversary, and to his prejudice. For observe it, the greatest oppressors,
are ever the greatest bribers, and manifest cause (besides the secret and just
judgment of God upon them) why oppressors seldom thrive in their estates,
near the proportion of their gettings. Even because so much of what comes in
by their oppressions, goes out again for the upholding of their oppressions.
It was not for nothing, you may well think, Solomon so yoaked these two things
together; Oppressing the poor, Prove. 22.16.
and giving to the rich in Prove. 22. [ He that oppresses the poor to increase
his riches, and he that gives to the rich shall surely come to want.] As he
has a spring one way, so he has a drain another way; which keeps him from
rising to that excess of height he aims at.

37. Bribery then is a branch of Oppression: That we have cl^^red. But yet one
part of the doubt remains: why, if it belong to one of the two, is it here
mentioned as a third species, different from both? For this I say; First, it
might be specially mentioned, as Judicature, in respect whereof especially
Samuel now stood upon his justification: whereas Frauds and most other
Oppressions are of a larger and more comprehensive extent. And secondly,
because it has a peculiar formality by it self, whereby it differs from
other injuries of either sort, in this: that whereas all other whether Frauds
and Oppressions are involuntary on one part, (for Volenti non fit injuria: no
man is willing to be either defrauded or oppressed, if he knew it, and knew how
to help it;) this of Bribery is done with the mutual knowledge and consent both
of the Giver and Receiver.

38. Which circumstance makes it (at least in this one respect) worse, then
either of the former: that whereas in other frauds and oppressions the one
party only is guilty, because they are done without the consent of the other
party; in this of Bribery both parties are guilty, because both consent.
Neither does this joint consent of both parties hinder, but that it is still
injurious. Because the injury that is hereby done, is not done to either of the
parties thereunto consenting, (supposing the consent on both parts free and
spontaneous;) but it is done by them both to a third party, namely, to the
adversary of him that gives the bribe: whose consent you will easily suppose
never to have been asked in the business. So that the injury non volenti.

39. Of the commonness of which sin, especially in inferior officers, who are
ever and anon trucking for expedition: it would be impertinent to speak from
this Text, wherein Samuel speaks of it only, as it might concern himself who
was a Judge. Of the heinousness of it in the sight of God, and the mischief it
does to the Commonwealth, when it is found in Judges and Magistrates, I shall
forbear to speak, (the time being withal now welnigh spent:) because out of
the confidence I have of the sincerity of those that now hear me, I deem the
labor needless. Only I cannot ( the offering it) but touch somewhat at that
property, which Samuel here ascribes to a bribe, of blinding the eyes. Solomon
speaks much of the powerful operation of gifts and bribes: Prove. 21.14. --
18.16. -- 17.8.
how they pacify anger, procure access into the presence of great persons, and
favor from them, and sundry the like, which are all of easy understanding,
and the truth of them (as well as the meaning) obvious. But the effect here
mentioned, of blinding the eyes, though somewhat more obscure, is yet oftener
found in the Scriptures, then any of the other. Samuel undoubtedly learnt it
from Moses, who has it twice: Once in Exodus, and again repeated in
Deuteronomy, Exodus 23.8. Deuteronomy. 16.19.
in the self-same words, ( Thou shall take no gift: for a gift blinds the
eyes of the wise, and perverteth (...).
the words of the righteous.) A marvelous power sure there is in them, that can
work upon men so strongly; (yea sometimes upon (...). Pindar.
wise and righteous men, as Moses his words express.) mouths, and bind their
hands, and blind their eyes; that they can neither speak, nor do, nor see
what is right. Euripid. in Medea. act. 4.
(...), as it is in Euripides: They say that even the gods may be tempted with
gifts. Very like; if applied to such gods as are spoken of in the Psalm, ( Dixi
Dij, I have said, ye are gods. Psalm. 82.6.
)

40. But then what is it to blind the eyes? or how can bribes do it? Justice
is not unfitly pourtrayed in the form of a man with his right eye open, to
look at the Cause; and his left eye shut or muffled, that he may not look at
the Person. Now a gift puts all this out of order, and sets it the quite
contrary way. It gives the left eye liberty, but too much; to look asquint
upon the person: but the right eye quite out, that it cannot discern the Cause.
Even as in the next foregoing Chapter Nahash the Ammonite would have
covenanted with the inhabitants of Iabesh-Gilead, 1 Samuel 11.2.
upon condition he might thrust out all their right eyes. From this property of
hood-winking and muffling up the eyes it is, that a Bribe is in the Hebrew (
the Text-word here) called (...) Copher, of (...) Caphar, to cover, to dawbe
up, or to draw over with lime, plaster, or the like. Whereunto our English
word, to cover has such nere affinity in the sound; that (were it not
apparently taken from the French Couurir, and that from the Latin Cooperire)
it might the Hebrew. But however it be for the word, the thing is clear enough:
this Copher does so cover and plaster up the eyes, that they cannot see to do
their office aright, and as they ought.

41. And the reason of all this is* because gifts, if they be handsomely
conveyed, and not tendered in the name, nor appearing in the likeness of
Bribes, (for then wise and righteous men will reject them with disdain, Rejecit
alto dona nocentium vultu. Hor. 4. Carm. 9. Esaias 33.15.
and shake their hands and laps from receiving them;) but I say, if they come
as presents only, and by way of kindness and respect: they are sometimes well
accepted, and that wise and righteous men; as testimonies of the love and
observance of the givers. And then the nature of ingenuous persons is such,
that they cannot but entertain a good opinion of those that show good respect
unto them; and are glad when any opportunity is offered them whereby to
manifest such their good opinion, and to requite one courtesy with another.
Whereby it comes to gifts by little and little, and by insensible degrees win
upon the affections of such men, as are yet just in their intentions, and would
not willingly be corrupted; and at the last over-master them: And the
affections once thoroughly possessed; (...). Antiphon (...). Plat. 5. de legib.
it is then no great mastery to do the rest, and to surprise the judgment. The
good Magistrate therefore, that would save his eyes, and preserve their sight,
had need not only to hate bribes, but to be very jealous of presents: lest some
of those things which he receives but as Gifts, be yet meant him for Bribes.
But especially to suspect those gifts as so meant, where the quantity and
proportion of the gift, considered and compared with the quality and condition
of the giver, may cast suspicion upon them: but to conclude them absolutely so
meant, if they be sent from persons that have business in the Courts.

42. The only thing now remaining to be spoken to from the Text, and that but
in a word or two, is Samuels Equity: in offering, in case any thing should be
truly charged against him in any the premises, to make the wronged parties
restitution. [Whose ox have I taken? or etc. And I will restore it you.]
Samuel was confident he had not wittingly done any man wrong, either by Fraud,
Oppression, Bribery; whereby he should be bound to make, or should need to
offer Restitution. Yet, partly to show what was fit to be done in such cases,
and his own readiness so to do, if there should be cause; and partly for that
it was possible, in so long time of his government, and amid so many causes as
passed through his hands, that he might through misinformation, precipitancy,
negligence, prejudice, or other humane frailty, have committed some oversight
in judgment, for which it might be reasonable for him to make some kind of
compensation to the parties thereby damnified: he here offers Restitution. A
duty, in case of Injury, most necessary: both for quieting the Conscience
within; and to give satisfaction to the and for the more assurance of the truth
and sincerity of our Si res aliena non redditur; non agitur poenitentia, sed
fingitur. Aug. Epist. 54.
repentance in the sight of God for the wrongs we have done. Without which (at
least in the desire and endeavor) there can be no true repentance for the sin,
and consequently no security of the remission of the guilt. That of Augustine,
Ibid.
Non dimittitur peccatum, nisi restituatur ablatum, is a famous received
Aphorism in this case: well known to all; but little considered, and less
practiced, by most.

43. There is an enforced Restitution; whereof perhaps Zophar Job 20. [ That
which he labored for, he shall restore, and not swallow it down: Job 20.18.
according to his substance shall the restitution be, and he shall not rejoice
therein.] and such as the Law imposed upon thefts and other manifest wrongs:
which although not much worth, is yet better then none. But as Samuels offer
here was voluntary: so Voluntary Restitution, that best pleases God, pacifieth
the Conscience, and in some measure satisfies the world. Such was that of
Zacheus Luke 19. in restoring fourefold to every man from whom he had gained
any thing wrongfully. It may be feared, Luke 19.8.
if every Officer, that has to do in or about the Courts of Justice, should
be tied to that proportion, many one would have but a very small surplusage
remaining, whereout to bestow the one moity to pious uses, as Zacheus there did.

44. There is scarce any one point in the whole body of Moral Divinity, that
sounds so harsh to the ear, or relisheth so harsh in the pala^e of a
worldling, as this of Restitution does. To such a durus sermo indeed; a hard,
very hard saying: yet as hard as it seems to be, it is full of reason, and
Equity. So full, that I dare confidently say, who ever he be, that complains
of it as a hard imposition, when he is required to restore to the right owner
that which he has unjustly taken from him; that man is (...): there needs no
other testimony nor evidence against him, then his own C^nscience to condemn
him. Nay, I may say yet more; There needs not so much as that: his own mouth
will do it. Ex ore tuo, thou unjust man! I bid thee not, answer hard with thee
to restore it back, to him that has a true right in it: did it not go as hard
(think thou) with him to part with it before to thee, who had not the same
right thereunto that he had? I say no more: consider it well, and then remember
the grand Rule never to be forgotten, Do as you would be done to.

45. Concerning the manner of Restitution and the measure, the time, place,
persons and other circumstances thereunto belonging; many things there are of
considerable moment, and very needful this Subject: and the Casuists are large
in their discourses thereof. But for the thing it self in general, thus much is
clear from the Judicial Law of God given by Moses to the people of Israel; from
the letter whereof though Christians be free, ( positive Laws binding none but
those to whom they were given,) yet the Equity thereof still binds us as a
branch of the unchangable Law of Nature. That whosoever shall have wronged his
neighbor in any thing committed to his custody, or in fellowship, or in any
thing taken away by violence or by fraud, or in detaining any found thing, or
the like; is bound to restore it: and that in integrum, to the utmost farthing
of what he has taken, if he be able. Not so only, but beside the principal, to
offer some little overplus also, by way of compensation for the damage; if at
least the wronged party have sustained any damage thereby, and unless he shall
be willing freely to remit it. Moses his Law speaks of a fifth part more: as
if he had twenty shekels, the restitution was to be after the rate of four and
twenty. See the sixth of Leviticus, in the beginning of the Chapter. The
assignment of that proportion belonged to the Jewish people, and the obligation
thereof therefore expired together with that policy: but yet still reason and
equity require that something be done. The Lord give us all hearts to do that
which is equal and right, and in all our dealings with others to have evermore
the fear of God before our eyes: knowing that of the Lord the righteous Judge
we shall in our souls receive at the last great assize, according to what we
have done in our bodies here, whether it be good or evil. Now to God the
Father, etc.


Prove. 19.21. There are many devices in a man's heart: nevertheless the counsel
of the Lord, that shall stand.


1. IT being impossible for us to know God absolutely and as he is, (his
essence being infinite, and so altogether incomprehensible by any but himself:)
the highest degree of knowledge we can hope to comparison with our selves, and
other creatures. Whereby it is possible for us, making the comparison right,
and remembering ever the infinite disproportion of the things compared, to come
to some little kind of glimmering guess what he is; by finding and well
considering what he is not.

2. But even in this way of learning we are oftentimes very much at a loss.
Because we fall for the most part either short, or over in that, from which we
are to take our first rise toward the right knowledge of God: to wit, the
right knowledge of our selves. we see but in a glass, as says the Apostle: 1
Cor. 13.12.
but we mistake also most an end very grossly; because we are apt to make use of
a false glass. We think foolishly, (yea and wickedly too sometimes, as it is
Psam 50.) that God is even such an one as our selves: Psalm. 50.21.
and yet (God knows) little do we know what our selves are. There is so much
deceitfulness in our hearts, Jer. 17.9. Psalm. 94.11.
so much vanity in our thoughts, so much pride in our spirits: that, though we
hear daily with our ears, that man is like a thing of naught, that he is
altogether vanity* yea lighter then vanity it self; Psalm 144.4. -- 39.5. --
62.9.
and see daily before our eyes experiments enough to convince us, that all this
is true: yet we are willing to betray our selves into a belief, that sure we
are something, when indeed we are nothing; Gal. 6.3.
and to please our selves but too much in our own ways and imaginations.

3. To rectify this so absurd and dangerous an error in us, (absurd in the
ground, and dangerous in the consequents;) and withal to our selves to a better
knowledge of God: useful (amongst other things) it is, to consider the wide
difference that is betwixt Gods ways and ours, betwixt our purposes and his.
Esa. 55.8, 9.
For my thoughts are not your thoughts, says the Lord by the Prophet, neither
are your ways my ways. For as the heavens are higher then the earth, so (but
much more then so too) are my ways higher then your ways, and my thoughts
then your thoughts. Weigh them the one against the other in the balance of the
Sanctuary; or but even by the beam of your own reason and experience, so it be
done unpartially: and you will easily acknowledge both the vanity ours, and the
certainty and stability of his, thoughts and purposes.

4. We have a Proverb common among us, that yields the conclusion; Man
purposes, but God disposes. And this Proverb of Solomon in the Text
discovers ground enough wherefrom to infer that conclusion, There are many
devices in a man's heart: nevertheless the counsel of the Lord, that shall
stand. And that in three remarkable differences between the one and the other,
therein expressed.

First, in the different Names of the things. Ours are but Devices; His is
Counsel.

Secondly, in their different Number. Ours are devices in the plural number,
and with the express addition of multiplicity also, Many devices: His but one,
Counsel in the singular.

Thirdly, in their different manner of Existing. Ours are but conceived in the
heart; we have not strength enough to bring them forth, or to give them a being
ad extra; -- many devices in a man's heart: But he is able to give his a real
subsistency, and to make them stand fast and firm, in despite of all
opposition The counsel of the Lord, that shall stand.

5. The whole amounts to these two points. First, when we have tossed many and
various thoughts in our heads, amidst the throng of our hopes, and fears, and
desires, and cares; cast this way, and danger, how to compass this or that
design, how to gratify this friend, or advance that child, how to
counter-work or defeat this or that enemy or competitor; when we have summoned
all our powers and set all our wits on work to manage the design we have
pitched upon, and made all so sure that there seems nothing wanting to bring
our intentions to the wished end: Unless God say Amen, that is, unless it
please him either in mercy to bless our endeavors with success for our
comfort, or at least for some other secret ends agreeable to his wisdom and
justice suffer them to effect; they shall all come to nothing, Psalm. 58.8.
and be as the untimely fruit of a woman, which after much pain and anguish to
her that conceived it, perishes in the womb, and never sees the Sun.
Secondly, what God has in his everlasting counsel determined, either to do
himself, or to suffer to be done by any of his Creatures, shall whether we
like it or dislike it, whether we will or no, undoubtedly even so come to pass
as he has appointed. The Lord will be King, Psalm. 99.1.
(Fremat licet orbis) and do whatsoever pleases him in heaven and earth, in
the sea and in all deep places, Psalm. 136.6.
be unquiet, and all the people that dwell therein never so impatient.

6. Which two points, to wit the vanity of our devices, and the stability of
Gods counsels, by reason of the opposition that is betwixt them, whereby they
mutually give and receive light and confirmation either to and from other, are
therefore very frequenly joined together in sundry places of Scripture. Psalm.
2.1.
As in Psalm. 2. the rage and fury of Jews and Gentiles, of Princes and People,
against the Lord and his anointed; their imaginations, insurrections, -- 2.
and joint consultations to effect their intendments; and the^r professed
resolutions to break the bonds and to cast away the cords of their bounden
allegiance; -- 3.
how vain and ineffectual they are, and instead of that liberty and advantage
they had promised to themselves, procure them nothing but scorn and vexation,
is largely declared in the beginning of the Psalm: -- 4, 5.
and then follows in few words, how effectual (notwithstanding all their
imaginations and endeavors to the contrary) the purpose of God was in setting
up the kingdom of Christ, Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Sion. --
6. Job 5.12. -- 13.
So in Job 5. Eliphaz shows the great power of God; first, in disappointing
the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise;
but the wise are taken in their own and then in fulfilling his own counsel of
saving the poor from the sword, the mouth, and the hand of the mighty. -- 15.
And the like does David again in Psam 33. fully and in words agreeable to
these of Solomon, even in terminis. The Lord brings the counsel of the
heathen to naught, Psalm. 33.10.
and makes the devices of the people of none effect. That for the first point:
The counsel of the Lord shall stand for ever and ever, and the thoughts of his
heart from generation to generation. Psalm. 33.11.


7. For the better evidencing and enforcing of both which points, I shall
proceed in this order. First, to consider of the three differences formerly
mentioned and contained in the Text, each of them severally and apart: then
(taking the whole together) Secondly, to show some Reasons or grounds thereof;
and lastly, to propose some profitable Inferences from the same.

8. The first Difference is in the Names: Man's Devices; but the Counsel of the
Lord. Our most serious thoughts, the most mature and best digested
deliberations and advices of the sons of men, and all the most exquisite
resolutions, and advantageous endeavors ensuing thereupon, are but devices in
comparison. Imaginations, Fancies, or if you can find any lighter or emptier
name whereby to call them. Indeed all these expressions are but too high, to
render to the full the extreme vacuity and nothingness of all humane devices.
Very Chimeraes they are; Castles in the air: that have no real existence in
them, no base or bottom under them to uphold them.

9. I know not readily, how to represent them unto you better Fancies: and so
might the word be well enough here rendered. There are many fancies, (or
fantastical devices) in a man's heart. Now the vanity of men's fancies may
something appear in mad men: in whom the inflammation of blood distempering the
brain, as it hinders the operation of the mind, and depriveth them of all
solidity of judgment; so it adds strength and nimbleness to the fancy. Whence
it comes to pass, that the sharpest Satirical wits, with all the help of Art
and study, cannot ordinarily invent such shrewd and stinging answers, nor make
such quick and smart returns of wit, to those that talk a mad man sometimes in
a frantic fit will hit upon of a sudden.

10. But in nothing is the Vanity of men's fancies more apparent, then in our
ordinary dreams. Wherein we often fancy to our selves golden mountains, and
many other such things, as never were, nor ever shall be in rerum natura; such
as have neither coherence nor possibility in them; and such as when we are
awake, we do not only find to be void of all truth and reality, but we laugh
at as ridiculous, and wonder how such senceless and inconsistent should ever
come into our heads. And yet whilst we are dreaming, we entertain them with as
full a persuasion of the truth and reality of them, as we do those things
whereof we have the greatest assurance in the world; without any the least
suspicion to the contrary: and are accordingly affected with them, pleased or
displeased, even as they suite with, or go cross to, our natural desires. But
when we awake, we many times can scarce well tell what we dreamed of, much less
do we find our selves possessed of those things which in our dreams we fancied
to be ours.

11. As these dreams of one asleep, or those flashes of wit that come from a
mad man: such are all the plots and projects, the thoughts and purposes of men,
wherewith they so much please or disquiet themselves about any thing that is
done under the sun. Of all which our Solomon, out of his great wisdom and much
experience, Eccles. 2.1, 2. etc.
that they are but vanity, and folly, and madness. They that applaud themselves
in their cunning and deep contrivances; that trust to their wealth, power,
strength, or policy; that think they are able to carry all before them, and to
do what they list: are all the while but in a dream. So David affirms of the
wicked in the midst of their greatest prosperity and successes. Like as a
dream when one awaketh, Psalm. 73.20.
so shall thou make their Image to vanish out of the City. Psalm. 73. and Psalm.
76. The proud are robbed: they have slept their sleep; -- 76.5.
and all the men of might (that is, that thought themselves such mighty men,
whilst they continued in their dream,) when they awaked, found And the Prophet
Esaias says concerning all the nations that fight against mount Sion, that they
shall be even as when a hungry man dreameth that he is eating, but he awaketh,
and his soul is empty: Esaias 29.7, 8.
or as when a thirsty man dreameth that he is drinking, but when he awaketh,
behold he is faint, and his soul has appetite. Esaias 29.

12. You may see in these representations, what a poor nothing is all humane
wisdom. Those devices which we applaud in our selves or others, as matters of a
great reach, and contrived with deep policy, are no better then mere fancies or
dreams: whimsies, as Spiders web, Esaias 59.5, 6.
(that is one of the Prophets comparisons too) a thing of great curiosity to
the eye, spun of a most fine subtle thread, and in a most exact proportion: but
a thing of no strength at all, unless against a small fly, (the greater ones
will break through it;) and the light touch of a besom strikes it all away in
a moment.

13. But as for Gods eternal purposes, it is not so with them. We are not to
conceive of them, as of our own vain devices; but rather as of sage counsels.
The Counsel of the Lord. By which name they are also styled in Psalm. 33.11. and
elsewhere in the according to the purpose of him that works all things after
the Counsel of his own will. Ephesians. 1.11. Yet is not this to be understood
properly neither: for Counsel is a thing, that in strict propriety of speech
cannot be attributed unto God: for who has been his Counselor? Romans 11.34.
Counsel imports always some debate with ones self or others, deliberation,
what is best to do or not to do, and how to do it: and consequently must
suppose some impotency or defect either in respect of knowledge, or action, or
both. He that knows perfectly at the first thought of a thing what is fit to
be done, and is assured nothing can hinder him for doing the same, needs not
either to ask or to take counsel about it. God therefore, whose both wisdom and
power is infinite, has not any need or use of Counsel.

14. The truth is, as the name of Devices, was too high an appellation to
bestow upon our vain imaginations, if we knew a Counsel is too low, to bestow
upon Almighty Gods eternal purposes, if we knew a better: But the Scriptures
fitted to our capacity, speaks of the things of God in such language, and
under such notions, as best agree with our weak conceptions, but far below the
dignity and Majesty of the things themselves. Counsels then they are called, in
comparison of men's devices: and the reason of the comparison stands thus. As
those resolutions* which follow upon good advice and mature deliberation, where
all circumstances are taken into due consideration, and the conveniences and
inconveniences examined and weighed (which we call counsels) solid, and likely
to prove more successeful, then those sudden motions that rash light heads take
up in a heat or humor, and carry on without either fear or wit: so, (but
infinitely more then so,) do the wise purposes and Counsels of God exceed the
vain imaginations and devices of men. As the lightning, which is but a flash,
and then vanishes; so are these: but those, like the Sun, which has a fullness
of durable light and heat within it self always alike, howsoever it may appear
to us sometimes more and sometimes less.

15. The second difference in the Text, is in the Number. Ours Devices in the
plural; many Devices: His but one; Counsel in the singular. Men's purposes are
various, and changeable. Seldom do we continue long in one mind; but upon
every slight occasion, as the Weathercock with the wind, we are ready to turn
and face about. What between fears, and hopes, desires and cares, our thoughts
are so pulled and barrowed this way and that way; that many times we are so
distracted in our minds, that we cannot well tell what we would have or not
have, to hold to. Little children we know are eagerly fond to have any toy they
see; Sub nutrice puella velut si luderet infan^, Quod cupide petiit, mature
plena reliquit. Horat. 2. ep. 1.
but throw it away presently, as soon as they see another (perhaps a verier toy
then it) and long as eagerly for that; ( Quod petiit spernit:) There is a spice
of this childishness remaining in all the sons of Adam even to their dying day.
Whether it be from the natural fickleness of our minds, longing after novelty;
(...). Eurip. in Orest.
or from the unsufficiency of any thing in this world to satisfy the appetites
of the soul; or from whatsoever other cause it proceeds: certain it is, that
we cannot affect any thing long without some weariness and satiety. Whence it
comes to pass that we seek for that contentment in variety, which we cannot
find in any one thing though never so excellent and desirable. Thus it fares
with us, according to what our Savior said of Martha, (...), We are troubled,
Luke 10.41.
(or rather we trouble our selves) about many things: or what our Solomon says
of men in general, Eccl. 7.29.
that they have sought out many inventions. Many fancies we entertain: and as
one nail another, clavus clavum,) so one fancy drives out another, in
insinitum.

16. Which multiplicity and variety of devices in us, is a most clear and
demonstrative evidence of the vanity and unsufficiency thereof: even as in most
other things multiplicity argues infirmity. As there are many Stars in the
Firmament, because they give but a little light: but one Sun serves the turn,
without need of more, to give light to the whole World. It were a superfluous
curiosity for a man to provide two strings to his Bow, if he were sure one
thousands of horses and men prepared for the managing of a war, (...). Aristot.
de mund. ca. 6.
because one or a few are presumed to be unsufficient for the work. By this
very Argument the Apostle in the Epistle to the Hebrews proves the
insufficiency of the legal Priesthood and Sacrifices: the Priests were many,
and there was ^n iteration of the Sacrifices; because of the mortality of the
one, and the unprofitableness of the other to take away sins. Heb. 7.23. -- 28.
and 10.1, -- 14.
As on the contrary he proves the sufficiency of the Priesthood and sacrifice
of Christ, from the unchangeableness, and One-ship (if I may so say) both of
Priest and Sacrifice.

men's devices that they are so many. But it is the honor of God, that his
Counsel is but one, and unchangeable. We find is expressed with that adjunct
Heb. 6. (...), the immutability of his Counsel. Heb. 6.17, 18
And it is there laid down as the great foundation of our Christian hope, and
the very strength of all our consolation. Quod scripsi, scripsi. What he has
written in the secret book of his determinate counsel, (though it be counsel to
us, and uncertain; until either he reveal it, or the event discover it; yet) is
it most certain in it self, and altogether unchangeable. devices many times,
which we afterward repent: (...). Eurip in Hippol. act. 2.
and truly our second thoughts are most an end the wiser. But with God there is
no after-counsel, to correct the errors of the former: he knows not any such
thing as repentance; it is altogether hid from his eyes. Osee 13.14. Genesis 6.6;
Jer. 18.8.
He is indeed sometimes in the Scriptures said to repent, as Genesis 6. and in
the business of Niniveh, Jona 3.10.
and elsewhere. But it is not ascribed unto passions and affections are, as
grief, sorrow etc. (...), to import some actions of God, eventually and
according to the manner of our understanding, like unto the operations which
those passions produce in us: but have nothing at all of the nature of those
passions in them. So that still, that is eternally true, which was spoken
indeed by a false Prophet, but whose spirit and tongue was at that time guided
by the God of truth, Numbers 23.19. God is not a man that he should lie;
Neither the son of man, that he should repent. His Counsel therefore stands
ever one and the same; not reversed by repentance, or countermanded by any
after-counsel.

18. Follows the third Difference, which consists in their Efficacy, and is
expressed in the Text by their different manner of Existing. Many devices may
be in a man's heart, but it is not in his power to make them stand: unless God
will, they shall never be accomplished. But in despite of all the world, the
counsel of the Lord shall stand: nothing can hinder, or disappoint that, but
that it shall have the intended effect.

19. The Heart, although sometimes it be put for the appetitive part of the
soul only, as being the proper seat of the desires the Head or Brain is of the
conceptions or thoughts: yet is it very often in Scripture, and so it is here,
taken more largely; so as to comprehend the whole soul, in all its faculties,
as well the apprehensive as the appetitive; and consequently takes in the
Thoughts, as well as the Desires of the Soul. Whence we read of the thoughts
of the heart, Genesis 6.5. Act. 8.22. Luke 24.38. Matthew. 15.19.
of thoughts arising in the heart, of thoughts proceeding from out the heart,
and the like. The meaning then is, that multitudes and variety of devices may
be in a man's head or in his heart, in his thoughts and desires, in his
intentions and hopes: but unless God give leave, execution, and to give them a
real existency. -- They imagined such a device, as they are not able to
perform. Psalm 21. Psalm. 21.11.
Whatsoever high conceits men may have of the fond imaginations of their own
hearts, as if they were some goodly things; yet the Lord that better
understands us, then we do our selves, knows all the thoughts of men that
they are but vain. Psalm 94. Psalm. 94.11.
And this he knows, not only for the (...), that it is so, by his omniscience
and prescience; but for the (...) too (which is the most perfect kind of
knowledge,) why it is he that makes the devices of the people, (ey, and of
Princ^s too, as it is added in some translations) to be of none effect. Psalm.
33.10.
Psalm 33.

20. Possibly the heart may be so full, that it may run over, make some offers
outward by the mouth, (for out of the) and the tongue may boast great things,
and talk high. It may so indeed, Matthew. 12.34. Jam. 3.5.
but that boasting does not any thing at all to further the business, or to
give the thoughts of the heart a firm bottom or base whereon to rest; it many
times rather helps to overturn them the sooner. We call it vapouring: and well
may we so call it. For as a vapor, that arises from the earth, is scattered
with the wind, vanishes, and comes to nothing: So are all the imaginations
and devices that are conceived in the heart of man, blasted when the Lord
blows upon them, and then they come to nothing.

Counsels of his heart, they shall stand: Rooted and established, like the
mountains. The foundation of God stands firm, though spoken by the Apostle
in another sense, is most true in this also. 2 Timothy 2.19.
What he has purposed either himself to do, or to have done by any of his
creatures, shall most certainly and infallibly come to pass in every
circumstance, just as he has appointed it. It is established in the heavens:
(...)
and though all the powers in earth and hell should join their forces together,
set to all their shoulders and strength against it, Psalm. 89.2, 119.89.
and thrust sore at it to make it fall; yet shall they never be able to move it
or shake remove it from the place where it stands, or to overthrow it. His
name is Jehovah: it signifies as much as essence or being. 1. Not only because
of the eternity of his own being, and that from himself, and underived from any
other; 2. Nor yet because he is the author of being to all other things that
are: 3. But also for that he is able to give a being, reality, and subsistence
to his own will and word, to all his purposes and promises. -- Da voci tuae
vocem virtutis. What he has appointed, none can disappoint. His counsel does,
shall, must stand. My Counsel shall stand; and I will do all my pleasure. Esaias
46.10.

differences has sufficiently discovered, the weakness frailty and
unsuccessfulness of Men's devices on the one side; and on the other side, the
stability unchangablenesse and unfailingnesse of Gods Counsels. Whereof, the
consideration of the Reasons of the said differences will give us yet farther
assurance: and those Reasons taken from the Sovereignty, the Eternity, the
Wisdom, and the Power of God.

23. First, God is the prima causa, the sovereign agent, and first mover, in
every motion and inclination of the Creature: Men, ey and Angels too, who far
excel them in strength, are but secondary agents, subordinate causes, and as it
were instruments to do his will. Now the first cause has such a necessary
influence into all the operations of second causes, Psalm. 103.20, 21.
that if the concurrence thereof be withheld, their operations must cease. The
providence of God in ordering the world, and the acting of the creatures by his
actuation of them, is Rota in rota, (so represented to Ezekiel in a vision:
Ezekiel. 1.16.
) like the motion of a Clock or other artificial engine, wheels one within
another, some bigger, some lesser; but all depend upon the first great wheel,
which moves all the rest, Acts 17.28.
and without which none of the rest can move. In him we live, and move, and
have our being: and in his hands are the hearts of the greatest Kings, (and how
much more then of meaner persons;) which he turns and bends which way
soever he pleases, Prove. 21.1. Be the Ax never so sharp and strong, yet can it
not cut any thing, unless the hand of the workman move it: and then it cutteth
but where he would have it, and that more or less, as he puts more or less
strength unto it. No more can Men, whatsoever strength wit or power they are
endued with, bring their own devices to pass; but when, and where, and so far
forth only, as the Lord thinks fit to make use of them. Pharaohs Chariot may
hurry him apace to the place of his destruction, because God had so appointed
it: but anon God takes off the wheels, Exodus 14.25.
and the Chariot can move no farther, but leaves him helpless in the midst of
the chanel.

24. So vain are all men's devices, as to the serving of their own ends, and the
accomplishment of their own desires. Yet does Almighty God so order these
otherwise vain things by his overruling providence, as to make them
subservient to his everlasting counsels. For all things serve him, Psalm.
119.91. Happy, thrice happy, they voluntary service; that can say with David,
and in his sense, Psalm. 116.16.
Behold O Lord, how that I am thy servant, Psalm. 116. that have devoted
themselves faithfully and accordingly bend their endeavors to do him true and
laudable service, by obeying his revealed will. But certainly whether they will
or no, though they think of nothing less, they shall serve him to the
furthering and accomplishing of his secret will. As we find, my servant David
often, as his servant in the one kind: Jer. 25.9; 43.10; Ezekiel. 29.20.
so we sometimes meet with my servant Nebuchadnezzar, as his servant in the
other kind.

25. Another Reason of the differences aforesaid is from Gods Man is but of
yesterday, and his thoughts casual. They go and come, (...). Aristot. de
divinat. cap. 1. (...). Arist. de incessu animal. c. 7.
as it happens; without any certain rule and order. And as himself is;
mutable, fickle, and uncertain: so are the things he has to do withal, and
whereabouts he is conversant; subject to contingencies and variations. Tempora
mutantur. So many new unexpected accidents happen every hour, which no wit of
man could foresee; that may make it necessary for us many times to depart from
our former most advised resolutions: as the Mariner must strike sail again,
(perhaps when he has but newly ^oyst it up,) if the wind and weather change.
Sometimes a very small inconsiderable accident great turn in a business of the
greatest moment. A Smith in setting on a shoe chances to drive the nail a
little aside; the Horse is pricked; the prick endangereth the Horse, and the
Horse the Rider; upon the defeat of the Rider General or some Commander of
special use) the battle is lost; upon the issue of that battle may depend the
state of a whole Kingdom, and in the state of that may the interest of so many
Princes and Kingdoms be involved, that a very little oversight in a very mean
person may occasion very great alterations in a great part of the world. So
easily may men's devices be disappointed, and their expectations frustrated.

26. But the Counsels of God are, as himself is; Eternal, and unchangeable. Ego
Deus and non mutor, I am God, and am not changed: as if he had said, Mal. 3.6.
(...). Arist. 1. de coelo. 9.
The nature of the Godhead is not capable of any change, nor subject to
mutability. All change is either for the better, for the worse: but God cannot
change for the better, because he is already best; nor for the worse, for then
he should cease to be best. It is therefore impossible he should change at all.
His determinations therefore are unalterable, more then the laws of the Medes
and Persians: for time has long since altered those Laws, but his counsels
remain yesterday, and to day, the same, and for ever. Chance, and (if you will)
Fortune also may have place in the affairs of men, and the things that are done
under the Sun: But to him that dwells in heaven, that inhabiteth Eternity,
that knew from the beginning and before the beginning of the world all things
that are done in heaven casual, new, or unexpected, to cause any change of
purpose in him.

27. A third Reason there is from the wisdom of God. There is folly in all the
sons of men. They know but a very small part of the things that are in the
world: and those things they do know, they know but in part. Besides their
natural ignorance; through precipitancy, misinformation, prejudice, partial
affections, and sundry other causes, they are subject to very many mist^kes and
aberrations: whereby it comes to pass, that the wisest men sometimes are
foully overseen, and are fain to take up the Fools plea, and to cry Non

28. But as for God; he, and he alone, is wise. (...) -- the only wise God, 1 Timothy 1. As we are sure he will not deceive any, 1 Timothy 1.17. Psalm. 147.5.
being of infinite goodness: so we may be sure he cannot be deceived by any,
being of infinite wisdom. There is such a fullness of wisdom in him, that it
has left no room for second thoughts, or after-counsels: nor can there be
imagined any cause, why he should retract or reverse any of that he has
determined to do, either in part or in whole.

29. Lastly, as his Wisdom, so is his Power also infinite. (...). Arist. 1. de
coelo. 7.
Man devise, purpose, and resolve upon a course for the obtaining of his
intentions; and that possibly with so good advice, and upon such probable and
rational grounds, that there appears no reason to the contrary, why he should
not persist in the same mind still, and pursue that his said resolution. And
yet there may a thousand impediments intervene, to obstruct the business; so
that it shall not be in the of his hand, to remove those obstacles, whereby to
accomplish the desires of his heart. O Lord, says the Prophet Jeremy, I know
that the way of man is not in himself: Jer. 10.23.
it is not in man that walks, to direct his steps. And our Solomon, a little
before in this book; A man's heart devises his way: Prove. 16.9.
but the Lord directs his steps.

30. But as for the Lord; his Power has no bars or bounds, other then those of
his own will. Quicquid voluit, fecit. Whatsoever the Lord pleased, Psalm. 135.6.
that did he in heaven, and in earth; in the sea and in all deep places. For
who has ever resisted his will? Romans 9. Does he mean his revealed will think
you? Rom 9.19. (...). Hom. Odyss. (...).
Surely not: thousands have resisted and resist that will, the will, and the
commandments of God. But he means it of his secret will, the will of his
everlasting Counsels and purposes: and that too of an effectual resistance,
such a resistance as shall hinder the accomplishment of that will. For
otherwise there are thousands that offer resistance to that also, if their
resistance could prevail. But all resistance as well of the one sort as of the
other is in vain, as to that end: Though hand join in hand, it will be to no
purpose; the right hand of the Lord will have the pre-eminence when all is
done. Psalm. 118.16.
Associate your selves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird
your selves, and ye shall be broken in pieces. Take counsel together, and it
shall Esaias 8.9, 10. But the counsel of the Lord, that shall stand; and none
shall be able to hinder it.

31. Lay all these together, the Sovereignty, the Eternity, the Wisdom, and the
Power of God, (and in all these God will be glorified:) and you will see great
reason, why the Lord should so often blast men's devices, bring all their
counsels and contrivances to naught, 1 Cor. 1.19.
and take the wise in their own craftiness. Even to let men see, in their
disappointment, -- 3.19.
the vanity of all humane devices: that they might learn not to glory in, or
trust to, their own wisdom, or strength, or any thing else in themselves, or
in any creature, but that he that glories might glory in the Lord only. --
1.31.


32. Let every one of us therefore learn (that I may now proceed to the
Inferences) from the consideration of what we have heard. 1. Inference.
First of all, not to trust too much to our own wit, neither to lean to our own

imaginations, fancies, or dreams of our own hearts. Though our purposes should
be honest, and not any ways sinful either in Matter, End, Means, or other
Circumstance: yet if we should be over-confident of their success, rest too
much upon our own skill, contrivances, or any worldly help; like enough they
may worse purposes, propose to themselves baser ends, or make use of more
unwarrantable means; to prosper to our grief and loss, yea possibly to our
destruction: if it be but for this only, to chastise us for resting too much
upon outward helps, and making flesh our arm, and not

33. Who knows but Judgment may, nay, who knows not that Judgment must
(says the Apostle; that is, in the ordinary course of Gods providence usually
does) begin at the house of God. 1 Pet. 4.17.
Who out of his tender care of their well-doing, will sooner punish (temporally
I mean) his own children, when they take pride in their own inventions, and
sooth themselves in the devices of their own hearts; then he will his professed
enemies, that stand at defiance with him, and openly fight against him. These
he suffers many times to go on in their impieties, and to climb up to the
height of their ambitious desires: that in the mean time he may make injustice
and oppression for the scourging of those of his own howshold, and in the end
get himself the more glory by their destruction.

34. But then Secondly, 2. Inference.
howsoever Judgment may begin at the house of God, most certain it is, it shall
not end there: but the hand of God and his revenging justice shall at last
reach the house of the wicked oppressor also. And that, not with temporary
punishments only, as he did correct his own: but (without repentance) evil
shall hunt them to their everlasting destruction, that despise his known
Counsels, to follow the cursed devices and imaginations The Persecutors of God
in his servants, of Christ in his members; that say in the pride of their
hearts, ( with our tongues, with our wits, with our arms and armies we will
prevail: We are they that ought to speak, and to rule: Psalm. 12.4.
who is Lord over us? We have Counsel and strength for war etc.) what do they,
but even kick against the pricks? Esaias 36.5. Act. 9.5.
as the phrase is Act. 9. which pierce into the heels of the kicker, and work
him much anguish; but themselves remain as they were before without any
alteration, or abatement of their sharpness. God delights to get himself
honor, and to show the strength of his arm, Exodus 14.17. Luke 1.51.
by scattering such in the imagination of their hearts: and that especially
when they are arrived (and not ordinarily till then) almost at the very highest
pitch of their designs. When they are in the top of their jollity, and gotten
to the uppermost roundle of the ladder; then does he put to his hand, tumble
them down headlong at once* and then how suddenly do they consume, perish, and
come to a fearful end? Psalm. 73.19.
Then shall they find, (but too late,) what their pride would not before
suffer them to believe, to be a terrible truth, that all their devices were but
folly, and that the Counsel of the Lord must stand.

35. A terrible truth indeed to them: but Thirdly, of most comfortable
consideration to all those, 3. Inference.
that with patience and cheerfulness suffer for the testimony of God or a good
conscience, and in a good cause, under the insolences of proud and powerful
persecutors. When their enemies have bent all the strength of their wits and
power to work their destruction: God can, (and as he sees it instrumental to
his everlasting counsels will,) infatuate all their counsels, devices and
stratagems, bring all their preparations and enterprises to naught, and turn
them all to their destruction, his own glory, 2 Samuel 15.31.
and the welfare of his servants. 1. Either by turning their counsels into
folly, as he did Achitophels. 2. Or by diversion; finding them work elsewhere:
as Saul was fain to leave the pursuit of David, 1 Samuel 23.26, 27.
when he and his men had compassed him about and were ready to take him, upon a
message then brought him of an invasion of the land by the Philistines. Esaias
37.7, 9.
And as he sent a blast upon Senacherib, by a rumor that he heard of the King
of Ethiopia's coming forth to war against him; which caused him to desert his
intended siege of Jerusalem. 3. Or by putting a blessing into the mouth of
their enemies, Number. 23.3.
instead of a curse: as he guided the mouth of Balaam, contrary to his
intendment and desire. 4. Or he can melt the hearts of his enemies into a kind
of compassion, or cause them to relent, so as to be at peace with them when
they meet, Prove. 16.7.
though they came out against them with minds and preparations of hostility:
as he did Labans first, Genesis 31.29. Genesis 33 4.
and Esaus afterward, against Jacob.

36. Howsoever, some way or other he can curb and restrain either their malice,
Jer. 18.18.
or power, or both; that when they have devised devices against them, (...).
Homer. Iliad. (...).
as they did against Jeremiah, they shall not cunning rider that suffers a
wild untamed Horse to fling and fly out under him, but with the bridle in his
jaws can give him a sudden stop at his pleasure, even in the midst of his
fullest career: Or as a skilful fisher, when some great fish has caught the
bait, lets it tumble and play upon the line awhile, and beat it self upon
the water or against the bank, and at last when he spieth his time, strikes
the hook into him, and draws him to the land. So can the Lord deal, and often
does, with the great Behemoths and Leviathans of the world: he lets them go
on in the pleasing devices of their own seduced hearts, and suffers them to
prosper in their mischievous imaginations, (according Psalm. 140.9. Psalm. 7 3.6.
or as the new translation renders it Psalm. 140.) in their wicked devices,
till they be even covered over with pride and violence. But when the time is
come, which he in his eternal counsel has appointed, Esaias 37.29.
he puts his hook into their noses, and his bridle into their lips, (they
are both his own expressions by the Prophet, in the case of Hezekiah and
Senacherib,) and so defeateth all their malicious purposes for the future. And
though they fret and rage for anger, and are as impatient as a wild Bull in a
net (which is another of the Prophets expressions elsewhere: Esaias. 51.20.
) yet is it to no purpose: though they gnash with their teeth through
indignation and envy, yet will they, nill they, Psalm. 112.10.
they shall melt away, and their desires shall perish. Whereof, besides sundry
examples in Scripture^, God has given us of this nation some remarkable
experiments: especially in two never to be forgotten defeats, the one of the
Invincible Armado in eighty eight, the other of the Gunpowder-Treason since.

examples and experiments, would be as a sovereign Cordial, to relieve our
spirits, and sustain our souls with comfort, against those deliquia animae,
those fainting fits that sometimes come upon us, when we are either
over-burdened under the pressures of our own sufferings, or overgrieved at the
prosperous successes of our cruel enemies. The comfort is; that neither they
nor their devices can prevail against us any farther then God will give them
leave: and we know, that if we cleave steadfastly to him, he will not give them
leave to prevail any farther then shall be for our good. He that by his power
stilleth the raging of the Sea, that has set it its certain bounds which it
may not pass, Hitherto shall thou go, and here shall thou stay thy proud waves:
Job 38.11.
by the same power also can still at his pleasure the madness and the tumult of
the people. Pilate that condemned Christ, could have had no power so to do,
Psalm. 65.7.
if it had not been given him from above. Job 19.11.
And Judas that betrayed him, and the Jews that crucified him, did no more
then what God in his determinate counsel had fore-appointed to be done. Acts
2.23.
But nor Pilate, nor Judas, nor the Jews could hinder him from rising again
from the dead. The reason was because in the eternal counsel of dye, and to
rise again: therefore God suffered them to have power to procure his Death; but
they had no power at all to hinder his Resurrection.

38. And therefore also fourthly, it will well become us, nay, it is our
bounden duty, 4. Inference
to submit to such sufferings as God shall call us to; and to take up our
cross, Luke 9.13.
when he shall think fit to lay it upon us, with all willingness. When we have
to do with Satan and his temptations, James 4.7.
resistance may be of good use to us ( Resist the devil and he will fly from
you: but when we have to do with God and his chastisements, it is in vain to
oppose. His hand is too mighty for submit, -- 10.
and to humble our selves thereunder, by acknowledging our weakness, and
resigning our wills and desires to his wisdom and goodness. It is the fondest
thing in the world to think to redeem our selves out of troubles by our own wit
or power alone, without his leave. Our own devices can no more help us, if in
his eternal counsel he have determined to afflict us: then other men's devices
can harm us, if he have determined to protect us. But how to behave our selves
when any trouble is upon us, or danger toward us; the Apostle has given us an
excellent Rule, and our Savior an excellent Example. The Rule is Phil. 4.6. Be
careful for As if he had said, Acquaint him with your griefs, what it is that
troubles you, and with your desires, what it is you would have: commend all to
his good pleasure and wisdom by your humble and hearty prayers; and then take
no further anxious care about it: your heavenly father will take care of it,
who knows better then you do, Example is, our Saviors prayer in his agony;
Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not my will,
Luke 22.42.
but thine be done. He makes his request known unto God in the former clause:
and then permits all to his will, in the later.

39. But you will say, must we sit still when trouble is upon us? Suffer all,
and do nothing? May we not cast and devise how to free our selves therefrom,
and use our best endeavors to effect it? Doubtless you may. There is nothing
meant in what has been hitherto said, to exclude either prudent counsels, or
honest endeavors. fools, or slugards. But here is the danger, lest we should
rest in our own counsels, without asking counsel at his mouth; or trust to our
own endeavors, without seeking help at his hand. We are to use both Counsels
and Endeavors, (provided ever that they be honest and lawful:) but there is
something to be done besides, both before and after. Before we use them, we
must pray unto God, that he would direct us in our Counsels, and bless us in
our Endeavors: and when we have used them, we must by our prayers again
commend the success of both to him, who is able to save us; and permit it wholly
to his wisdom goodness, at what times, and by what means, and in what measure
it will please him to save us. For so it must be, even as he will, and no
otherwise, when all is done. His Counsel shall stand: but so shall no device of
man, that agrees not thereunto.

40. That therefore we may give unto our purposes as great a certainty of good
success, as such uncertain things are capable of: it should be our care in the
last place, 5. Inference.
to provide that they may be as conformable to his Counsels, as possible may
be. Now since the Eternal Counsel of God, which is nothing else but his secret
will (though it be properly the Counsel meant in the Text,) yet is not proper
the rule or measure of our actions: we are not bound to conform our wills and
purposes thereunto; nor consequently to trouble our selves thereabouts.
Secretum meum mihi. When we are called to be of his Counsel, but not before, we
may look into the ark of his decrees, and enquire into his secret will. But
till then (which will never be) it is happiness enough for us, and an
unspeakable favor from him, if we may be admitted to be of his Court (though
not of his Counsel) and thereby to have some good knowledge of his revealed
will. That is all that belongs to us: to that therefore let us hold us, as to
Rule and Standard. As it is not fit for us to search into that Counsel of his
which is locked up in the Cabinet of his secret will: so neither is it safe for
us to despise that Counsel of his, which is imparted to us in the treasury of
his revealed will. Ask we counsel at Gods mouth; consult we the Oracles of his
holy Word; let his counselors; and let our thoughts and purposes be conformed
to the Counsels and directions given us therein: and that is the most probable
way to secure the success according to our own hearts desire, and to make them
also to stand. For what more likely way can be imagined to accomplish the
secret will of God, then faithfully to endeavor the accomplishment of his
revealed will, and commit the rest to him.

41. Whereunto that you may give the better credit, take it upon the word of
three creditable witnesses. First, our Solomon Prove. 16. Commit thy works unto
the Lord: Prove. 16.3. Psalm. 37.5.
and so shall thy thoughts His father David before him in Psalm. 37. Commit thy
way unto the Lord, and put thy trust in him; and he shall bring it to pass. And
Eliphaz the Temanite long before them both, in Job 22. If thou return unto the
Almighty, and make thy prayer unto him, etc. Job. 22.23, 28.
Thou shall also decree a thing, and it shall be established; and the light
shall shine upon thy ways.

42. If any man unto such evidence of Reason, and pregnant Testimonies shall
oppose common Experience; against which there is no disputing; That thousands
of men that have harkened to the Counsels of God in his holy word, made their
requests known to him Prayer, and committed their ways to him by a holy
dependence upon his good providence; have yet failed in their hopes, and the
success of their affairs, and fallen under their enemies hands. All this must
be confessed a truth: yet no contradiction to what has been delivered. For it
was not said, that such thoughts and purposes shall infallibly have the desired
success: but that it is the most probable way for the obtaining thereof, amidst
the great uncertainty of all humane affairs and devices. Many times there may
some sinister respects and corrupt affections mingle with our best intentions,
or devotions: or there may lurk in our hearts some secret noisome
undiscovered, and so unsubdued: or there may be a leaning too much upon our own
devices, or other inferior helps, without casting our selves upon the
providence of God so entirely as we ought: some thing or other there may be in
us, or in our purposes, or in our Prayers amiss, though perhaps we perceive it
not; for which it may please God to suffer our hopes to perish, and to render
our endeavors unsuccessfull.

43. But howsoever, two other considerations there are, that will fully answer
the Objection, and remove all difficulties in this point. First, that all
temporal promises are to be understood cum exceptione crucis: that is to say,
not absolutely according to the tenor of the expedient to deal with his
servants, either in Mercy or Justice, according to the present temper of their
hearts, and in order to their future good. So that still there is a reservation
of a power in him to exercise them with the cross, as he shall think good. In
that large promise which our blessed Savior makes to for his sake and the
Gospels; Mark 10.29, 30.
eternal life in the world to come is promised absolutely, but the hundred fold
now in this present life not simply, but with persecutions expressly annexed
Mark 10.

44. Secondly, that the desires and hopes of godly men that are agreeable to
Gods holy word, though they may for the reasons now specified, fail, as to the
particulars desired in these inferior things, which are of smaller importance,
and concern a Christian but upon the by: yet in that which ought to be, and in
every true Christian is, the main of his desires, and the ultimate end that he
looks at, so that he desires all other things but respectively and in order
to the glory of God, and the fruition of his favor; unless the fault be in
himself, he shall not fail his expectation.

45. Hear then the sum of all, and the conclusion of the whole matter. Give up
thy self faithfully to follow the good counsel of God in his revealed will: and
then give up thy desires entirely, to be disposed by his wise counsel in his
secret will: and he shall undoubtedly give thee thy hearts desire. Either in
those very particulars thou cravest at his hands, if he see the same expedient
for thee in order to his glory and thy good: or else in some other thing, which
is in truth much more expedient, for thee, then that which thou cravest, Aut
quod volumus, aut quod malumus: one of both we may be sure of. If we submit our
wills to his, both in doing and suffering; doubtless we cannot finally
miscarry. He will consult nothing but for our good: and what he has consulted
must stand.

The Author to the Reader.
BY reason of my great distance from the Press, and the flow returns of Papers
to and fro, it could not be avoided (without making more stops in the work then
was meet) but that many more mistakes must needs escape both the Printers and
Correctors observation, then would have done mine had I been nearer, who am
best acquainted with mine own hand, and best know mine own mind. Although, to
do them both right, I must acknowledge they have used good care and diligence
in doing their part. The number of Sermons in the Titles of the pages, and
likewise the Texts are sometimes mistaken; slips also there are in point of
Orthography or mis-accenting here and there, as Dissentions, Senecdoche etc.
Which I desire the Reader of himself to pardon and correct. Those that either
do alter, or might obscure the sense, (though the mistake seem but small, as
the exchange or omission but of a letter or syllable) so far as in the perusal
of the sheets I could observe them, are here presented.
