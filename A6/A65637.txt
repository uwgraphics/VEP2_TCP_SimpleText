THE Whigs Address TO His MAJESTY.
May it please Your MAJESTY,
WE who were never yet at quiet,
Lovers of CHANGE, DISORDER, RIOT,
Old Sticklers for a COMMONWEALTH,
(If you believe us) wish you Health,
A long, a safe, a prosperous Reign;
(The wicked Tories think we feign:)
We who all Monarchy despise,
Hope to find Favor in your Eyes;
Think you a Protestant so hearty
As not to Disoblige our PARTY,
And humbly beg at any Rate
To be CHIEF MINISTERS OF STATE,
Or else your Person we shall hate:
For though Religion bears the name,
It Is GOVERNMENT is all our Aim.
We'll be as Faithful and as Just
As to your Uncle, Charles the First:
Grant this Request, your Cause we'll own,
And ease the Burden of the Crown;
Make it the Easiest ever was worn,
You Will scarcely know you have any on.
But if (Great SIR,) we find you slight us,
Our selves can tell which way to Right us;
And let you know, by fad Disasters,
Though you are Lord, yet we are Masters.
This Truth you cannot choose but know,
We proved it sixty Years ago;
Yet shall you find us now on Trial,
Your faithful Subjects, OR WE LIE ALL.
LONDON, Printed by R. Ward, in the Strand.
