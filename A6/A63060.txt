The ARIELS Songs in the Play called the TEMPEST.
^ COme unto these yellow Sands, and there take hands; Curtsy'd when you have
and Kissed the wild Waves whist: ^ ^ Foot it gently here and there, and sweet
Spirits the burden bear: Hark! hark! bough wough, the watch Dogs ^ ^ Bark,
bough wough: Hark! hark! I hear the strain of strutting Chanticleer, cry
Cock-a-doodle-do. ^

Mr. Banister.
^ DRy those Eyes which are o're-flowing, all your Storms are over-blowing;
while you in this ^ ^ Isle are biding, you shall feast without providing: Every
Dainty you can think of, every Wine which ^ ^ you would drink of, shall be
yours; all want shall shun you, Ceres blessing so light on you. ^

Mr. Banister.
