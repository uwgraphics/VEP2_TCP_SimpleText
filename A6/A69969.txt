EIKON ASILIK.
1. Upon His Majesty's calling this last Parliament.
THis last Parliament I called not more by others advice, and necessity of My
affairs, then by my own choice and inclination; who have always thought the
right way of Parliaments most ^afe for my Crown, and best pleasing to My
People: And although I was not forgetful of those sparks, which some men's
distempers for^erly studied to kindle in Parliaments, (which ^y forbearing to
convene for some years, I ^oped to have extinguished) yet resolving with ^y
self to give all just satisfaction to modest and sober desires, and to
redress all pub^que greivances in Church and State: I hoped ^y My [freedome
and their moderation] to pre^ent all misunderstandings, and miscariages in ^is;
In which, as I feared affairs would meet ^ith some passion and prejudice in
other men, ^o I resolved they should find least of them in ^y self; not
doubting but by the weight of Reason I should counterpoise the over-ballancings
of any factions.

I was, indeed, sorry to hear, with what partiality and popular heat Elections
were carried in many places; yet hoping that the gravity and discretion of
other Gentlemen would allay and fix the Commons to a due temperament, (guiding
some men's wel-meaning zeal by such rules of moderation as are best, both to
preserve and restore the health of all States and Kingdoms) No man was better
pleased with the convening of this Parliament, then My self; who knowing best
the largeness of My own Heart toward My peoples good and just contentment
pleased my self most in that good and firm^ understanding, which would hence
grow between Me and My people.

All Jealousies being laid aside, My own an^ my Children Interests gave me
many obligations to seek and preserve the love and welfare o^ my Subjects. The
only temporal blessing tha^ is left to the ambition of just Monarchs, as their
greatest honor and safety, next Gods protection; I cared not to lessen my self
in some thing of my wonted prerogative; since I knew I could be no loser, if I
might gain but a recompen^ in My Subjects affections.

I intended not only to obliege My Friends, b^ Mine Enemies also: exceeding
even the desire of those, that were factiously discontented, ^ they did but
pretend to any modest and sobe^ sense.

The odium and offenses which some men's rigor or remissness in Church and
State had contracted upon my Government, I resolved to have expiated by such
Laws, and regulations for the future, as might not only rectify what was
amiss in practice, but supply what was defective in the constitution: No man
having a greater zeal to see Religion settled in Unity, and Order, than My
self; whom it most concerns both in piety, and policy; as knowing that no
flames of civil dissentions are more dangerous then those which make Religious
pretensions the grounds of Factions.

I resolved to reform, what I should by free and full advice in Parliament be
convinced to be amiss, and to grant whatever My Reason and Conscience told me
was fit to be desired; I wish I had kept my self within those bounds, and not
suffered My own Judgment to have been overborn in some things, more by others
Importunities, then their Arguments; My confidence had less betrayed My self,
and My Kingdoms to those advantages which some men sought for, who wanted
nothing but power and occasion to do mischief.

But our sins being ripe, there was no preventing of Gods Justice, from
reaping that glory in our Calamities, which we robbed him of in our Prosperity.

For thou (O Lord) have made us see, that Resolutions of future Reforming do
not always satisfy thy Justice, nor prevent thy vengeance for former
miscarriages.

Our sins have over laid our hopes, Thou have taught us to depend on thy
mercies to forgive, not on our purpose to amend. When thou have vindicated thy
glory by thy Judgment, and have showed us how unsafe it is to offend thee upon
presumptions afterward to please thee; Then I trust thy mercies will restore
those blessings to us, which we have so much abused, as to force thee to
deprive us of them.

For want of timely repentance of our sins, thou give us cause to repent of
those Remedies we too late apply.

Yet I do not Repent of my calling this last Parliament, because [O Lord,] I
did it with an upright intention to Thy glory, and My Peoples good.

The miseries which have ensued upon Me and My Kingdoms, are the just effects
of thy displeasure upon us; and may be yet (through thy mercy) preparatives of
us to future blessings, and better hearts to enjoy them.

O Lord, though thou have deprived us of many former comsorts; yet grant Me and
my People the benefit of our afflictions, and thy chastisements, that thy rod
as well as thy Staff may comfort us: Then shall we dare to account them the
strokes not of an Enemy but, a Father, when thou give us those humble
affections, that measure of patience in repentance, which becoms thy Children;
I shall have no cause to repent the miseries this Parliament has occasioned,
when by them thou have brought Me and My People, unfeignedly to repent of the
sins we have committed.

Thy Grace is infinitely better with our sufferings then our peace could be
with our sins. O thou Sovereign goodness and wisdom who over-rulest all our
Counsels, over rules also all our hearts, that the worse things we suffer by
thy justice, the better we may be by thy Mercy.

As our sins have turned our Antidotes into poison, so let thy grace turn our
poisons into Antidotes.

As the sins of our peace disposed us to this unhappy war, so let this War
prepare us for thy blessed Peace.

That although I have but troublesome Kingdoms here, yet I may attain to that
kingdom of peace in My Heart, and in thy Heaven, which Christ has purchased,
and thou will give to thy servant, [though a Sinner] for my Saviors sake.

Amen.
2: Upon the Earl of Straffords death.
I Looked upon my Lord of Strafford, as a Gentleman, whose great abilities
might make a Prince rather afraid, then ashamed to employ him in the greatest
affairs of State.

For, those were prone to create in him great confidence of undertakings, and
this was like enough to betray him to great errors, and many Enemies; whereof
he could not but contract good store, while moving in so high a sphere, and
with so vigorous a luster, he must need, [as the sun] raise many envious
exhalations, which condensed by a popular Odium, were capable to cast a cloud
upon the brightest merit and integrity.

Though I cannot in my judgment approve all he did, driven (it may be) by the
necessities of times, and the Temper of that people, more then led by his own
disposition to any height and rigor of actions, yet I could never be convinced
of any such criminousnesse in him, as willingly to expose his life to the
stroke of Justice, and malice of his Enemies.

I never met with more unhappy conjuncture of affairs, then in the business
of that unfortunate Earl: when between My own unsatisfiednesse in Conscience,
and a necessity (as some told me) of satisfying the importunities of some
people, I was persuaded by those, that I think wished me well, to choose rather
what was safe, then what seemed just; preferring the outward peace of My
Kingdoms with men, before that inward exactness of Conscience before God.

And indeed, I am so far from excusing or denying that compliance on my part
(for plenary consent it was not) to his destruction, whom in my judgment I
thought not, by any clear Law, gilty of death; That I never bare any touch of
Conscience with greater regret: which, as a sign of my repentance, I have often
with sorrow confessed both to God and men, as an act of so sinful frailty,
that it discovered more a fear of Man, than of God, whose name and place on
Earth no man is worthy to bear, who will avoid inconveniences of State, by acts
of so high injustice, as no public convenience can expiate or compensate.

I see it a bad exchange to wound a man's own Conscience, thereby to salve State
sores; to calm the storms of popular discontents, by stirring up a tempest in
a man's own bosom.

Nor has Gods justice failed in the event and sad consequences, to show the
world the falacy of that Maxim, Better one man perish (though uniustly) then
the people be displeased, or destroyed.

For, In all likelihood I could never have suffered with My People greater
calamities (yet with greater comfort) had I vindicated Strafford s innocence,
at least by denying to sign that destructive Bill, according to that justice,
which my Conscience suggested, to me, then I have done since I gratified some
men's unthankful importunities with so cruel a favor. And I have observed,
that those, who counseled me to sign that Bill, have been so far from
receiving the rewards of such ingratiatings with the people, that no men have
bin harassed and crushed more than they: He only has bin least vexed by them,
who counseled me not to consent against the vote of my own Conscience, I hope
God has forgiven me and them the sinful rashness of that business.

To which being in my Soul so fully conscious, those judgments God has pleased
to send upon me, are so much the more welcome, as a means (I hope) which his
mercy has sanctified so to me, as to make me repent of that unjust act, (for
so it was to me) and for the future to teach me, That the best rule of policy
is to prefer the doing of Justice before all enjoyments, and the peace of my
conscience before the preservation of my Kingdoms.

Nor has any thing more fortified my ^esolutions against all those violent
importunityes, which since have sought to gain alike consent from me, to Acts,
wherein my conscience is unsatisfied, then the Sharp touches I have had for
what passed Me, in My Lord of Straffords Business.

Not that I resolved to have employed him in My affairs, against the advice of
my Parliament, but I would not have had any hand in his Death, of whose
Guiltlesnesse I was better assured than any man living could be.

Nor were the Crimes objected against him so clear, as after a long and fair
hearing, to give convincing satisfaction to the major part of both Houses;
especially that of the Lords, of whom scarce a third part were present, when
the Bill passed that House: And for the House of Commons, many Gentlemen,
disposed enough to diminish My L. of Straffords greatness and power, yet
unsatisfied of his guilt in Law, durst not condemn him to die; who for their
integrity in their Votes, were by poasting their names, exposed to the popular
calumny, hatred and fury: which grew then so exorbitant in their clamours for
Justice, [that is, to have both my self and the two Houses vote, and do as they
would have us] that many ['tis thought] were rather terrified to concur with
the condemning party, then satisfied that of right they ought so to do.

And that after Act vacating the authority of the precedent, for future
imitation, sufficiently tells the world, that some remorse touched even his
most implacable Enemies, as knowing he had very hard measure, and such as they
would be very loath should be repeated to themselves.

This tenderness and regret I find in my soul, for having had any hand [and
that very unwillingly God knows] in shedding one man's blood unjustly (though
under the color and formalities of Justice, and pretenses of avoiding public
mischiefs:) which may, I hope, be some evidence before God and Man, to all
posterity, that I am far from bearing justly the vast load and guilt of all
that blood which has been shed in this unhappy War: which some men will needs
charge on Me, to case their own souls, who am, and ever shall be more afraid
to take away any man's life unjustly, then to lose my own.

But thou, O God of infinite mercies, forgive me that act of sinful
compliance, which has greater aggravations upon Me, then any Man. Since I had
not the least temptation of envy, or malice against him, and by my place
should, at least so far; have bin a preserver of him, as to have denied my
consent to his destruction.

O Lord, I acknowledge my transgression, and my sin is ever before me.

Deliver me from bloudguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation, and my
tongue shall sing of thy righteousness.

Against thee have I finned, and done this evil in thy sight, for thou saw
the contradiction between my heart and my hand.

Yet cast me not away from thy presence, purge me with the blood of my
Redeemer, and I shall be clean; wash me with that precious efusion, and I shall
be whiter then snow.

Teach me to learn Righteousness by thy Judgments, and to see my frailty in
thy Justice: while I was persuaded by shedding one man's blood to prevent
after-troubles, thou have for that, among other sins, brought upon Me, and upon
My Kingdoms, great, long, and heavy troubles.

Make me to prefer Justice, which is thy will, before all contrary clamours,
which are but the discoveries of man's injurious will.

It is too much that they have once overcome me, to please them by displeasing
thee; O never suffer me for any Reason of State, to go against my Reason of
Conscience, which is highly to sin against thee, the God of Reason, and Judge of
our Consciences.

Whatever, O Lord, thou see fit to deprive me of, yet restore unto me the joy
of thy Salvation, and ever uphold me with thy free Spirit; which subjects my
will to none, but thy light of Reason, Justice, and Religion, which shines in
my Soul, for thou desire Truth in the inward parts, and integrity in the
outward expressions.

Lord hear the voice of thy Sons, and my Saviors Blood, which speaks better
things: O make me, and my people, to hear the voice of joy and gladness, that
the bones which thou have broken may rejoice in thy Salvation.

3 Upon His Maiestes going to the House of Commons.
MY going to the House of Commons to demand justice upon the 5. Members, was an
act, which my enemies loaded with all the obloquies and exasperations they
could.

It filled indifferent men with great jealousies and fears; yea; and many of my
friends resented it as a motion rising rather from Passion than Reason, and not
guided with such discretion as the touchines of those times required. But these
men knew not the fast motives, and pregnant grounds, with which I thought my
self so furnished, that they needed nothing to such evidence, as I could have
produced against those I charged, save only a free and legal Trial, which was
all I desired.

Nor had I any temptation of displeasure or revenge against those men's persons,
further then I had discovered those [as I thought] unlawful correspondencies
they had used, and engagements they had made to embroyle my Kingdoms; of all
which I missed but little to have produced writings under some men's own hands,
who were the chief contrivers of the following innovations.

Providence would not have it so, yet I wanted not such probabilities as were
sufficient to raise jealousies in any Kings heart, who is not wholly stupid and
neglective of the public peace, which to preserve by calling in question half
a dozen men, in a fair and legal way, (which God knows was all my design)
could have amounted to no worse effect, had it succeeded, then either to do me
and my Kingdom right, in case they had bin found guilty; or else to have
cleared their innocence, and removed my suspicions; which, as they were not
raised out of any malice, so neither were they in Reason to be smothered.

What flames of discontent this spark (though I sought by all speedy and
possible means to quench it) soon kindled, all the world is witness: The
aspersion which some men cast upon that action, as if I had designed by force
to assault the House of Commons, and invade their privilege, is so false, that
as God best knows, I had no such intent; so none that attended Me could justly
gather from any thing I then said, or did, the least intimation of any such
thoughts.

That I went attended with some Gentlemen as it was no unwonted thing for the
Majesty and safety of a King so to be attended, especially in discontented
times, so were my followers at that time short of my ordinary guard, and no way
proportionable to hazard a tumultuary conflict. Nor were they more scared at my
coming, then I was unassured of not having some affronts cast upon me, if I
had none with me to preserve a reverence to me; For many people had, [at that
time] learned to think those hard thoughts, which they have since abundantly
vented against Me, both by words and deeds.

The sum of that business was this.

Those men and their adherents were then looked upon by the afrighted vulgar as
greater Protectors of their Laws and Liberties, then my self, and so worthier
of their protection. I leave them to God, and their own Consciences, who, if
guilty of evil machinations; no present impunity, or popular vindications of
them will be subter fuge sufficient to rescue them from those exact Tribunalls.

To which, in the obstructions of justice among men, we must religiously
appeal, as being an argument to us Christians of that after unavoidable
judgment, which shall rejudge, what among men is but corruptly decided, or not
at all.

I endeavored to have prevented, if God had seen fit, those future commotions,
which I foresaw, would in all likelihood follow some men's activity [if not
restrained] and so now has don to the undoing of many thousands, the more is
the pity.

But to overawe the freedom of the Houses, or to weaken their just Authority
by any violent impressions upon them, was not at all my design: I thought I had
so much justice and reason on my side, as should not have needed so rough
assistance: and I was resolved rather to bear the repulse with patience, then
to use such hazardous extremities.

But thou O Lord art my witness in heaven, and in my Heart: if I have purposed
any violence or oppression against the innocent, or if there were any such
wickedness in my thoughts.

Then let the enemy persecute my soul, and tread my life to the ground, and
lay mine Honor in the dust.

Thou that see not as a man sees, but look beyond all popular
appearances, searching the heart, and trying the reins, and bringing to light
the hidden things of darkness, show thy self.

Let not my afflictions be esteemed, as (with wise and godly men they cannot
be) any argument of my sin in that matter, more then their impunity among
good men is any sure token of their innocence.

But forgive them wherein they have done amiss^, though they are not punished
for it in this world.

Save thy servant, from the privy conspiracies and open violence of bloody
and unreasonable men, according to the uprightnes of my heart, and the
innocence of my hands in this matter.

Plead my cause, and maintain My Right, O thou that sit in the Throne,
judging rightly, that thy Servant may ever rejoice in thy Salvation.

4 Upon the Insolency of the Tumults*
I Never thought any thing (except our sins) more ominously presaging all these
mischeifs, which have followed, then those Tumults in LONDON and WESTMINSTER,
soon after the Convening of this Parliament; which were not like a storm at
Sea, [which yet wants not its terror] but like an Earthquake, shaking the very
foundations of all; then which nothing in the world has more of horror.

As it is one of the most convincing Arguments that there is a God, while his
power sets bounds to the raging of the Seas, so it is no less, that he
restraines the madness of the people. Nor does any thing portend more Gods
displeasure against a Nation, then when he suffers the confluence and clamours
of the vulgar, to pass all boundaries of Laws, and reverence to Authority.

Which those Tumults did to so high degrees of insolence, that they spared not
to invade the Honor and Freedom of the two Houses, menacing, reproaching,
shaking, yea and assaulting some Members of both Houses, as they fancyed, or
disliked them; nor did they forbear most rude and unseemly deportments both in
contemptuous words and actions, to my self and my Court.

Nor was this a short fit or two of shaking, as an Ague, but a quotidian
fever, always increasing to higher inflammations, impatient of any mitigation,
restraint, or remission.

First, they must be a guard against those fears which some men scared
themselves and others withal, when indeed nothing was more to be feared and
less to be used by wise men, then those tumultuary confluxes of mean and rude
people, who are taught first to petition, then to protect, then to dictate, at
last to command and overawe the Parliament.

All obstructions in Parliament [that is, all freedom of differing in Votes,
and debating matters with reason and candor) must be taken away with these
Tumults: By these must the Houses be purged, and all rotten Members (as they
please to count them) cast out; By these the obstinacy of men resolved to
discharg their Consciences, must be subdued; by these all factious, seditious,
and schismatic proposalls against Government Ecclesiastical or Civil, must
be backed and abetted, till they prevailed.

Generally, who ever had most mind to bring forth confusion and ruin upon
Church and State, used the midwifery of those Tumults: whose riot and
impatience was such, that they would not stay the ripening and season of
counsels or fair production of Acts, in the order, gravity, and
deliberatenesse befitting a Parliament; but ripped up with barbarous cruelty,
and forcibly cut out abortive Votes, such as their inviters and incouragers
most fancyed.

Yea, so enormous and detestable were their outrages, that no sober man could
be without an infinite shame and sorrow to see them so tolerated, and connived
at by some, countenanced, encouraged and applauded by others.

What good man had not rather want any thing he most desired for the public
good, then obtain it by such an unlawful and irreligious means? But men's
passions and Gods direction seldom agree; violent designs and motions must
have suitable engines, such as too much attend their own ends, seldom confine
themselves to Gods means. Force must crowd in, what reason will not lead.

Who were the chief Demagogues and Patrons of Tumults, to send for them, to
flatte^ and emboulden them, to direct and turn their clamorous importunities,
some men yet living are too conscious to pretend ignorance; God in his due time
will let these see, that those were no fit means to be used for attaining his
ends.

But, as it is no strange thing for the Sea, to rage when strong winds blow
upon it, so neither for multitudes to become insolent, when they have Men of
some reputation for part^ and piety to fet them on.

That which made their rudeness most formidable, was that many Complaints
being made, and Messages sent by My self and some of both Houses; yet no order
for redress could be obtained with any vigor and efficacy, proportionable to
the malignity of that now far spread disease, and predominant mischief.

Such was some men's stupidity, that they feared no inconvenience: Others
petulancy, that they joyed to see their betters shamefully outraged and abused,
while they knew their only security consisted in vulgar flattery: So insensible
were they of mine, or the two Houses common safety and honors.

Nor could ever any order be obtained, impartially to examine, censure, and
punish the know^ Boutefeus, and impudent Incendiaries, who boasted of the
influence they had, and used to convoke those Tumults as their advantages
served.

Yea, some (who should have bin wiser Statesmen) owned them as friends,
commending their Courage, Zeal, and industry; which to sober men could seem no
better then that of the Devil, who goes about seeking whom he may deceive and
devour.

I confess when I found such a deafnes, that no Declaration from the Bishops,
who were first foully insolenced and assaulted; nor yet from other Lords and
Gentlemen of Honor, nor yet from my self, could take place for the due
repression of these Tnmults: and securing not only Our freedom in Parliament,
but Our very Persons in the streets; I thought My self not bound by My
presence, to provoke them to higher boldness and contempts; I hoped by My
withdrawing to give time, both for the Ebbing of their tumultuous fury, and
others regaining some degrees of modesty and sober sense.

Some may interpret it as an effect of Pusillanimity in any man for popular
terrors to desert his public station. But I think it a hardiness beyond
true valor, for a wise man to set him self against the breaking in of a Sea;
which to resist, at present, threatens imminent danger; but to withdraw, gives
it space to spend its fury, and gains a fitter time to repair the breach*
Certainly a Gallant man had rather sight to great disadvantages for number and
place in the sield, in an orderly way, then skuffle with an undisciplined
rabble.

Some suspected and affirmed that I meditated a War (when I went from
Whitehall, only to redeem My Person and Conscience from violence) God knows I
did not then think of a War.

Nor will any prudent man conceive that ^ would by so many former, and some
after-acts* have so much weakened my self, if I had purposed to engage in a War,
which to decline by all means, I denied My self in so many particulars* It Is
evident I had then no Army to fly unto, for protection, or vindication.

Who can blame Me, or any other, for withdrawing our selves from the daily
baitings o^ the Tumults, not knowing whether their fur^ and discontent might
not fly so high, as to worry and tear those in pieces, whom as yet they bu^
played with in their Paws? God, who is M^ sole Judge, is My Witness in Heaven,
that I never had any thoughts of going from My House at Whitehall, if I could
have had but any reasonable fair Quarter; I was resolved to bear much and did
so, but I did not think My self bound t^ prostitute the Majesty of my place and
Person the safety of My Wife and Children, to those who are prone to insult
most, when they have objects and opportunity most capable of the^ rudeness and
petulancy.

But this business of the Tumults (whereof some have given already an account
to God, others, yet living know themselves desperately guilty) Time and the
guilt of many has so smothered up, and buried, that I think it best to leave
it, as it is. Only I believe the just Avenger of al disorders, will in time
make those men, and that City, see their sin in the glass of their punishment.
It Is more then an even-lay that they may one day see themselves punished by
that way they offended.

Had this Parliament, as it was in its first Election and constitution, sat
full and free, the Members of both houses being left to their freedom of
Voting, as in all reason, honor, and Religion, they should have bin; I doubt
not but things would have bin so carried, as would have given no less content
to all good men, then they wished or expected.

For I was resolved to hear reason in all things, and to consent to it so far
as I could comprehend it: but as Swine are to Gardens, and orderly Plantations,
so are Tumults to Parliaments, and Plebeian concourses to public Councels,
turning all into disorders and sordid confusions.

I am prone sometimes to think, that had I called this Parliament to any other
place in England (as I might opportunly enough have don) the sad consequences
in all likelihood, with Gods blessing might have been prevented.

A Parliament would have bin welcome in any place, no place afforded such
confluence of various and vicious humors, as that where it was unhappily
convened. But we must leave all to God, who orders our disorders, and magnifies
his wisdom most, when our follies and miseries are most discovered.

But thou O Lord art My refuge and defense, to thee J may safely fly, who
rulest the raging of the Sea, and the madness of the People.

The floods, O Lord, the floods are come in upon me, and are ready to
overwhelme me.

J look upon My sins, and the sins of My people, (which are the tumults of
our souls against thee O Lord) as the just cause of these popular inundations
which thou permittest to overbeare all the banks of loyalty, modesty, Laws,
Justice, and Religion.

But thou that gatheredst the waters into one place* and made the dry land to
appear, and after did'^ assuage the flood which drowned the world, by the word
of thy power: Rebuke those beasts of the People* and deliver Me from the
rudeness and striving^ of the multitude.

Restore, we beseech thee unto us, the freedoms o^ our Counsels, and
Parliaments, make us unpassi^na^ly to see the light of reason, and Religion,
an^ wi^h all order and gravitie to follow it, as it becom^ Men and Christians,
so shall we praise thy name who art the God of Order and Council.

What man cannot, or will not repress, thy ^mnip^tent Justice can and will.

O Lord, give them that are yet living a timely s^^ce and sorrow for their
great si^ne, whom thou know guilty of raising or not suppressing those
disorders: Let shame here, and not suffering hereafter be their punishment.

Set bounds to our passions by Reason, to our error by Truth, to our seditions
by laws duly executed, and to our schisms, by Charity, that we may b^ as thy
Jerusalem, a City at unity in it self.

This grant, O My God, in thy good time for Jesus Christ's sake

Amen.
5 Upon his Majesty's passing the bill for Trieniall Parliaments, and after,
settling this, during the pleasure of the two houses.
THat the world might be fully confirmed in My purposes at first, to contribute
what in Justice, Reason, Honor, and Conscience I could, to the happy success
of this Parliament (which had in me no other design but the general Good of
My Kingdoms) I willingly passed the Bill for Trieniall Parliaments; which, as
gentle and seasonabl^ Physic, might (if well applied) prevent any distempers
from getting any head, or prevailing; especially, if the remedy proved not a
desease beyond all remedy.

I conceived this Parliament would sind work with convenient Recesses for the
first 3. years; But I did not imagine that some Men would thereby have
occasioned more work then they found to do, by undoing so much as they found
well don to their hands.

Such is some men's activity, that they will needs make work rather then want
it; and choose to be doing amiss, rather then do nothing.

When that first Act seemed too scanty to satisfy some men's fears, and compass
public affairs; I was persuaded to grant that BILL of Sitting during the
pleasure of the Houses, which amounted, in some men's sense, to as much as the
perpetuating of this Parliament. By this Act of highest confidence, I hoped for
ever to shut out, and lock the door upon all present jealousies, and future
mistakes. I confess I did not thereby intend to shut My self out of doors,
as some men have now requited Me.

True, it was an Act unparalled by any of My Predecessors; yet cannot in
reason admit of any worse interpretation then this, of an extreme confidence I
had, That my Subjects would not make ill use of an Act, by which I declared so
much to trust them, as to deny my self in so high a point of my Prerogative.

For, good Subjects will never think it just or fit that my condition should be
worse by my bettering theirs* Nor indeed would it have been so in the events,
if some men had known as well with moderation to use, as with earnestnes to
defire advantages of doing good or evil.

A continual Parliament (I thought) would but keep the commonweal in tune, by
preserving Laws in their due execution and vigor; wherein my Interest lies
more then any man's, since by those Laws, My Rights as a King, would be
preserved no less then My Subjects, which is al I desired. More then the Law
gives Me I would not have, and less the meanest Subject should not.

Some (as I have heard) gave it out, that I soon repented Me of settling that
act; and many would needs persuade Me, I had cause so to do; But I could not
easily nor sudenly suspect such ingratitude in Men of Honor. That the more I
granted them, the less I should have and enjoy with them. I still counted my
Self undiminished by my largest Concessions, if by them I might gain and
confirm the love of my people.

Of which, I do not yet despair, but that God will still bless me with
increase of it, when men shall have more leisure, and less prejudice; that so
with unpassionate representations they may reflect upon those (as I think) not
more Princely then freindly Contributions, which I granted toward the
perpetuating of their happiness; who are now only miserable in this, That some
men's ambition will not give them leave to enjoy what I intended for their good.

Nor do I doubt, but that in Gods due time, the Loyal and cleared affections
of My people, will strive to return such retributions of Honor and love to
Me, or my posterity, as may fully compensate both the acts of my confidence
and my sufferings for them; which (God knows) have been neither few, nor
small, nor short; occasioned chiefly by a persuasion I had, that I could not
grant too much, or distrust too little, to men, that being professedly My
Subjects, pretended singular piety, and religious strictness.

The Injury of all Injuries, is, That which some men will needs load me
withal; as if I were a wilful and resolved Occasioner of My own, and My
Subjects miseries, while (as they confidently, but (God knows) falsely divulge)
I repini^g at the establishment of this Parliament, endeavored by force and
open hostility, to undo what by My Royal assent I had done. Sure it had
argued a very short sight of things, and extreme fatuity of mind in Me, so
far to bind My own hands at their request, If I had shortly meant to have
used a Sword against them. God knows, though I had then a sense of injuries;
yet not such as to think them worth vindicating by a War: I was not then
compelled, as since, to injure my self by their not using favors, with the
same candor wherewith they were conferred. The Tumults indeed threatened to
abuse all Acts of Grace, and turn them into wantonness; but I thought at
length their own fears, whose black arts first raised up those turbulent
Spirits, would force them to conjure them down again.

Nor if I had justly resented any indignities put upon Me, or others; was I
then in any capacity to have taken just revenge in an Hostile and Warlike way,
upon those whom I knew so well fortified in the love of the meaner sort of the
people, that I could not have given my enemies greater and more desired
advantages against Me, then by so unprincely inconstancy, to have assaulted
them with Arms, thereby to scatter them, whom but lately I had solemly settled
by an Act of Parliament.

God knows, I longed for nothing more then that My self, and My Subjects might
quietly enjoy the fruits of my many condescendings.

It had been a Course full of sin, as well as of Hazard, and Dishonor, for me
to go about the cutting up of that by the Sword, which I had so lately planted,
so much (as I thought) to my Subjects content, and Mine own too, in all
probability: if some men had not feared where no fear was, whose security
consisted in scaring others.

I thank God, I knew so well the sincerity and uprightness of My own heart,
in passing that great Bill, which exceeded the very thoughts of former times;
That although I may se^m less a Politition to men, yet I need no secret
distinctions or evasions before God Nor had I any reservations in my own soul,
when I passed it; nor repentings after, till I saw that my letting some men go
up to the pinnacle of the temple, was a temptation to them to cast me down
headlong.

Concluding, that without a miracle, Monarchy it self, together with Me, could
not but be dashed in pieces by such a precipitious fall as they intended, whom
God in mercy forgive, and make them see at length, That as many Kingdoms as
the Devil showed our Savior, and the glory of them) if they could be at once
enjoyed by them] are not worth the gaining, by ways of sinful ingratitude and
dishonor, which hazards a Soul worth more worlds, then this has Kingdoms.

But God has hitherto preserved Me, and made Me to see, That it is no strange
thing for men, left to their own passions, either to do much evil themselves,
or abuse the overmuch goodness of others, whereof an ungrateful surfeit is the
most desperate and incurable disease,

I cannot say properly that I repent of that Act, since I have no reflections
upon it as a sin of my will, though an error of too charitable a judgment;
only I am sorry other men's eyes should be evil, because mine were good.

To thee (O My God) do I still appeal, whose Aldis^erning Justice sees through
all the disguises of men's pre^ensions, and deceitful darknesses, of their
Hearts.

Thou gave Me a heart to grant much to my subjects, and now I need a heart
fitted to suffer much from some of them.

Thy will be don, though never so much to the crossing of ours, even when we
hope to do what might be most conformable to thine and theirs too; who
pretended they aimed at nothing else.

Let thy Grace teach me wisely to enjoy as w^ll the frustratings, as the
fulfillings of My best hopes, and most specious desires:

I see while I thought to allay others fears; I have raised My Own; and by
settling them, have unsettled My self.

Thus have they requited Me evil for good, and hatred for My good will toward
them.

O Lord be thou my Pilot in this dark and dangerous storm, which neither
admits My return to the Port whence I set out, nor My making any other, with
that safety and honor which I designed.

It Is easy for thee to keep Me safe in the love and confidence of my people;
nor is it hard for Thee to preserve Me amidst the unjust hatred and iealousies
of to many, which thou have suffered so far to prevail upon Me, as to be able
to pervert and abuse my Acts of greatest Indulgence to them, and assurance of
them.

But no favors from Me can make others more guilty then my self may be, of
misusing those many and great ones, which Thou, O Lord, have conferred on me.

I beseech thee give ME and them such Repentance as thou will accept, and such
graces as we may not abuse.

Make me so far happy as to make a right use of others abuses, and by their
failings of Me, to reflect with a reforming displeasure upon my offenses
against thee.

So, although for my sins I am by other men's sins deprived of thy temporal
blessings, yet I may be happy to enjoy the comfort of thy mercies, which often
raise ^he greatest Sufferers to be the most glorious Saints.

6 Upon his Majesty's retirement from Westminster,
WIth what unwillingnesse I withdrew from WESTMINSTER, let them judge, who,
unprovided of tackling and victual, are forced to Sea by a storm; yet better
do so, then venture splitting or sinking on a Lee-shore.

I stayed at White Hall, till I was driven away by shame, more then fear, to
see the barbarous rudeness of those Tumults, who resolved they would take the
boldness to demand any thing, and not leave either My self, or the Members of
Parliament, the liberty of our Reason, and Conscience to deny them any thing.

Nor was this intolerable oppression my case alone, (though chiefly Mine) For
the Lords and Commons might be content to be over-voted by the Major part of
their Houses, when they had used each their own freedom.

Whose agreeing Votes were not by any Law or reason conclusive to my Judgment;
nor can they include, or carry with them, My consent, whom they represent not
in any kind; Nor am I further bound to agree with the votes of both Houses,
then I see them agree with the will of God, with my just Rights, as a King, and
the general good of my people. I see that as many men; they are seldom of one
mind, and I may often see, that the major part of them are not in the right.

I had formerly declared to sober and moderate minds, how desirous I was to
give all just content, when I agreed to so many Bills, which had been enough to
secure and satisfy all: If some men's Hydropick insatiablenesse had not learned
to thirst the more by how much more they drank; whom no fountain of Royal
bounty was able to overcome: so resolved they seemed, either utterly to exhaust
it, or barbarously to obstruct it.

Sure, it ceases to be Council: when not reason is used, as to men to
persuade; but force and terror as to beasts, to drive and compel men to
assent to what ever tumultuary patrons shall project. He deserves to be a
slave without pity, or redemption, that is content to have the rational
sovereignty of his Soul, and liberty of his will, and words so captivated.

Nor do I think my Kingdoms so considerable as to preserve them with the
forfeiture of that freedom, which cannot be denied me as a King; because it
belongs, to me as a man, and a Christian, owning the dictates of none, but God
to be above me, as obliging me to consent. Better for me to die, enjoying this
Empire of my soul, which subjects Me only to God, so far as by Reason or
Religion he directs me, then live with the Title of a King, if it should carry
such a vassallage with it, as not to suffer Me to use My Reason and Conscience,
in which I declare as a King, to like or dislike.

So far am I from thinking the Majesty of the Crown of England to be bound by
any Coronation Oath, in a blind and brutish formality, to consent to what ever
its subjects in Parliament shall require; as some men will needs infer; while
denying Me any power of a Negative voice as KING, they are not ashamed to seek
to deprive me of the liberty of using My Reason with a good Conscience; which
themselves, and all the Commons of ENGLAND enjoy proportionable to their
influence on the public; who would take it very ill to be urged, not to deny,
what ever my self, as King, or the House of Peers with Me should, not so much
desire, as enjoyne them to pass. I think my Oath fully discharged in that
point, by my governing only by such Laws, as my People with the House of Peers
have chosen, and my self have consented to. I shall never think my self
conscientiously tied to go as often against my Conscience, as I should consent to
such new Proposalls, which my Reason, in Justice, Honor, and Religion bids me
deny.

Yet so tender I see some men are of their being subject to Arbitrary
Government, (that is, the Law of another will, to which themselves give no
consent) that they care not wi h how much dishonor and absurdity they make
their King the only man, that must be subject to the will of others, without
having power left Him, to use His own Reason, either in Person, or by any
Representation.

And if my dissentings at any time were (as some have suspected, and
uncharitably avowed) out of error, opiniativenesse, weakness, or wilfulness,
and what they call Obstinacy in me (which not true Judgment of things, but
some vehement prejudice or passion has fixed on my mind) yet can no man think
it other then the Badge and Method of Slavery, by savage rudeness, and
importunate obtrusions of violence, to have the mist of His Error and Passion
dispelled, which is a shadow of Reason, and must serve those that are destitute
of the substance* Sure that man cannot be blameable to God or Man, who
seriously endeavors to see the best reason of things, and faithfully follows
what He takes for Reason:

The uprightness of his intentions will excuse the possible failings of his
understanding; If a Pilot at Sea cannot see the Pole Star, it can be no fault
in him to steer his course by such sta^ as do best appear to him. It argues
rather thos^ men to be conscious of their defects of Reason and convincing
Arguments, who call in the assistance of mere force to carry on the weakness
of their Counsels, and Proposalls. I may, in the Truth and Uprightness of my
heart, protest before God and men, that I never wilfully opposed, or denied any
thing, that was in a fai^ way, after full and free debates propounded to me by
the two Houses, Further then I thought in good reason I might, and was bound to
do*

Nor did any thing ever please me more, the^ when my judgment so concurred
with theirs* that I might with good conscience consent to them: yea, in many
things where not absolut^ and moral necessity of Reason but temporary
convenience in point of honor was to be considered; I chose rather to deny my
self, the^ them; as preferring that which they thought necessary for my
peoples good, before what I saw but convenient for my self.

For I can be content to recede much from my own interests, and Personal
Rights, of which I conceive my self to be Master; but in wha^ concerns Truth,
Justice, the Right of the Church, and My Crown, together with the general
good of My Kingdoms: (all which I am bound to preserve as much as morally lies
in Me,) here I am, and ever shall be fixed and resolute, nor shall any man gain
My consent to that, wherein My Heart gives My tongue or hand the Lie; nor will
I be brought to affirm that to men, which in My Conscience I deny before God.
I will rather choose to wear a Crown of Thorns with My Savior, then to exchange
that of Gold (which is due to me) for one of lead, whose embassed flexiblenesse
shall be forced to bend, and comply to the various, and often contrary dictates
of any Factions; when instead of Reason, and Public concernments, they obtrude
nothing but what makes for the interest of Parties, and flows from the
partialities of private wills, and passions.

I know no resolutions more worthy a Christian King, then to prefer His
Conscience before His Kingdoms.

O my God, preserve thy servant in this Native, Rational and Religious
freedom; For this I believe is thy will, that we should maintain: who, though
thou do justly require us, to submit our understandings and wills to thine;
whose wisdom and goodness can neither err, nor misguide us; and so far to
deny our carnal reason, in order to thy sacred mysteries, and Commands, that
we should believe and obey, rather then dispute them; yet do thou expect from
us, only such a reasonable service of thee, as not to do any thing for thee,
against our consciences, and as to the desires of men, enioynest us to try all
things by the touchstone of Reason and Laws, which are the rules of Civil
Justice; and to declare our consent to that only which our Judgment approve.

Thou know, O Lord, how unwilling I was to desert that place, in which thou
have set me, and whereto the affairs of my Kingdoms at present did call me.

My People can witness how far I have bin content for their good, to deny My
Self, in what thou have subjected to my disposal.

O Let not the unthankful importunities, and tumultuary violence of some men's
immoderate demands, ever betray Me to that degenerous and unmanly slavery,
which should make me strengthen them by my consent in those things, which I
think in my Conscience to be against thy glory the good of my Subjects, and the
discharge of my own duty to reason and Justice.

Make me willing to suffer the greatest indignities, and injuries they press
upon Me, rather then commit the least sin against my Conscience.

Let the just liberties of my people be (as well they may) preserved in fair,
and equal ways, without the slavery of My Soul.

Thou that have invested Me by thy favors, in the power of a Christian King,
suffer me not to subject My Reason to other men's passions, and designs, which
to Me seem unreasonable, unjust, and irreligious: So shall I serve thee in the
truth and uprightnesle of my heart, though I cannot satisfy these men.

Though I be driven from among them, yet give Me grace to walk always
uprightly before thee.

Lead Me in the way of Truth and Justice; for these, I know, will bring Me at
last to peace and happiness with thee; though for these I have much trouble
among men.

This I beg of thee for My Saviors sake.

7 Upon the Queens departure, and absence out of England,
ALthough I have much cause to be troubled at My Wifes departure from Me, and
out of My Dominions; yet not Her absence, so much, as the scandal of that
necessity, which drives her away, does afflict Me. That She should be compelled
by My own Subjects, and those pretending to be Protestants, to withdraw for Her
safety: This being the first example of any Protestant Subjects, that have
taken up Arms against their King, a Protestant: For I look upon this now done
in England, as another Act of the same Tragedy which was lately begun in
Sootland; the brands of that fire being ill quenched, have kindled the like
flames here. I fear such motions (so little to the adorning of the Protestant
profession, may occasion a farther alienation of mind, and divorce of
affections in her from that religion, which is the only thing wherein we differ.
Which yet God can, and I pray he would in time take away, and not suffer these
practices to be any obstruction to her judgment; since it is the motion of
those men (for the most part) who are yet to seek and settle their Religion for
Doctrine, Government, and good manners, and so not to be imputed to the true
English Protestants; who continue firm to their former settled Principles and
Laws.

I am sorry My relation to so deserving a Lady, should be any occasion of her
danger and affliction; whose merits would have served her for a protection
among the savage Indians; while their rudeness and barbarity knows not so
perfectly to hate all Virtues, as some men's subtilty does; among whom I yet
think few are so malicious as to hate Her for Her self. The fault is, that She
is my Wife.

All justice then as well as affection commands me, to study her security, who
is only in danger for my sake: I am content to be tossed, weatherbeaten, and
shipwrackt, so as she may be in safe* Harbor. This comfort I shall enjoy by
her safety in the midst of My Personal dangers, that I can perish but half, if
she be preserved: In whose memory, and hopeful Posterity, I may yet survive
the malice of my enemies, although they should be satiated with my blood.

I must leave Her, and them to the love and loyalty of my good subjects; and to
his protection, who is able to punish the faults of Princes, and no less
severely to reveng the injuries done to Them, by those, who, in all duty and
Allegiance, ought to have made good that safety, which the Laws chiefly
provide for Princes.

But common civility is in vain expected from those, that dispute their
Loyalty: Nor can it be safe for any relation to a King, to tarry among them who
are shaking hands with their Allegiance, under pretense of laying faster hold
on their Religion.

It Is pity so noble and peaceful a soul should see, much more suffer, the
rudeness of those who must make up their want of justice, with inhumanity, and
impudence.

Her sympathy with Me in My afflictions, will make her virtues shine with
greater luster, as stars in the dark st nights; and assure the envious world,
that she loves me, not my fortunes.

Neither of us but can easily forgive, since we do not much blame the
unkindnesse of the Generality, and Vulgar; for we see God is pleased to try
both our patience, by the most self-punishing sin, the Ingratitude of those,
who having eaten of our bread, and being enriched with Our bounty, have
Scornfully lift up themselves against Us; and those of Our own Household are
become Our Enemies.

I pray God lay not their sin to their charge; who think to satisfy all
obligations to duty, by their Corban of Religion; and can less endure to see,
then to sin against their benefactours, as well as their Sovereigns.

But even that policy of my Enemies is so far venial, as it was necessary to
their designs, by scandalous Articles, and all irreverent demeanor, to seek
to drive her out of my Kingdoms; lest, by the influence of Her example,
eminent for love as a Wife, and Loyalty as a Subject, She should have
converted to, or retained in, their love, and Loyalty all those whom they had a
purpose to pervert.

The less I may be blessed with Her company, the more I will retire to God, and
my own Heart, whence no malice can banish Her. My Enemies may envy, but they
can never deprive me of the enjoyment of her virtues, while I enjoy my self.

Thou, O Lord, whose Justice at present sees fit to scatter us, let thy mercy
in thy due time, re*unite us, on earth, if it be thy will; however bring us
both at last, to thy heavenly Kingdom.

Preserve us from the hands of our despitefull and deadly Enemies; and prepare
us by our sufferings for thy presence.

Though we differ in some things, as to Religion, (which is My greatest
temporal infelicity) yet Lord give, and accept the sincerity of our
affections, which desire to seek, to find, to embrace every truth of thine.

Let both our Hearts agree in the love of thy self, and Christ crucified for
us.

Teach us both what thou would have us to know, in order to thy glory, our
public relations, and our souls eternal good, and make us careful to do
what good we know.

Let neither ignorance of what is necessary to be known, nor unbelief, or
disobedience to what we know, be our misery or our wilful default.

Let not this great scandal of those my Subjects, which profess the same
Religion with me, be any hindrance to her love of any Truth thou would have
her to learn, nor any hardening of her in any error, thou would have cleared
to her.

Let mine, and other men's constancy be an Antidote against the poison of their
example.

Let the Truth of that Religion I profess, be represented to her Judgment,
with all the beauties of Humility, Loyalty, Charity, and Peaceablenesse; which
are the proper fruits, and ornaments of it: Not in the odious disguises of
levity, Schism, Heresy, Novelty, Cruelty, and Disloyalty, which some men's
practices have lately put upon it.

Let her see thy sacred and saving Truths, as Thine; that she may believe, love
and obey them as Thine, cleared from all rust and dross of humane mixtures.
That in the glass of thy Truth she may see thee, in those mercies which thou
have offered to us, in thy Son Jesus Christ, our only Savior, and serve thee
in all th^se Holy duties, which most agree with his Holy Doctrine, and most
imitable example.

The experience we have of the vanity and uncertainty of all humane glory and
greatness in our scattering and eclypses, let it make us both so much the more
ambitious to be invested in those durable honors, and perfections, which are
only to be found in thy self, and obtained through Jesus Christ.

8. Upon His Majesty's repulse at Hull, and the fates of the Hothams.
MY repulse at Hull seemed at the first view an act of so rude disloyalty, that
My greatest Enemies had scarce confidence enough to abett, or own it: It was
the first overt Essay to be made, how patiently I could bear the Loss of My
Kingdoms.

God knows, it affected me more with shame and sorrow for others, then with
anger for My self; nor did the affront done to Me trouble Me so much as their
sin, which admitted no color or excuse.

I was resolved how to bear this, and much more, with patience: But I foresaw
they could hardly contain themselves within the compass of this one unworthy
act, who had effrontery enough to commit, or countenance it: This was but the
hand of that cloud, which was soon after to overspread the whole Kingdom, and
cast all into disorder and darkness.

For it is among the wicked Maxims of bold and disloyal Undertakers, that bad
actions must always be seconded with worse, and rather not be begun then not
carried on; for they think the retreat more dangerous then the assault, and
hate repentance more then perseverance in a fault.

This gave me to see clearly through all the pious disguises, and soft
palliations of some men; whose words were sometime smoother then oil, but now I
saw they would prove very Swords.

Against which I having (as yet) no defense, but that of a good conscience,
thought it my best policy [with patience] to bear what I could not remedy: And
in this (I thank God) I had the better of HOTHAM, that no disdain, or emotion
of passion transported me, by the indignity of his carriage, to do or say any
thing, unbeseeming my self, or unsuitable to that temper, which, in greatest
injuries, I think, best becoms a Christian, as coming nearest to the great
example of Christ.

And, indeed, I desire always more to remember I am a Christian, than a King;
for, what the Majesty of one might justly abhor, the charity of the other is
wiling to bear; what the height of a King tempts to revenge, the humility of
a Christian teaches to forgive. Keeping in compass all those impotent
passions, whose excess injures a man, more then his greatest Enemies can; for
these give their malice a full impression on our souls, which otherways
cannot reach very far, nor do us much hurt.

I cannot but observe how God not long after, so pleaded, and avenged My cause,
in the eye of the world, that the most wilfully blind cannot avoid the
displeasure to see it, and with some remorse and fear to own it as a notable
stroke, and prediction of divine vengeance.

For, Sir John Hotham unreproached, unthreatned, uncursed by any language or
secret imprecation of Mine, only blasted with the conscience of his own
wickedness, and falling from one inconstancy to another, not long after paies
his own and his eldest Sons heads, as forfeitures of their disloyalty, to
those men from whom surely he might have expected another reward then thus to
divide their heads from their bodies, whose hearts with them were divided from
their KING.

Nor is it strange that they who employed them at first in so high a service,
and so successful to them, should not find mercy enough to forgive Him, who
had so much premerited of them For, Apostasy unto Loyalty some men account the
most unpardonable sin.

Nor did a solitary vengeance serve the turn, the cutting off one head in a
Family is not enough to expiate the affront don to the head of the commonweal.
The eldest son must be involved in the punishment, as he was infected with the
sin of the Father, against the Father of his country: root and branch God
cuts off in one day.

These observations are obvious to every fancy: God knows, I was so far from
rejoicing in the Hotham's ruin, (though it were such as were able to give the
greatest thirst for revenge a full draught, being executed by them, who first
employed him against Me) that I so far pitied him, as I thought he at first
acted more against the light of his Conscience, then I hope many other men do
in the same cause.

For, he was never thought to be of that superstitious sowrnesse, which some
men pretend to, in matters of Religion; which so darkens their judgment that
they cannot see any thing of Sin and Rebellion in those means they use, with
intents to refrom to their Models, what they call Religion; who think all is
Gold of piety, which does but glister with a show of Zeal and fervency.

Sir John Hotham was (I think) a man of another temper, and so most liable to
those downright temptations of ambition, which have no cloak or cheat of
religion to impose upon themselves or others.

That which makes me more pity him is, that after he begun to have some
inclinations toward a repentance for his sin, and reparations of his duty to
Me, He should be so unhappy as to fall into the hands of their Justice, and not
my Mercy, who could as willingly have forgiven him, as he could have asked that
favor of Me. For I think clemency a debt, which we ought to pay to those that
crave it, when we have cause to believe they would not after abuse it, since
God himself suffers us not to pay any thing for his mercy but only prayers and
praises.

Poor Gentleman, he is now become a noteable monument of unprosperous
disloyalty, teaching the world by so sad and unfortunate a spectacle, that the
rude carriage of a Subject toward his Sovereign carries always its own
vengeance, as an unseparable shadow with it, and those often prove the most
fatal, and implacable Executioners of it, who were the first imployers in the
service.

Aftertimes will dispute it, whether Hotham were more infamous at Hull, or at
Tower Hill, though it is certain that no punishment so stains a man's Honor, as
wilful perpetrations of unworthy actions, which besides the conscience of the
sin, brands with most indelible characters of infamy, the name and memory to
posterity, who not engaged in the Factions of the times, have the most
impartial reflections on the actions. But thou, O Lord who have in so
remarkable a way avenged thy servant, suffer me not to take any secret pleasure
in it, for as his death has satisfied the injury he did to me, so let me not
by it gratify any passion in me, lest I make thy vengeance to be mine, and
consider the affront against me, more then the sin against thee.

Thou indeed, without any desire or endeavor of mine, have made his mischief
to return on his own head, and his violent dealing to come down on his own pate.

Thou have pleaded my cause, even before the sons of men, and taken the matter
into thine own hands; that men may know it was thy work, and see that thou,
Lord, have done it.

I do not, I dare not say, so let mine enemies perish O Lord! yea Lord, rather
give them repentance, pardon, and impunity, if it be thy blessed will.

Let not thy justice prevent the objects and opportunities of my mercy: yea,
let them live and amend who have most offended me in so high a nature: that I
may have those to forgive, who bear most proportion in their offenses to those
trespasses against thy Majesty, which I hope thy mercy has forgiven me.

Lord lay not their sins (who yet live) to their charge for condemnation, but
to their consciences for amendment: Let the lightning of this Thunderbolt,
which has been so severe a punishment to one, be a torrour to all.

Discover to them their sin, who know not they have done amiss: and scare
them from their sin, that sin of malicious wickedness.

That, preventing thy Judgments by their true repentance, they may escape the
strokes of thine eternal vengeance.

And do thou, O Lord, establish the Throne of thy servant in mercy, and truth
meeting together: let my Crown ever flourish in righteousness and peace,
kissing each other.

Hear my prayer, O Lord, who have taught us to pray for, to do good to, and to
love our Enemies, for thy sake: who have prevented us with offertures of thy
love, even when we were thine Enemies, and have sent thy Son Jesus Christ to
die for us, when we were disposed to crucify him.

9. Upon the listing, and raising Armies against the King.
I Find that I am at the same point and posture I was when they forced Me to
leave White Hall: what Tumults could not do, an Army must; which is but
Tumults listed, and enrolled too a better order, but as bad an end: My recesse
has given them confidence that I may be conquered.

And so I easily may as to any outward strength* which, God knows, is little
or none at all: But I have a Soul invincible through Gods grace enabling Me;
here I am sure to be Conqueror, if God will give Me such a measure of
Constancy, as to fear him more then man: and to love the inward peace of My
Conscience, before any outward tranquillity.

And must I be opposed with force; because they have not reason wherewith to
convince Me? O My Soul! be of good courage, they confess their known
weakness, as to truth and Justice, who choose rather to contend by Armies then
by Arguments.

Is this the reward and thanks that I am to receive for those many Acts of
Grace I have lately passed, and for those many Indignities I have endured? Is
there no way left to make Me a glorious KING but by My sufferings?

It is a hard and disputable choice for a King, that loves his People, and
desires their love, either to kill his own Subjects, or to be killed by them.

Are the hazards and miseries of Civil War in the bowels of My most
flourishing Kingdom, the fruits I must now reap, after 17. years living and
reigning among them, with such a measure of Justice, Peace, Plenty, and
Religion, as all Nations about either admired, or envied? notwithstanding some
miscarriages in Government, which might escape; rather through ill counsel of
some men driving on their private ends, or the peevishnes of others envying the
public should be managed without them, or the hidden and insuperable
necessities of State, then any propensity, I hope, of my self either to
injuriousnes or oppression.

Whose innocent blood during My Reign have I shed, to satisfy My lust, anger,
or covetousnes? what Widows or Orphans tears can witness against me, the
just cry of which must now be avenged with My own blood? For the hazards of War
are equal, nor does the Cannon know any respect of Persons.

In vain is My Person excepted by a Parenthesis of words, when so many hands
are armed against Me with Swords.

God knows how much I have studied to se^ what ground of Justice is alleged
for this Wa against Me; that so I might (by giving just satisfaction) either
prevent, or soon end so unnatural a motion; which (to many men) seem^ rather
the productions of a surfeit of peace, an^ wantonness of minds, or of private
discontents Ambition and Faction (which easily find, o make causes of quarrel)
then any real obstructions of public Justice, or Parliamentary Privilege.

But this is pretended, and this I must be ab^ to avoid and answer before God
in My ow^ Conscience; however some men are not wi^ling to believe Me, lest they
should condem^ themselves.

When I first with drew from White Hall, ^ see if I could allay the insolency
of the Tumul^ of the not suppressing of which no account i Reason can be given,
(where an orderly Gua^ was granted, but only to oppress both Mine a^ the Two
Houses freedom of declaring and voting according to every man's Conscience) wh^
obstructions of Justice were there further the this that what seemed just to
one man, might n^ seem so to another? Whom did I by pow^ protect against the
Justice of Parliament?

That some men withdrew, who feared t^ partiality of their trial, (warned by My
Lo^ of Straffords death) while the vulgar threatened to be their Oppressors, and
Judgers of their judges, was from that instinct, which is in all creatures to
preserve themselves. If any others refused to appear, where they evidently saw
the cur: rent of Justice and freedom so stopped and troubled by the Rabble,
that their lawful Judges either durst not come to the houses, or not declare
their sense with liberty and safety, it cannot seem strange to any reasonable
man; when the sole exposing them to public odium was enough to ruin them,
before the cause could be heard or tried.

Had not factious Tumults overborn the Freedom and Honor of the two Houses;
had they asserted their Justice against them, and made the way open for all the
Members quietly to come and declare their Consciences; I know no man so dear to
Me, whom I had the least inclination to advise either to withdraw himself, or
deny appearing upon their summons, to whose sentence according to Law, I think
every Subject bound to stand. Distempers (indeed) were risen to so great a
height, for want of timely repressing the vulgar insolences; that the greatest
guilt of those which were Voted and demanded as Delinquents was this, That they
would not suffer themselves o be over-awed with the Tumults, and their Pa^ons;
nor compelled to abet by their suffrages, ^r presence; the designs of those men
who agiated innovations, and ruin both in Church and ^^ate.

In this point I could not but approve their generous constancy and
catiousnesse; further then this I did never allow any man's refractorinesse
against the Privileges and Orders of the Houses; to whom I wished nothing
more, then Safety, Fullness, and Freedom.

But, the truth is, some men, and those not many, despairing in fair and
parliamentary ways, by free deliberations and Votes, to gain the concurrence of
the Major part of Lords and Common^ betook themselves (by the desperate
activity o factious Tumults) to sift and terrify away a^ those Members whom
they saw to be of contrary minds to their purposes.

How often was the business of the Bishops enjoying their Ancient places, and
undoubted Privileges in the House of Peers, carried for the^ by far the Major
part of Lords. Yet after fi^ repulses, contrary to all Order and Custom, ^ was
by tumultuary instigations obtruded again and by a few carried, when most of
the Pee^ were forced to absent themselves.

In like manner, was the Bill against Root a^ Branch brought on by tumultuary
Clamours, ^ schismatic Terrors; which could never pas^ till both houses
were sufficiently thinned a^ overawed. To which Partiality, while in all
reason, Justice, and Religion, My conscience forb^ Me by consenting to make up
their Votes ^ Acts of Parliament, I must now be urged wi^ an Army, and
constrained either to hazard M own, and My Kingdoms ruins, by My Defense; or
prostrate My Conscience to the blind obedience of those men, whose zealous
superstition thinks, or pretends, they cannot do God and the Church a greater
service, than utterly to destroy that Primitive, Apostolical, and anciently
Universal Government of the Church by Bishops.

Which if other men's Judgments bind them to maintain, or forbids them to
consent to the abolishing of it, Mine much more, who, besides the grounds I
have in My Judgment, have also a most strikt and indispensable Oath upon My
Conscience, to preserve that Order, and the Rights of the Church; to which,
(most Sacrilegious and abhorred Perjury,) most un-beseeming a Christian King,
should I ever by giving My consent, be betrayed, I should account it infinitely
greater misety, then any has, or can befall Me; in as much, as the least sin
has more evil in it, then the greatest affliction. Had I gratified their
Anti-episcopall Faction at first in this point, with My consent; and sacrificed
the Ecclesiastical Government, and Revenues, to the fury of their
covetousness, ambition, and Revenge, I believe they would then have found no
colorable necessity of raising an Army to fetch in, and punish Delinquents.

That I consented to the Bill of putting the Bishops out of the House of Peers,
was done with a firm persuasion of their contentedn^ to suffer a present
diminution in their Rights and Honor for My sake, and the Common weals; which
I was confident they would readily yield unto rather then occasion (by the lea^
obstruction on their part) any dangers to Me, o to My Kingdom. That I cannot
add My consent for the total extirpation of that Government (which I have
often offered to all fit regulations) has so much further tie upon My
Conscience, as what I think Religious and Apostolical; and so very Sacred and
Divine, as no to be dispensed with, or destroyed; when what ^ only of civil
Favor, and privilege of Hono^ granted to men of that Order, may with the^
consent, who are concerned in it, be annu^ led.

This is the true state of those obstruction pretended to be in point of
Justice and Authority of Parliament; when, I call God to witne^ I knew none of
such consequence as was wort speaking of a War, being only such as J^stice,
Reason, and Religion had made in My ow and there men's Consciences.

Afterward indeed a great show of Delinquents was made; which were but
conseque^ces necessarily following upon Mine, or other withdrawing from, or
defense against vi^lence: but those could not be the first occasion of raising
an Army against Me. Wherein was so far from preventing them, (as the have
declared often, that they might seem to have the advantage and Justice of the
defensive part, and load Me with all the envy and injuries of first assaulting
them) that God knows, I had not so much as any hopes of an army in My thoughts.
Had the Tumults been Honorably and effectually repressed by exemplary Justice,
and the liberty of the Houses so vindicated, that all Members of either house
might with Honor and Freedom, becoming such a Senate, have come and
discharged their Consciences, I had obtained all that I designed by My
withdrawing, and had much more willingly, and speedily returned then I retired;
this being my necessity driving, the other my choice desiring.

But some men knew, I was like to bring the same judgment and constancy, which
I carry with me, which would never fit their designs* and so while they
invited me to come, and greivously complained of my absence, yet they could not
but be pleased with it: especially when they had found out that plasible and
popular pretext of raising an Army to fetch in Delinquents: when all that while
they never punished the greatest and most intolerable Delinquency of the
Tumults, and their Exciters, which drove my self, and so many of both Houses
from their places, by most barbarous indignities, which yet in all reason and
Honor, they were as loath to have deserted as those others were willing they
should, that so they might have occasion to persecute them with the Injuries of
an Army, for not suffering more tamely the Injuries of the Tumults.

That this is the true state, and first drift and design in raising an Army
against Me, is by the sequel so evident, that all other pretenses vanish. For
when they declared by Propositions, or Treaties, what they would have to
appease them; there was nothing of consequence offered to Me, or demanded of
Me, as any original difference in any point of Law, or order of Justice. But
among other lesser Innovations, this chiefly was urged, The Abolition of
Episcopal, and the Establishment of Presbyterian Government.

All other things at any time propounded were either impertinent as to any
ground of a War, or easily granted by Me, and only to make up a number, or else
they were merely consequentiall, and accessory, after the War was by them
unjustly began.

I cannot hinder other men's thoughts, whom the noise and show of piety, and
heat for Reformation and Religion, might easily so fill with prejudice, that
all equality and clearness of judgment might be obstructed. But this was, and
is, as to my best observation, the true state of affairs between us, when
they first raised an Army, with this design, either to stop My mouth, or to
force My consent: and in this truth, as to My conscience, (who was (God knows)
as far from meditating a War, as I was in the eye of the world from having any
preparation for one) I find that comfort, that in the midst of all the
unfortunate successes of this War, on My side, I do not think My Innocence
any whit prejudiced or darkened; Nor am I without that integrity, and Peace
before God, as with humble confidence to address My Prayer to Him.

For Thou, O Lord, see clearly through all the cloudings of humane affairs;
Thou Judge without prejudice: Thy Omniscience eternally guids thy unerrable
Judgment.

O my God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of violent men
have sought after my soul, and have not set Thee before their eyes.

Consider my Enemies, O Lord, for they are many, and they hate me with deadly
hatred, without a cause.

For Thou know, I had no passion, design or preparation to embroyle My
Kingdoms in a Civil War; whereto I had least temptation; as knowing I must
adventure more then any, and could gain least of any by it.

Thou O Lord, art my witness how often I have deplored, and studied to divert
the necessity thereof, wherein I cannot well be thought so prodigally thirsty
of my Subjects blood, as to venture my own life, which I have bin often compelled
to do^ in this unhappy War; and which were better spent to save then to
destroy my People.

O Lord; I need much of thy grace, with patience to bear the many afflictions
thou have suffered some men to bring upon me; but much more to bear the unjust
reproaches of those, who not content that I suffer most by war, will needs
persuade the world that I have raised first, or given just cause to raise it.

The confidence of some men's false tougues is such, that they would make me
almost suspect my own Innocence yea, I could be content (at least by my
silence) to take upon me so great a guilt before men, If by that I might allay
the malice of my Enemies, and redeem My People from this miserable War;
since thou O Lord know my Innocence in this thing. Thou will find out bloody
and deceitful men; many of whom have not lived out half their days, in which
they promised themselves the enioyment of the fruits of their violent and wicked
Counsels.

Save, O Lord thy servant, as hitherto thou have; and in thy due time scatter
the people that delight in War.

Arise O Lord, lift up thy self, because of the rage of mine Enemies, which
increases more and more: Behold them that have conceived mischief, traveled
with iniquity, and brought forth falsehood.

Thou know the chief design of this War is, either to destroy my Person,
or force My Judgment, and to make Me renege my Conscience and thy Truth.

I am driven to cross David's choice; and desire rather to fall into the hands
of men, by denying them, (though their mercy be cruel) then into thy hands by
sinning against My Conscience, and in that against thee, who art a consuming
fire; Better they destroy Me, then thou should damn Me.

Be thou ever the defense of My soul, who wilt save the upright in heart.

If nothing but My blood will satisfy My Enemies, or quench the flames of My
Kingdoms, or thy temporal Justice, I am content, if it be thy will, that it
be shed by Mine own Subjects hands.

But O let the blood of Me, though their King, yet a sinner, be dashed with the
blood of My Innocent and peacemaking Redeemer, for in that thy Justice, will
find not only a temporary expiation, but an eternal plenary satisfaction; both
for my sins, and the sins of my People; whom I beseech thee still own for
thine; and when thy wrath is appeased by my Death, O Remember thy great mercies
toward them, and forgive them, O my Father, for they know not what they do.

10* Upon their seizing the Kings Magazines, Forts, Navy, and Militia.
HOw untruly I am Charged with the first raising of an ARMY, and beginning this
Civil War, the eyes that only pity me, and the Loyal hearts that durst
only pray for me, at first, might witness, which yet appear not so many on my
side, as there were men in Arms listed against me; my unpreparednesse for a War
man well dis-hearten those that would help me; while it argues (truly) my
unwillingnesse to fight, yet it testifies for Me, that I am set on the
defensive part; having so little hopes or power to offend others, that I have
none to defend my self, or to preserve what is mine own from their prereption.

No man can doubt but they prevented Me, in their purposes, as well as their
injuries, who are so much beforehand in their preparations against Me, and
surprizalls of My strength. Such as are not for Them, yet dare not be for Me;
so overaw'd is their Loyalty by the others numbers and terrors. I believe my
Innocence, and unpreparednesse to assert my Rights and Honor, makes Me the
more guilty in their esteem; who would not so easily have declared a war
against Me, if I had first assaulted them.

They knew my chiefest Arms left Me, were those only, which the ancient
Christians were wont to use against their Persecutors, Prayers and Tears. These
may serve a good man's turn, if not to Conquer as a Soldier, yet to Suffer as a
Martyr.

Their preventing of Me, and surprising My Castles, Forts, Arms, and Navy,
with the Militia, is so far best for Me, That it may drive me from putting any
trust in the arm of flesh, and wholly to cast my self into the protection of
the living God, who can save by few, or none, as well as by many.

He that made the greedy Ravens to be ELYAS Caterers, and bring him food, may
also make their surprizall of outward force and defense, an opportunity to show
me the special support of his power and protection.

I thank God I reckon not now the want of the Militia so much in reference to
My own protection as My Peoples*

Their many and sore oppressions greive Me, I am above My Own; what I want in
the hands of Force and Power, I have in the wings of faith and Prayer.

But this is the strange method these Men will needs take to resolve their
riddle of making me a glorious King, by taking away my Kingly power: Thus I
shall become a support to My Friends, and a Terror to My Enemies, by being
unable to succor the one, or suppress the other. For thus have they designed,
and proposed to Me the new-modelling of Sovereignty and kingship; as without
any reality of power, so without any necessity of subjection and obedience;
That the Majesty of the Kings of England might hereafter hang like Mahomets
Tomb, by a magnetique Charm, between the Power and Privileges of the two
Houses in an aerie imagination of Regality.

But, I believe, the surfeit of too much Power, which some men have greedily
seized on, and now seek wholly to devour, will ere long make the Commonwealth
sick both of it and them, since they cannot well digest it; Sovereign Power in
Subjects seldom agreeing with the stomachs of fellow Subjects.

Yet I have even in this point of the constant Militia sought, by satisfying
their fears, and importunities, both to secure My Friends, and overcom Mine
enemies, to gain the peace of al, by depriving My self of a sole power to
help, or hurt any: yiedling the Militia (which is my undoubted Right no less
than the Crown) to be disposed of; as the two Houses shall think fit, during
My time.

So willing am I to bury all jealousies of me, in them, and to live above all
jealousies of them, as to My self; I desire not to be safer than I wish them
and My People, if I had the sole actual disposing of the Militia, I could not
protect My People, further than they protected Me, and themselves: so that the
use of the Militia is mutual. I would but defend My self so far, as to be able
to defend My good Subjects from those men's violence and fraud, who conscious to
their own evil merits and designs, will needs persuade the world, that none
but Wolves are fit to be trusted with the custody of the Shepherd and his
Flock. Miserable experience has taught My Subjects, since Power has been
wrested from Me, and employed against Me and Them, that neither can be safe, if
both be not in such a way as the Law has entrusted the public safety and
welfare.

Yet even this Consession of Mine as to the exercise of the Militia, so vast
and large, is not satisfactory to some men; which seem to be Enemies not to Me
only, but to all Monarchy; and are resolved to transmit to posterity such
Jealousies of the Crown, as they should never permit it to enjoy its just and
necessary Rights, in point of Power; to which (at last) all Law is resolved,
while thereby it is best protected.

But here Honor and Justice, due to My Successors, forbid Me to yield to such
a total alienation of that power from them, which civility and duty (no less
then justice and honor) should have forbad them to have asked of Me.

For, although I can be content to Eclypse My own beams, to satisfy their
fears, who think they must needs be scorched or blinded, if I should shine in
the full lusture of Kingly Power, wherewith God and the Laws have invested Me;
yet I will never consent to put out the Sun of Sovereignty to all Posterity,
and succeeding Kings; whose just recovery of their Rights, from unjust
usurpations and extortions, shall never be prejudiced or obstructed by any Act
of Mine; which indeed would not be more injurious to succeeding Kings, than to
My Subjects; whom I desire to leave in a condition not wholly desperate for the
future; so as by a Law to be ever subjected to those many factious
distractions, which must needs follow the many-headed Hydra of Government:
which, as it makes a show to the People to have more eyes to foresee, so they
will find it has more mouths too, which must be satisfied: and (at best) it
has rather a monstrosity, than any thing of perfection, beyond that of right
Monarchy; where counsel may be in many as the senses, but the supreme Power
can be but in One as the Head.

Happily, when men have tried the horrors and malignant influence which will
certainly follow My enforced darkness and Eclypse, (occasioned by the
interposition and shadow of that body, which as the Moon receives its
chiefest light from Me) they will at length more esteem and welcome the
restored glory and blessing of the Suns light.

And, if at present I may seem by My receding so much from the use of My Right
in the power of the Militia, to come short of the discharge of that trust, to
which I am sworn for My Peoples protection. I conceive those men are guilty of
the enforced perjury, (if so it may seem) who compel Me to take this new and
strange way of discharging My trust, by seeming to desert it; of protecting My
Subjects, by exposing My self to danger or dishonor, for their safety and
quiet.

Which, in the conflicts of Civil War and advantages of Power, cannot be
effected but by some side yiedling; to which the greatest love of the public
Peace, and the firmest assurance of Gods protection (arising from a good
conscience) does more invite Me, than can be expected from other men's fears;
which arising from the injustice of their Actions (though never so
successful) yet dare not adventure their Authors upon any other way of safety
then that of the Sword and Militia; which yet are but weak defenses against the
strokes of divine vengeance, which will overtake; or of men's own Consciences,
which always attend injurious perpetrasions.

For my self, I do not think that I can want any thing which providentiall
necessity is pleased to take from Me, in order to my Peoples tranquillity and
Gods glory, whose protection is sufficient for me; and he is able, by his being
with me, abundantly to compensate to Me, as he did to Job, what ever honor,
power, or liberty the Caldeans, the Sabeans, or the Devil himself can deprive
Me of.

Although they take from Me all defense of Arms and Militia; all refuge by
Land, of Forts, and Castles; all flight by Sea in My Ships, and Navy; yea,
though they study to Rob me of the Hearts of my Subjects, the greatest Treasure
and best Ammunition of a King, yet cannot they deprive me of my own innocence,
or Gods mercy nor obstruct My way to Heaven-

Therefore, O my God, to thee I fly for help, if the wilt be on my side, J
shall have more with we the can be against me.

There is none in Heaven, or in Earth, that I desire in comparison of thee; In
the loss of all, ^ thou more then all to me: Make have to succor (...) thou
that never failest them, that put their trust ^ thee.

Thou see I have no power to oppose them the come against me, who are
encouraged to fight und^ the pretense of fighting for me: But my eyes a^ toward
thee.

Thou need no help, nor shall I, if I may ha^ thine; If not to conquer, yet
at least to suffer.

If thou delightest not in my safety, and prosperi^ behold here am I, willing
to be reduced to what the wilt have me; whose Judgments often begin with (...)
own Children.

I am content to be nothing, that thou may be all*

Thou have taught me, That no King can be sav^ by the multitude of an Host; but
yet thou can sa^ me by the multitude of thy mercyes, who art the L^ of Hosts,
and the Father of mercies.

Help Me, O Lord, who am sore distressed on e^ry side; yet be thou on my side,
and I shall not fe^ what man can do unto me. I will give thy justi the glory of
mydistresse.

O let thy mercy have the glory of my delivra^ from them that persecute my
Soul!

By my sins have I fought against thee, a^ robbed thee of thy glory, who am
thy subject; and justly may thou, by my own Subjects, strip me of my
strength, and eclypse my glory.

But show thy self, O my hope, and only refuge! Let not mine Enemies say,
There is no help for him in his God.

Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not.

Keep me as the apple of thine eye, hide me under the sh^ddow of thy wings.

Show thy marveilous loving kindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand
them that put their trust in thee, from those that rise up against them.

From the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly Enemies that compass me
about.

Show me the path of life. In thy presence is fullness of Joy, at thy right
hand there are pleasures for evermore.

11. Upon the 19* Propositions first sent to the King; and more afterward.
ALthough there be many things, they demand, yet if these be all, I am glad to
see at what price they set My own safety, and My Peoples peace; which I cannot
think I buy at too dear a rate, save only the parting with my Conscience
and Honor. If nothing else will satisfye, I must choose rathe^ to be as
miserable, and inglorious, as My Enemies can make or wish Me.

Some things here propounded to me have bi^ offered by me; Others are easily
granted; The rest (I think) ought not to be obtruded upon me with the point of
the Sword; nor urged with the injuries of a war; when I have already declare^
that I cannot yield to them, without violatin^ my Conscience: it is strange,
there can be n^ method of peace, but by making War upon My Soul.

Here are many things required of me; but ^ see nothing offered to me, by the
way of grate*full exchange of Honor; or any requital for those favors, I
have, or can yet grant them.

This Honor they do me, to put me o^ the giving part, which is more princely
an^ divine. They cannot ask more than I can give, may I but reserve to my self
the incommunicable Jewel of my Conscience; and not be forced to part with
that, whose loss nothing ca^ repair or requite.

Some things (which they are pleased to propound) seem unreasonable to Me; and
while I have any mastery of My Reason, how ca^ they think I can consent to
them? who kno^ they be such as are inconsistent with being either a KING, or a
good Christian. My yiedling so much (as I have already) makes some men
confident I will deny nothing.

The love I have of My Peoples peace, has (indeed) great influence upon me;
but the love of Truth, and inward peace, has more.

Should I grant some things they require, I should not so much weaken My
outward state of a King; as wound that inward quiet of My Conscience, which
ought to be, is, and ever shall be (by Gods grace) dearer to Me than My
kingdoms.

Some things which a King might approve yet in Honor and Policy are at some
time to be denied, to some men, lest he should seem not to dare to deny any
thing; and give too much encouragement to unreasonable Demands, or
importunities.

But to bind My self to a general and implicit consent, to what ever they
shall desire, or propound, (for such is one of their Propositions) were such a
latitude of blind obedience, as never was expected from any Freeman, nor fit
to be required of any man, much less of a King, by His own Subjects; any of
whom he may possibly exceed as much in wisdom, as he does in place and power.

This were as if Sampson should have consented, not only to bind his own
hands, and cut off his hair, but to put out his own eyes, that the Philistines
might with the more safety mock, and abuse him; which they chose rather to do,
then quite to destroy him, when he was become so tame an object, and fit
occasion for their sport and scorn.

Certainly, to exclude all power of denial seems an arrogance, least of all
becoming those who pretend to make their addresses in a^ humble and loyal way
of petitioning; who, by that, sufficiently confess their own inferiority*
which obliges them to rest, if not satisfied, y^ quieted with such an answer
as the will and reason of their Superior thinks fit to give; wh^ is
acknowledged to have a freedom and power of Reason, to Consent, or Dissent;
else it were uery foolish and absurd to ask, what anothe having not liberty to
deny, neither has powe to grant.

But if this be My Right belonging to Me, i^ Reason, as a Man, and in Honor as
a Sovereign King, (as undoubtedly it does) how can i be other then extreme
injury to confine my Reason to a necessity of granting all they have^ mind to
ask, whose minds may be as differin^ from mine both in Reason and Honor, as
their aims may be, and their qualities are; which la^ God and the Laws have
sufficiently distinguish^ making me their Sovereign, and them my Subjects:
whose Propositions may soon prov^ violent oppositions, if once they gain to
be necessary impositions upon the Regal Authority Since no man seeks to limit
and confine his King in Reason, who has not a secret aim to shar^ with him,
or usurp upon him in power and domion. But they would have me trust to their
moderation, and abandon mine own discretion that so I might verify what
representations some have made of me to the world, that I am fitter to be their
Pupil then their Prince. Truly I am not so confident of my own sufficiency, as
not willingly to admit the Counsel of others: But yet I am not so diffident of
my self, as brntishly to submit to any man's dictates, and at once to betray the
Sovereignty of Reason in my soul, and the Majesty of my own Crown to any of my
Snbjects.

Least of all have I any ground of credulity, to induce me fully to submit to
all the desires of those men, who will not admit, or, do refuse, and neglect to
vindicate the freedom of their own and others, Sitting and Voting in
Parliament.

Besides, all men that know them, know this, how young Statesmen (the most
part) of these Propounders are; so that, till experience of one seven yearts
has showed me, how well they can Govern themselves, and so much power as is
wrested from me, I should be very foolish indeed, and unfaithful in my Trust,
to put the reins of both Reason and Government, wholly out of my own, into to
their hands, whose driving is already too much like Iehues; and whose
forwardness to ascend the Throne of Supremacy portends more of Phaeton then of
Phoebus; God divert the Omen if it be his will.

They may remember, that at best they sit in Parliament as My Subjects, not my
superiors, called to be my Counselors, not Dictators* Their Summons extends
to Recommend their advice, not to command my Duty.

When I first heard of Propositions to be sen^ Me, I expected either some good
Laws, which had been antiquated by the course of time, o^ overlayd by the
corruption of manners, had bi^ desired to a restoration of their vigor an^
due execution; or some evil customs preterlegall, and abuses personal had
been to be removed; or some injuries done by My self, an^ others, to the
Commonweal, were to be repaired; or some equable offertures were to b^
tendered to Me, wherein the advantages of my Crown, being considered by them,
might fairly induce me to condescend, to what tended to my Subjects good,
without any great diminution o^ My self; whom Nature, Law, Reason, an^
Religion, bind me (in the first place) to preserve: without which, it is
impossible to preserve my People according to my Place.

Or (at least) I looked for such moderate desires of due Reformation of what
was (indeed) amiss in Church and State, as migh still preserve the foundation
and essentialls o Government in both; not shake and quite ove^ throw either of
them, without any regar^ of the Laws, enforce, the wisdom and piet^ of former
Parliaments, the ancient and universal practice of Christian Churches; the
Rights and Privileges of particular men Nor yet any thing offered in lieu, or
in the room of what must be destroyed, which might at once reach the good end
of the others Institution, and also supply its pretended defects, reform its
abuses, and satisfy sober and wise men, not with soft and specious words,
pretending zeal and special piety, but with pregnant and solid reasons both
divine and humane, which might justify the abruptness and necessity of such
vast alterations.

But in all their Propositions I can observe little of these kinds, or to these
ends; Nothing of any Laws dis-joynted, which are to be restored; of any right
invaded; of any Justice to be unobstructed; of any compensations to be made; of
any impartial reformation to be granted; to al, or any of which, reason,
Religion, true Policy, or any other humane motives, might induce me.

But, as to the maine matters propounded by them at any time, in which is
either great novelty, or difficulty, I perceive that what were formerly looked
upon as Factions in the State, and Schisms in the Church, and so, punishable
by the Laws, have now the confidence, by vulgar clamours, and assistance
(chiefly) to demand not only Tolerations of themselves, in their vanity,
novelty, and confusion; but also Abolition of the Laws against them; and a
total extirpation of that Government, whose Rights they have a mind to invade.

This, as to the maine; other Propositions are (for the most part) but as waste
paper, in those which are wrapped up, to present them somewhat more handsomely.
Nor do I so much wonder at the variety, and horrible novelty of some
Propositions (therebeing nothing so monstrous, which some fancies are not prone
to long for. This casts me into, not an admiration, but an ecstasy, how such
things should have the fortun to be propounded in the name of the two Houses of
the Parliament of England: among whom, I am very confident, there was not a
fourth part of the Members of either House, whose judgments free, single, and
apart did approve or desire such dstructive changes in the Government of the
Church.

I am persuaded there remains in far the major part of both Houses, (if free
and full) so much learning, Reason, Religion, and just moderation as to know
how to sever between the use an^ the abuse of things; the institution, and the
corruption, the Government and the Mis-government, the Primitive Patterns; and
the abberrations or blottings of after Copies.

Sure they could not all, upon so little, or n^ reason (as yet produced to the
contrary) so soon renounce all regard to the Laws in force, to antiquity, to
the piety of their reforming Progenitors, to the prosperity of former times in
this Church and state, under the present Government of the Church.

Yet, by a strange fatality, these men suffer, either by their absence, or
silence, or negligence, or supine credulity (believing that all is Gold, which
is gilded with shows of Zeal and Reformation) their private disse nting in
judgment to be drawn into the common sewer or stream of the present vogue and
humor; which has its chief rise and abetment from those popular clamours and
Tumults, which served to give life and strength to the infinite activity of
those men, who studied with all diligence, and policy, to improve to their
Innovating designs, the present distractions.

Such Armies of Propositions having so little, in My Judgment, of reason, J
ustice, and Religion on their side, as they had Tumult and Faction for their
rise, must not go alone, but ever be backed and seconded, with Armies of
Soldiers: Though the second should prevail against My Person, yet the first
shall never overcome Me, further than I see cause; for, I look not at their
number and power so much, as I weigh their Reason and Justice.

Had the two Houses first sued out their livery, and once effectually redeemed
themselves from the Wardship of the Tumults, (which can be no other than the
Hounds that attend the cry, and hollow of those Men, who hunt after Factious
and private Designs, to the ruin of Church and State.)

Did my judgment tell Me, that the Proposions sent to Me were the Results of
the Major part of their votes, who exercise their freedom, as well as they
have a right to sit in Parliliament, I should then suspect My own judgment;
for not speedily and fully concurring with every one of them.

For, I have charity enough to think, there are wise men among them: and
humility to think, that, as in some things I may want; so it is fit I should use
their advise; which is the end for which I called them to a Parliament. But yet
I cannot allow their wisdom such a compleatnesse and inerrability as to exclude
My self; since none of them has that part to Act, that Trust to discharge, nor
that Estate and Honor to preserve as My self; without whose Reason concurrent
with theirs (as the Suns influence is necessary in Nallatures productions) they
cannot beget, or bring forth any one complete and authoritative Act of public
wisdom, which makes the Laws. But the unreasonablenesse of some Propositions
not is more evident to Me, than this is, That they are not the joint and free
desires of those in their Major number, who are of right to Sit and Vote in
Parliament.

For, many of them savor very strong of that old leaven of Innovations, masked
under the name of Reformation; which, in my two last famous Predecessors
days, heaved at, and sometime threatened both Prince and Parliaments: But, I am
sure was never wont so far to infect the whole mass of the Nobility and
Gentry of this Kingdom; however it dispersed among the vulgar: Nor was it
likely so suddenly to taynt the Major part of both Houses, as that they should
unanimously desire, and affect so enormous and dangerous innovations in Church
and State, contrary to their former education, practice, and judgment.

Not that I am ignorant, how the choice of many Members was carried by much
faction in the Countries; some thirsting after nothing more, than a passionate
revenge of what ever displeasure they had conceived against me, my Court, or
the Clergy.

But all reason bids me impute these sudden and vast desires of change to those
few, who armed themselves with the many-headed, and many*handed Tumults.

No less does Reason, Honor; and Safety both of Church and State command me,
to chew such morsells, before I let them down; If the straitnes of my conscience
will not give me leave to swallow down such Camels, as others do of sacriledg,
and injustice both to God and man, they have no more cause to quarrel withme,
than for this, that my throat is not so wide as theirs. Yet, by Gods help, I am
resolved, That nothing of passion, or peevishness, or list to contradict, or
vanity to show my negative power, shall have any byas upon my judgment, to make
me gratify my will, by denying any thing, which my Reason and Conscience
commands me not.

Nor on the other side, will I consent to more than Reason, Justice, Honor,
and Religion persuade me, to be for Gods glory, the Churches good, my Peoples
welfare, and my own peace.

I will study to satisfy my Parliament, and my People; but I will never, for
fear, or flattery, gratify any Faction, how potent soever; for this were to
nourish the disease, and oppres the body.

Although many men's loyalty and prudence are terrified from giving me that
free, and faithful counsel, which they are able and willing to impart, and I
may want; yet none can hinde^ me from craving the counsel of that mighty
Counselor, who can both suggest what is best, and incline my heart steadfastly
to follow it.

O thou first and eternal Reason, whose wisdom^ is fortified with omnipotency,
furnish thy Servant* first, with clear discoveries of Truth, Reason, an^
Justice, in My understanding; then so confirm My will and resolution to
adheere to them* that no terrors, Injuries, or oppressions of my Enemies may
ever enforce me against those rules, which thou by them have planted in My
Conscience.

Thou never made me a King, that I should (...) less then a Man; and not
dare to say, Yea, or Na^ as I see cause; which freedom is not denied to the
meanest creature, that has the use of Reason, an^ liberty of speech.

Shall that be blameable in Me, which is commendable veracity and constancy in
others?

Thou see, O Lord, with what partiality, an^ injustice, they deny that
freedom to me their KING, which Thou have given to all Men; and which
Themselves pertinaciously challenge to themselves; while they are so tender of
the least breach of their privileges.

To thee I make my supplication, who can guide us by an unerring rule,
through the perplexed labyrinths of our own thought, and other men's proposalls;
which, I have some cause to suspect, are purposely cast as snares, that by My
granting or denying them, I might be more eutangled in those difficultyes,
wherewith they lie in wayt to afflict Me.

O Lord, make thy way plain before Me.

Let not my own sinful passions cloud, or divert thy sacred suggestions.

Let thy glory be my end, thy word my rule, and then thy will be done.

I cannot please all, I care not to please some men; If I may be happy to
please thee, I need not fear whom I displease.

Thou that make the wisdom of the world foolishnesle, and take in their
own devices, such as are wise in their own conceits, make Me wise by thy truth,
for thy Honor, my Kingdoms general good, and my own souls salvation; and J
shall not much regard the worlds opinion, or diminution of me.

The less wisdom they are willing to impute to me, the more they shall be
convinced of thy wisdom directing me, while I deny nothing fit to be granted,
out of crosseness, or humor; nor grant any thing which is to be denied, out of
any fear, o^ flattery of men.

Suffer me not to be guilty, or unhappy, by willing or inconsiderate advancing
any men's designs, which are injurious to the public good, while confirm
them by my consent.

Nor let me be any occasion to hinder or defrau^ the public of what is best,
by any morose or perverse dissentings.

Make me so humbly charitable, as to follow their advise, when it appears to be
for the public good* of whose affections to me, I have yet but few evidences
to assure Me.

Thou can as well bless honest errors, as bl^^ fraudulent counsels.

Since we must give an account of every evil an^ idle word in private, at thy
tribunal; Lord man me careful of those solemn Declarations of m^ mind which
are like to have the greatest influent upon the Public, either for woe, or
weal.

The less others consider what they ask, make (...) the more solicitous what
I answer.

Though Mine. own, and My Peoples pressur^ are grievous, and peace would be
very pleasing yet, Lord, never suffer Me to avoid the one, or purchase the
other, with the least expense or waste^ My Conscience; whereof thou, O Lord,
one^ art deservedly more Master then My self.

12 Upon the Rebellion and troubles in Ireland:
THe Commotions in Ireland were so sudden, and so violent, that it was hard at
first either to discern the rise, or apply a remedy to that precipitant
rebellion.

Indeed, that Sea of blood, which has there bin cruelly and barbarously shed,
is enough to drown any man in eternal both infamy and misery, whom God shall
find the malicious Author or Instigator of its effusion.

It fell out, as a most unhappy advantage to some men's malice against me, that,
when they had impudence enough to lay any thing to my charge, this bloody
opportunity should be offered them, with which I must be aspersed. Although
there was nothing which could be more abhorred to me, being so full of sin
against God, disloyalty to my self, and destructive to my Subjects.

Some men took it very ill not to be believed, when they affirmed, that what
the Irish Rebels did, was done with my privitie (at least) if not by my
Commission: But these knew too well, that it is no news for some of my
Subjects to ^ight, not only without my Commission, but against my Command, and
Person too; yet all the while to pretend, they fight by my Authori^y, and for
my safety.

I would to God the Irish had nothing to a ledge for their imitation against
those, who blame must need be the greater, by how mu^ Protestant Principles
are more against all R^bellion against Princes, then those of Papi^ Nor will the
goodness of men's intentions exc^ the scandal, and contagion of their Examples.

But, who ever fail of their Duty toward me, must bear the blame; this Honor
my Enemi^ have always don me, to think moderate injuri^ not proportionate to
me, nor competent trial^ either of my patience under them, or my pard^ of them,

Therefore, with exquisite malice, they ha^ mixed the gall and vinegar of
falsity and contem^ with the cup of My Afflicton; Charging Me (...) only with
untruths, but such, as wherein I ha^ the greatest share of loss and dishonor
by wh^ is committed; whereby (in all Policy, Reason and religion, having least
cause to give, the le^ consent, and most grounds of utter detestation might be
represented by them to the world, (...) more inhumane and barbarous: Like some
C^ clopick monster, whom nothing will serve to (...) and drink, but the flesh
and blood of my ow^ Subjects; in whose common welfare my in^rest lies, as much
as some men's does in their pe^turbations; who think they cannot do well (...) in
evil times, nor so cunningly as in laying (...) odium of those sad events on
others, where w^ themselves are most pleased, and whereof they ha^ bin not the
least occasion.

And certainly, it is thought by many wife men, that the preposterous rigor, and
unreasonable severity, which some men carried before them in England, was not
the least incentive, that kindled, and blew up into those horrid flames, the
sparks of discontent, which wanted not pre-disposed fuel for Rebellion in
Ireland; where, despair being added to their former discontents, and the fears
of utter extirpation to their wonted oppressions, it was easy to provoke to an
open Rebellion, a people prone enough, to break out to all exorbitant violence,
both by some Principles of their Religion, and the natural desires of liberty*
both to exempt themselves from their present restraints, and to prevent those
after rigours wherewith they saw themselves apparently threatened, by the
covetous zeal and uncharitable fury of some men, who think it a great argument
of the Truth of their Religion, to endure no other but their own.

God knows, as I can with Truth wash my hands in Innocence, as to any guilt in
that rebellion; so I might wash them in my Tears, as to the sad apprehensions I
had, to see it spread so far, and make such waste. And this in a time, when
distractions, and jealousies here in Eugland, made most men rather intent to
their own safety, or designs they were driving, then to the relief of those,
who were every day inhumanely butchered in IRELAND: Whose ^eares and blood
might, if nothing else, have quenched, or at least, for a time* repressed a^
smothered those sparks of Civil dissentions (...) Jealousies, which in England
some men mo^ industriously scattered.

I would to God no man had been less affect^ with Irelands sad estate than my
self, I offer^ to go my self in Person upon that expedition But some men were
either afraid I should ha^ any one Kingdom quieted; or loath they we^ to shoot
at any mark here less then my self or that any shonld have the glory of my
destr^ction but themselves. Had my many offers b^ accepted, I am confident
neither the ruin h^ bin so great, nor the calamity so long, nor t^ remedy so
desperate.

So that, next to the sin of those, who began the Rebellion, theirs must needs
be, who either hi^dred the speedy suppressing of it, by domesti^ dissentions,
or diverted the Aides, or exasper^ted the Rebels to the most desperate
resolu^ons and actions, by threatening al extremities, n^ only to the known
heads, and chief incendiary^ but even to the whole community of that Na^on;
Resolving to destroy Root and Branch, Me^ Women, and Children; without any
regard (...) those usual pleas for mercy, which Couqu^rours, not wholly
barbarous, are wont to hea^ from their own breasts, in behalf of thos^ whose
oppressive fears, rather then their m^ lice, engaged them; or whose imbecility
f^ Sex and Age was such, as they could neith^ lift up a hand against them, nor
distinguish between their right hand and their left: Which preposterous, and (I
think) un-evangelical Zeal is too like that of the rebuked Disciples, who
would go no lower in their revenge, then to call for fire from Heaven upon
whole Cities for the repulse or neglect of a few; or like that of Jacobs sons*
which the Father both blamed and cursed: choosing rather to use all extremityes,
which might drive men to desperate obstinacy, then to apply moderate remedies;
such as might punish some with exemplary justice, yet disarm others, with
tenders of mercy upon their submission* and our protection of them, from the
fury of those, who would soon drown them, if they refused to swim down the
popular stream with them; But some kind of Zeal counts all merciful moderation,
luke-warmnesse; and had rather be cruel then counted cold, and is not seldom
more greedy to kill the Bear for his skin, then for any harm he has done. The
confiscation of men's estates being more beneficial, then the charity of saving
their lives, or reforming their Errors.

When all proportionable succors of the poor Pretestants in Ireland (who were
daily massacred, and over-borne with numbers of now desperate Enemies) were
diverted and obstructed here; I was earnestly entreated, and generally advised
by the chief of the Protestant Party there, to get them some respite and
breathing by a cessation, without which they saw ^o probability (unless by
miracle) to preserve the remnant that had yet escaped: Go knows with how much
commiseration and sol^citous caution I carried on that bnsinesse, by persons of
Honor and Integrity, that so I mig^ neither encourage the rebels Insolence,
nor discourage the Protestants loyalty and patience.

Yet when this was effected in the best so^ that the necessity and difficulty
of affairs would then permit, I was then to suffer again in m^ reputation and
Honor, because I suffered n^ the Rebels utterly to devour the remaini^
handfulls of the Protestants there.

I thought, that, in all reason, the gaining (...) that respite could not be so
much to the Rebe^ advantages (which some have highly calumni^ted against me) as
it might have been for t^ Protestants future, as well as present safety; during
the time of that Cessation, some men h^ had the grace to have laid Irelands sad
conditio more to heart; and laid aside those violent m^tions, which were here
carried on by those, the had better skill to let blood then to stanch it.

But in all the misconstructions of my actio^ (which are prone to find more
credulity in m^ to what is false and evil, than love or charity (...) what is
true and good) as I have no Judge (...) God above me, so I can have comfort to
app^ to his omniscience, who does not therefo^ deny my Innocence, because he is
pleased* far to try my patience, as he did his servant Iob^

I have enough to do to look to My own Conscience, and the faithful discharge
of My Trust as a KING; I have scarce leisure to consider those swarms of
reproaches, which issue out of some men's mouths and hearts, as easily as smoke,
or sparks do out of a Furnace; Much less to make such prolix Apologies, as
might give those men satisfaction, who, conscious to their own depth of
wickedness, are loath to believe any man not to be as bad as themselves.

It Is Kingly to do well, and hear ill: If I can but act the one, I shall not
much regard to bear the other.

I thank God I can hear with patience, as bad as my worst enemies can falsely
say. And I hope I shall still do better than they desire, or deserve I should.

I believe it will at last appear, that they who first began to embroyle my
other Kingdoms, are in great part guilty, if not of the first letting out, yet
of the not-timely stopping those horrid effusion of blood in Ireland.

Which (what ever my Enemies please to say, or think) I look upon, as that of
my other Kingdoms, exhausted out of my own veins; no man being so much weakened
by it, as my self; And I hope, though men's unsatiable cruelti^s never will* yet
the mercy of God will at length say to his justice, It is enough: and command
the sword of civil wars to sheath it self: his merciful justice intending I
trust not our utter confusion; but our cure; the abatement of our sins, or the
desolating of these Nations.

O my God, let those infinite mercies prevent us once again, which I and my
Kingdoms have formerly abused, and can never deserve should be restored.

Thou see how much cruelty among Christians is acted under the color of
Religion; as if we could not be Christians, unless we crucify one another.
Because we have not more loved thy Truth, and practiced in Charity, thou have
suffered a Spirit of Error and bitterness, of mutual and mortal hatred to
rise among us.

O Lord, forgive wherein we have sinned, and sanctify what we have suffered.

Let our repentance be our recovery, as our great sins have been our ruin.

Let not the miseries I and my Kingdoms have hitherto suffered seem small to
thee: but make our sins appear to our consciences, as they are represented in
the glass of thy judgments; for thou never punishest small failings with so
severe afflictions.

O therefore, according to the multitude of thy great mercies, pardon our
sins, and remove thy judgments which are very many, and very heavy.

Yet let our sins be evermore grievous to us, tha^ thy Judgments; and make
us more willing to repent, then to be relieved; first, give us the peace of
penitent consciences, and then the tranquillity of united Kingdoms.

In the Sea of our Saviors blood drown our sins, and throngh this red Sea
of our own blood bring us at last to a state of piety, peace, and plenty.

As my public relations to all, make me share in all my Subjects sufferings;
so give me such a pious sense of them, as becomes a Christian King, and a
loving Father of my people.

Let the scandalous and unjust reproaches cast upon me, be as a breath, more to
kindle my compassion: Give me grace to heap charitable coals of fire upon
their heads to melt them, whose malice or truell Zeal has kindled, or hindered
the quenching of those flames, which have so much wasted my three Kingdoms.

O rescue and assist those poor Protestants in Ireland, whom thou have
hitherto preserved.

And lead those in the ways of thy saving Truths, whose ignorance or errors
have filled them with Rellellious and destructive principles; which they act
under an opinion, That they do thee good service.

Let the hand of thy Justice be against those, who maliciously and dispitefully
have raised, or fomented those cruel and desperate Wars.

Thou that art far from destroying the Innocent with the Guilty, and the
Erroneous with the Malicious; Thou that had pity on Niniveh for the many
Children that were therein, give not over the whole stock of that populous and
seduced Nation, to the wrath of those, whose covetousness makes them cruel;
nor to their anger, which is too fierce, and therefore justly cursed.

Preserve, if it be thy will, in the midst of the furnace of thy severe justice
a Posterity, which may praise thee for thy mercy.

And deal with Me, not according to man's unjust reproaches, but according to
the innocence of my hands in thy sight.

If I have desired, or delighted in the woeful day of my Kingdoms calamities;
if I have not earnestly studied, and faithfully endeavored the preventing and
composing of these bloody distractions; then let thy hand be against me, and my
Fathers house.

O Lord, thou see I have enemies enough of men as I need not, so I should not
dare thus to imprecate thy curse on me and mine, if my Conscience did not
witness my integrity, which thou, O Lord, know right will; But I trust not
to My own merit, but thy mercies; spare us O Lord, and be not angry with us for
ever.

13 Upon the Calling in of the Scots, and their Coming.
THe Scots are a Nation, upon whom I have not only common ties of Nature,
Sovereignty, and Bounty, with My Father of blessed memory; but also special and
late obligations of favors, having gratified the active Spirits, among them so
far, that I seemed to many, to prefer the desires of that party, before my own
interest and Honor. But, I see, Royal bounty emboldens some men to ask, and
act beyond all bounds of modesty and gratitude.

My charity, and Act of Pacification, forbids me to reflect on former passages;
wherein I shall ever be far from letting any man's ingratitude, or
inconstancy, make Me repent of what I granted them, for the public good: I
pray God it may so prove.

The coming again of that Party into England, with an Army, only to conform
this Church to their late New model, cannot but seem as unreasonable, as they
would have thought the same measure offered from hence to themselves.

Other errand I could never understand they had, (besides those common and
vulgar flourishes for Religion and Liberty) save only to confirm the
Presbyterian Copy they had set, by making this Church to write after them,
though it were in bloody Characters.

Which design and end, whether it will justify the use of such violent means,
before the divine Justice, I leave to their Consciences to judge, who have
already felt the misery of the means, but not reaped the benefit of the end,
either in this Kingdom, or that.

Such knots and crosnesse of grain being objected here, as will hardly suffer
that form, which they cry up as the only just reformation, and settling of
Government and Discipline in Churches, to go on so smoothly here, as it might
do in Scotland; and was by them imagined would have done in ENGLAND, when so
many of the English Clergy, through levity or discontent, if no worse passion,
suddenly quitted their former engagements to Episcopacy, and faced about to
their Presbytery.

It cannot but seem either passion, or some self-seeking, more then true Zeal,
and pious Discretion, for any foreign State or Church to prescribe such
medicines only for others, which themselves have used, rather successefully
than commendably; not considering that the same Physic on different
constitutions, will have different operations; That may kill one, which does
but cure another.

Nor do I know any such tough and malignant humors in the constitution of the
English Church, which gentler applications then those of an Army, might not
easily have removed: Nor is it so proper to hew out religious Reformations by
the Sword, as to polish them by fair and equal disputations among those that
are most concerned in the diferences; whom not force, but Reason ought to
convince.

But their design now seemed rather to cut of all disputation here, than to
procure a fair and equal one: For, it was concluded, there, that the English
Clergy must conform to the Scots pattern, before ever they could be heard, what
they could say for themselves, or against the others way.

I could have wished fairer proceedings both for their credits, who urge things
with such violence; and for other men's Consciences too, who can receive little
satisfaction in these points which are maintained rather by Soldiers fighting
in the Field, than Scholars disputing in free and learned Synods.

Sure, in matters, of Religion those truths gain most on men's Judgments and
Consciences, which are least urged with secular violence, which weakens Truth
with prejudices; and is unreasonable to be used, till such means of rational
conviction has been applied, as, leaving no excuse for ignorance, condemns
men's obstinacy to deserved penalties.

Which no charity will easily suspect of so many learned and pious Churchmen
in England; who being always bred up, and conformable to the Government of
Episcopacy, cannot so soon renounce both their former opinion and practice,
only because that Party of the Scots will needs, by force, assist a like Party
here, either to drive all Ministers, as sheep into the common fold of
Presbytery, or destroy them; at least fleece them* by depriving them of the
benefit of their Flocks. If the Scotch sole Presbytery were proved to be the
only institution of Jesus Christ, for all Churches Government, yet I believe it
would be hard to prove that Christ had given those Scots, or any other of my
Subjects, Commission, by the sword to set up in any of My Kingdoms without My
Consent.

What respect and obedience Christ and his Apostls pai'd to the chief
Governors of States, where they lived is very clear in the Gospel; but that
he, or they ever commanded to set up such a parity of Presbyters, and in such a
way as those Scots endeavor, I think is not very disputable.

If Presbytery in such a supremacy be an institution of Christ, sure it differs
from all others; and is the first and only point of Christianity, that was to
be planted and watered with so much Christian blood; whose effusions run in a
stream so contrary to that of the primitive Planters, both of Christianity and
Episcopacy, which was with patient shedding of their own blood, not violent
drawing other men's; sure there is too much of Man in it, to have much of
Christ, none of whose institutions were carried on, or begun with the
Temptations of Covetousness or Ambition; of both which this is vehemently
suspected. Yet was there never any thing upon the point, which those Scots had
by Army or Commissioners to move me with, by their many Solemn obtestations,
and pious threatenings, but only this; to represent to me the wonderful
necessity of setting up their Presbytery in England, to avoid the further
miseries of a War; which some men chiefly on this design at first had begun,
and now further engaged themselves to continue*

What hinders that any Sects, Schisms, or Heresies, if they can get but
numbers, strength and opportunity, may not, according to this opinion and
pattern, set up their ways by the like methods of violence? all which
Presbytery seeks to suppres, and render odious under those names; when wise and
learned men think, that nothing has more marks of Schism, and Sectarisme,
then this Presbyterian way* both as to the Ancient, and still most Universal
way of the Church Government, and specially as to the particular Laws and
Constitutions of this English Church, which are not yet repealed, nor are like
to be for me, till I see more Rational and Religious motives, then soldiers
use to carry in their Knapsacks.

But we must leave the success of all to God, who has many ways (having
first taken us off from the folly of our opinions, and fury of our passion) to
teach us those rules of true Reason, and peaceable wisdom, which is from above,
tending most to Gods glory, and his Churches good; which I think my self so
much the more bound in Conscience to attend, with the most judicious Zeal and
care, by how much I esteem the church above the State, the glory of Christ
above mine Own; and the salvations of men's souls above the presevation of their
Bodies and Estates.

Nor may any men, I think, without sin and presumption, forcibly endeavor to
cast the Churches under my care and tuition, into the moulds they have fancied,
and fashioned to their designs, till they have first gained my consent, and
resolved both my own and other men's Consciences by the strength of their
reasons.

Other violent motions, which are neither Manly, Christian, nor Loyal, shall
never either shake or settle my religion; nor any man's else, who knows what
Religion means; and how far it is removed from all Faction, whose proper
engine is force; the arbitrator of beasts, no^ of reasonable men, much less of
humble Christians, and loyal Subjects, in matters of religion.

But men are prone to have such high conceits of themselves, that they care not
what cost they lay out upon their opinions; especially those, that have some
temptation of gain, to recompense their losses and hazards.

Yet I was not more scandalized at the Scots Armies coming in against my will,
and their forfeiture of so many obligations of duty, and gratitude to me; then
I wondered, how those here could so much distrust Gods assistance; who so much
pretended Gods cause to the People, as if they had the certainty of some divine
Revelation; considering they were more then competently furnished with my
Subjects Arms and Ammunition; My Navy by Sea, my Forts, Castls, and Cities by
Land.

But I find, that men jealous of tue Jnstifiablenesse of their doings. and
designs before God. never think they have hnmane strength enough to carry
their work on, seem it never so plausible to the People; what cannot be
justified in Law or Religion, had need be fortified with Power.

And yet such is the inconstancy that attends all minds engaged in violent
motion, that whom some of them one while earnestly invite to come into their
assistance, others of them soon after are weary of, and with nauseating cast
them out: what one Party thought to rivet to a setlednesse by the strength and
influence of the Scots, that the other rejects and contemnes at once, despising
the Kirk Government, and ^iscipline of the Scots, and frustrating the success
of so chargable, more then charitable assistance: For, sure the Church of
England might have purchased, at a far cheaper rate, the truth and happiness
of Reformed government and discipline (if it had been wanting) though it had
entertained the best Divines of Christendom for their advice in a full and
free Synod; which I was ever willing to, and desirous of, that matters being
impartially settled, might be more satisfactory to all, and more durable.

But much of Gods justice, and man's folly will at length be discovered, through
all the filmes and pretensions of Religion, in which Politicians wrap up their
designs; In vain do men hope to build their piety on the ruins of Loylty.
Nor can those confederations or designs (...) durable, when Subjects make
bankrupt of their Allegiance, under pretense of setting up a quicker trade for
Religion.

But, as my best Subjects of Scotland never deserted Me, so I cannot think that
the most are gone so far from Me, in a prodigality of their love and respects
toward Me, as to make Me to despair of their return; when, besides the bonds of
nature and Conscience, which they have to Me, all Reason and true policy will
teach them; that their chiefest interest consists in their fidelity to the
Crown, not in their serviceablenesse to any party of the People, to a neglect
and betraying of My Safety and Honor for their advantages: However, the less
cause I have to trust to men, the more I shall apply my self to God.

The Troubles of My Soul are enlarged, O Lord, bring thou Me out of My
distress.

Lord direct thy Servant in the ways of that pious simplicity, which is the
best policy.

Deliver Me from the combined strength of those, who have so much of the
Serpents subtilty, that they forget the Doves Innocence.

Though hand join in hand, yet let them not prevail against My soul, to the
betraying of My Conscience and Honor.

Thou, O Lord, can turn the hearts of th^se Parties in both Nations, as thou
did the men of Judah and Israel, to restore David with as much loyal Zeal,
as they did with inconstancy and eagerness pursve him.

Preserve the love of thy Truth, and uprightnes in me, and I shall not despair
of My Subjects affections returning toward me.

Thou can soon cause the overflowing Seas to ebb, and retire back again to
the bounds which thou have appointed for them.

O my God, I trust in thee; let me not be ashamed; let not my Enemies triumph
over me.

Let them be ashamed who transgress without a cause; let them be turned back
that persecute my Soul.

Let integrity and uprightness preserve me, for I wait on thee, O Lord.

Redeem thy Church, O God, out of all its Troubles.

14* Upon the Covenant,
THe Presbyterian Scots are not to be hired at the ordinary rate of Auxiliarie;
nothing will induce them to engage, till those that call them in, have pawned
their Souls to them, by a Solemn League and Covenant.

Where many engines of religious and fair pretensions are brought chiefly to
batter, or raze Episcopacy. This they make the grand evil Spirit, which, with
some other Imps purposely added, to make it more odious, and terrible to the
Vulgar, must by so solemn a charm and exorcisme be cast out of this Church,
after more than a thousand years possession here, from the first plantation of
Christianity in this Island, and an universal prescription of time and
practice in all other Churches since the Apostles times till this last Century

But no Antiquity must plead for it. Presbytery; like a young Heyr, thinks the
Father has lived long enough; and impatient not to be in the Bishops Chair and
Authority (though Laymen go away with the Revenues) all art is used to sink
Episcopacy, and lanch Presbytery in England; which was lately boyed up in
Scotland by the like artifice of a Covenant

Although I am unsatisfyed with many passages in that covenant (some referring
to My self with very dubious and dangerous limitations yet I chiefly wonder at
the design and drift touching the Discipline and Government of the Church; and
such a manner of carrying them on to new ways, by Oaths and Covenants, where it
is hard for men to be engaged by no less, then swearing for, or against those
things, which are of no clear moral necessity, but very disputable, and
controverted among learned and godly men: whereto the application of Oaths can
hardly be made and enjoined with that judgment, and certainty in ones self, or
that charity and candor to others of different opinion, as I think Religion
requires, which never refuses fair and equable deliberations; yea, and
dissentings too, in matters only probable. The enjoining of oaths upon people
must needs in things doubtful be dangerous, as in things unlawful, damnable;
and no less superfluous, where former religious and legal Engagements bound
men sufficiently, to all necessary duties. Nor can I see how they will
reconcile such an Innovating Oath and Covenant, with that former protestation
which was so lately taked, to maintain the Religion established in the Church
of England: since they count Discipline so great a part of Religion.

But ambitious minds never think they have laid snares and ginnes enough to
catch and hold the Vulgar credulity: for by such politic and seemingly-pious
stratagems, they think to keep the populacy fast to their Parties under the
terror of perjury: Whereas certainly all honest and wise men ever thought
themselves sufficiently bound, by former ties of Religion, Allegiance, and Laws,
to God and Man.

Nor can such after-Contracts, devised and imposed by a few Men in a declared
Party, without My Consent, and without any like power or precedent from Gods or
man's laws, be ever thought by judicious men sufficient either to absolve or
slacken those moral and eternal bounds of duty which lie upon all My Subjects
consciences both to God and Me. Yet, as things now stand, good men shall lest
offend God or Me, by keeping their Covenant in honest and lawful ways; since I
have the charity to think, that the chief end of the Covenat, in such men's
intentions, was, to preserve Religion in purity, and the kingdoms in peace: To
other then such ends and means they cannot think themselves engaged; nor will
those, that have any true touches of Conscience, endeavor to carry on the best
designs (much less such as are, and will be daily more apparently factious
and ambitious) by any unlawful means, under that title of the Covenant:
unless they dare prefer ambiguous, dangerous, and un-authorized novelties,
before their known and sworn duties, which are indispensable, both to God and
My self.

I am prone to believe and hope, That many, who took the Covenant, are yet firm
to this judgment, That such later Vows, Oaths, or Leagues, can never blot out
those form^r gravings, and characters which by just and lawful Oaths were made
upon their Soul, That which makes such Confederations by way of solemn leagues
and covenants more to be suspected, is, that they are the common road used in
all factions and powerful perturbations, of State or Church: where formalities
of extraordinary zeal and piety are never more studied and elaborate, then,
when Politicians most agitate desperate designs against all that is settled, or
sacred in Religion, and Laws, which by such scrues are cunningly, yet forcibly,
wrested by secret steps, and less sensible degrees, from their known rule and
wonted practice, to comply with the humors of those men, who aim to subdue all
to their own will and power, under the disguises of Holy Combinations.

Which cords and wythes will hold men's Consciences no longer, then force
attends and twists them: for every man soon grows his own Pope, and easily
absolves himself of those ties, which, not the commands of Gods word, or the
Laws of the Land, but only the subtilty and terror of a Party casts upon him;
either superfluous and vain, when they were sufficiently tied before; or
fraudulent and injurious, if by such after-ligaments they find the Imposers
really aiming to dissolve, or suspend their former, just, and necessary
obligations.

Indeed, such illegal ways seldom, or never, intend the engaging men more to
duties, but only to Parties; therefore it is not regarded how they keep their
Covenants in point of piety pretended, provided they adhere firmly to the Party
and Design intended.

I see the Imposers of it are content to make their Covenant like Manna (not
that it came from heaven, as this did) agreeable to every man's palate and
relish, who will but swallow it: They admit any men's senses of it, though
diverse or contrary; with any salvoes, cautions, and reservations, so as they
cross not their chief Design which is laid against the Church, and Me. It is
enough if they get but the reputation of a seeming increase to their Party; So
little do men remember that God is not mocked.

In such latitudes of sense, I believe many that love Me, and the Church well,
may have taken the Covenant, who yet are not so fondly and superstitiously
taken by it, as now to act clearly against both all piety and loyalty; who
first yeil^ed to it, more to prevent that imminent violence and ruin, which
hung over their heads, in case they wholly refused it, than for any value of
it, or devotion to it.

Wherein, the latitude of some general Clauses may (perhaps) serve somewhat to
relieve them, as of Doing and endeavoring what lawfully they may, in their
Places and Callings, and according to the Word of God: for, these (indeed)
carry no man beyond those bounds of good Conscience, which are certain and
fixed, either in Gods Laws, as to the general; or the Laws of the State and
Kingdom, as to the particular regulation and exercise of men's duties.

I would to God, such, as glory most in the name of Covenanters, would keep
themselves within those lawful bounds, to which God has called them: Surely
it were the best way to expiate the rashness of taking it: which must needs
then appear, when besides the want of a full and lawful Authority at first to
enjoyne it, it shall actually be carried on beyond and against those ends which
were in it specified and pretended. I willingly forgive such men's taking the
Covenant, who keep it within such bounds of Piety, Law, and Loyalty, as can
never hurt either the Church, My self, or the Public Peace: Against which;
no man's lawful Calling can engage him.

As for that Reformation of the Church, which the Covenant pretends, I cannot
think it just or comely, that by the partial advice of a few Divines, (of so
soft and servile tempers, as disposed them to so sudden acting and compliance,
contrary to their former judgments, profession and practice) such foul
scandalls and suspicions should be cast upon the Doctrine and Government of the
Church of England, as was never done (that I have heard) by any that deserved
the name of Reformed Churches abroad, nor by any men of learning and candor,
at home: all whose judgments I cannot but perfer before any men's now factiously
engaged.

No man can be more forward than My self to carry on all due Reformations,
with mature judgment, and a good Conscience, in what things I shall (after
impartial advise) be, by Gods Word, and right reason, convinced to be amiss,
I have offered more than ever the fullest, freest, and wisest Parliaments did
desire.

But the sequel of some men's actions makes it evident, that the main
Reformation intended, is the abasing of Episcopacy into Presbytery, and the
robbing the Church of its Lands and Revenues: For, no men have been more
injuriously used, as to their legal Rights than the Bishops and Churchmen.
These, as the fattest Deer, must be destroyed; the other Rascal-herd of
Schisms, Heresies, etc. being lean, may enjoy the benefit of a Toleration*
Thus Naboth's Vineyard made him the only Blasphemer of this City, and fit to
die. Still I see, while the breath of Religion fills the Sails, Profit is the
Compass, by which Factious men steer their course in all seditious Commotions.

I thank God, as no man lay more open to the sacrilegious temptation of
usurping the Churches Lands, and Revenues, (which issuing chiefly from the
Crown, are held of it, and legally can revert only to the Crown, with My
Consent) so I have always had such a perfect abhorrence of it in My Soul,
that I never found the least inclination to such sacrilegious Reformings: yet
no man has a greater desire to have Bishops and all Churchmen so reformed,
that they may best deserve and use, not only what the pious munisicence of My
Predecessors has given to God and the Church, but all other additions of
christian bounty.

But no necssity shall ever, I hope, drive Me or Mine to invade or sell the
Priests Lands, which both Pharaoh's divinity, and Ioseph's true piety abhorred
to do: So unjust I think it both in the eye of Reason and Religion, to deprive
the most sacred employment of all due encouragements; and like that other
hardhearted Pharaoh, to withdraw the straw, and increase the Task; so pursuing
the oppressed Church, as some have done, to the read sea of a Civil War,
where nothing but a miracle can save either It, or Him, who esteems it His
greatest Title to be called, and His chiefest glory to be The Defender of the
Church, both in its true faith and its just fruitions, equally abhorring
Sacrilege and Apostasy,

I had rather live as My Predecessor HENRY 3 sometime did; on the Churches
Alms, then violently to take the bread out of Bishops and Ministers mouths.

The next work will be Ieroboam's reformation, consecrating the meanest of the
People to be Priests in Israel, to serve those Golden Calves, who have enriched
themselves with the Churches Patrimony and Dowry; which how it thrived both
with Prince, Priests, and People, is well enough known: And so it will be
here, when from the tuition of Kings and Queens, which have been nursing
Fathers and Mothers of this Church, it shall be at their alowance, who have
already discovered, what hard Fathers, and Stepmothers they will be.

If the poverty of Scotland might, yet the plenty of England, cannot excuse the
envy and rapine of the Churches Rights and Revenues.

I cannot so much as pray God to prevent those sad consequences, which will
inevitably follow the parity and poverty of Ministers, both in Church and
State; since I think it no less than a mocking and tempting of God, to desire
him to hinder those mischiefs, whose occasions and remedies are in our own
power; it being every man's sin not to avoid the one, and not to use the other.

There are ways enongh to repair the breaches of the State without the ruins
of the Church; as I would be a Restorer of the one, so I would not be an
oppressor of the other, under the pretense of Publiqu^ Debts: The occasions
contracting them were bad enough, but such a discharging of them would be much
worse; I pray God neither I, nor Mine, may be accessory to either.

To thee, O Lord, do I address My prayer, beseeching thee to pardon the
rashness of My Subjects Swearings, and to quicken their sense and observation
of those just, moral, and indispensable bonds, which thy Word, and the Laws
of this Kingdom have laid upon their Consciences; From which no pretensions of
Piety and Reformation are sufficient to absolve them, or to engage them to any
contrary practices.

Make them at length seriously to consider, that nothing violent and injurious
can be religious.

Thou allowest no man's committing Sacrilege under the Zeal of abhorring Idols.

Suffer not sacrilegious designs to have the Countenance of religious ties.

Thou have taught us by the wisest of Kings, that it is a snare to take things
that are holy, and after V^ws to make enquiry.

Ever keep thy servant from consenting to periurious and sacrilegious rapines,
that I may not have the brand and curse to all posterity of robbing Thee and
thy Church, of what thy bounty has given us, and thy clemency has accepted
from us, wherewith to encourage Learning and Religion.

Though My Treasures are Exhausted, My Revenues Diminished; and My Debts
Increased, yet never suffer Me to be tempted to use such profane Reparations;
lest a coal from thine altar set such a fire on My Throne and Conscience as
will be hardly quenched.

Let not the Debs and Engagements of the Public, which some men's folly and
prodigality has contracted, be an occasion to impoverish thy Church.

The State may soon recover, by thy blessing of peace upon us; The Church is
never likely in times, where the Charity of most men is grown so cold, and
their Religion so illeberall.

Continne to those that serve Thee and thy Church all those encouragements,
which by the will of the pious Donours, and the Justice of the Laws are due
unto them; and give them grace to deserve and us^ them aright to thy glory, and
the releif of the poor; That thy Priests may be clothed with righteousness,
and the poor may be satisfied with bread.

Let not holy things be given to Swine; nor the Churches bread to Dogs; rather
let them go about the City, grin like a Dog, and grudg that they are not
satisfied,

Let those sacred morsells, which some men have already by violence devoured,
never digest with them, nor theirs; Let them be as Naboth's Vineyard to Ahab,
gall in their mouths, rottenness to their mames, a moth to their Families, and
a sting to their Consciences.

Break in sunder, O Lord, all violent and sacrilegious Confederations, to do
wickedly and in^uriously.

Divide their hearts and tongues who have bandyed together against the Church
and State, that the folly of such may be manifest to all men, and proceed no
further.

But so favor My righteous dealing, O Lord, that in the mercies of thee, the
most High, I may never miscarry.

15. Upon the many Jealousies raised, and Scandals cast upon the King, to stir
up the People against Him*
IF I had not My own Innocence, and Gods protection, it were hard for Me to
stand out against those stratagems and conflicts of malice, which by Falsities
seek to oppress the Truth; and by Jealousies to supply the defect of Real
causes, which might seem to justify so unjust Engagements against Me.

And indeed, the worst effects of open Hostility come short of these Designs:
For, I can more willingly lose My Crowne^, than My Credit; nor are My Kingdoms,
so dear to Me, as My Reputation and Honor.

Those must have a period with My life; but these may survive to a glorious
kind of Immortality, when I am dead and gone: A good name being the embalming of
Princes, and a sweet consecrating of them to an Eternity of love and gratitude
among Posterity.

Those foul and false aspersions were secret engines at first employed against
My peoples love of Me: that undermining their opinion and value of Me, My
enemies; and theirs too might at once blow up their affections, and batter down
their loyalty.

Wherein yet, I thank God, the detriment of My Honor is not so afflictive to
Me, as the sin and danger of My peoples souls, whose eye once blinded with such
mists of suspicions, they are soon misled into the most desperate precipices
of actions: wherein they do not only, not consider their sin and danger, but
glory in their zealous adventures; while I am rendered to them so fit to be
destroyed, that many are ambitious to merit the name of My Destroyers;
imagining they then fear God most, when they least honor their King.

I thank God, I never found but My pity was above My anger; nor have My
passions ever so prevailed against Me, as to exclude My most compassionate
prayres for them, whom devout errors more than their own malice have betrayed
to a most religious Rebellion.

I had the Charity to interpret, that most pa^^ of My Subjects fought against
My supposed errors, not My Person; and intended to mend Me, not to end Me: And
I hope that God, pardoning their Errors, has so far accepted and answered
their good intentions, that as he has yet preserved Me, so he has by these
afflictions prepared Me, both to do him better service, and My people more
good, than hitherto I hav^don.

I do not more willingly forgive their seductions, which occasioned their
loyal injuries then I am ambitious by all Princely merits to redeem them from
their unjust suspicions, and reward them for their good intentions.

I am too conscious to My own Affections toward the generality of My people, to
suspect theirs to Me; nor shall the malice of My Enemies ever be able to
deprive Me of the comfort, which that confidence gives Me; I shall never
gratify the spightfulnesse of a few with any sinister thoughts of all their
Allegiance, whom pious frauds have seduced.

The worst some men's ambition can do, shall never persuade Me, to make so bad
interpretations of most of My Subjects actions; who possibly may be Erroneous,
but no^ Heretical in point of Loyalty.

The sense of the Injuries done unto My Subjects is as sharp, as those done to
My self; our welfares being inseparable; in this only they suffer more then
My self, that they are animated by some seducers to injure at once both
themselves and Me.

For this is not enough to the malice of My enemies, that I be afflicted: but
it must be don by such instruments, that My afflictions grieve Me not more,
then this does, that I am afflicted by those, whose prosperity I earnestly
desire, and whose seduction I heartily deplore.

If they had been My open and foreign Enemies, I could have born it; but they
must be My own Subjects, who are, next to My Children; dear to Me: And for the
restoring of whose tranquillity, I could willingly be the Jonah; If I did not
evidently foresee, that by the divided Interests of their and Mine enemies, as
by contrary winds, the storm of their miseries would be rather increased then
allayed.

I had rather prevent my peoples ruin then rule over them; nor am I so
ambitious of that Dominion, which is but My Right, as of their happiness; if
it could expiate or countervaile such a way of obtaining it, by the highest
injuries of Subjects committed against their Sovereign.

Yet I had rather suffer all the miseries of life, and die many deaths, then
shamefully to desert, or dishonourably to betray My own just rights and
Sovereignty; thereby to gratify the ambition, or justify the malice of My
Enemies; between whose malice; and other men mistakes, I put as great a
difference, as between an ordinary AGUE and the PLAGUE; or the Itch of
Novelty, and the Leprosy of Disloyalty.

As Liars need have good Memories, so Malicious Persons need good inventions;
That their calumnies may fit every man's fancy; and what their reproaches want
of truth, they may make up with number and show.

My patience (I thank God) will better serve Me to bear, and My charity to
forgive, then My leisure to Answer the many false Aspersions which some men
have cast upon Me.

Did I not more consider My Subjects Satisfaction, then my own Vindication: I
should never have given the malice of some men that pleasure, as to see Me take
notice of, or remember what they say, or object.

I would leave the Authors to be punished by their own evil manners and seared
Consciences, which will, I believe, in a shorter time then they be aware of,
both confute and revenge all those black and false scandals, which they have
cast on Me; And make the world see, there is as little truth in them, as there
was little worth in the broaching of them; or Civility (I need not say Loyalty)
in the not-suppressing of them; whose credit and reputation, even with the
People, shall ere long be quite blasted by the breath of that same furnace of
popular obloquy and detraction, which they have studied to heat and inflame to
the highest degree of infamy, and wherein they have sought to cast and consume
My Name and Honor.

First, nothing gave Me more cause to suspect and search My own Innocence,
then when I observed so many forward to engage against Me, who had made great
professions of singular piety; For this gave to vulgar minds so bad a
reflection upon Me, and My Cause, as if it had been impossible to adhere to Me,
and not withal part from God; to think or speak well of Me, and not to
Blaspheme Him; so many were persuaded that these two were utterly inconsistent,
to be at once Loyal to Me, and truly Religious toward God.

Not but that I had (I thank God) many with Me, which were both Learned and
Religious (much above that ordinary size, and that vulgar proportion, wherein
some men glory so much) who were so well satisfied in the cause of My
sufferings, that they chose rather to suffer with Me, then forsake Me.

Nor is it strange that so religious Pretensions, as were used against me,
should be to many welminded Men a great temptation to oppose Me; Especially,
being urged by such popular Preachers, as think it no sin to lie for God, and
what they please to call Gods Cause, cursing all that will not curse with them;
looking so much at, and crying up the goodness of the end propounded, that
they consider not the lawfullnesse of the means used, nor the depth of the
mischief, chiefly plotted and intended. The weakness of these men's judgments
must be made up by their clamours and activity.

It was a great part of some men's Religion to scandalize Me and Mine; they
thought theirs could not be true, if they cried not down Mine as false.

I thank God, I have had more trial of his grace, as to the constancy of My
Religion in the Protestant Profession of the Church of England, both abroad,
and at home, than ever they are like to have. Nor do I know any exception, I am
so liable to, in their opinion, as too great a fixednes in that Religion, whose
judicious and solid grounds, both from Scripture, and Antiquity, will not give
My Conscience leave to approve or consent to those many dangerous and divided
Innovations, which the bold Ignorance of some men would needs obtrud upon me,
and my people.

Contrary to those well tried foundations both of Truth, and Order, which men
of far greater Learning, and clearer Zeal, have settled in the Confession and
Constitution of this Church in England; which many former Parliaments in the
most calm, and unpassionate times, have often confirmed; In which I shall ever,
by Gods help, persevere, as believing it has most of Primitive Truth and Order.

Nor did My using the assistance of some Papists, which were my Subjects, any
way fight against My Religion, as some men would needs interpret it: especially
those who least of all men cared whom they employed, or what they said, or did,
so they might prevail. It Is strange that so wise men, as they would be
esteemed, should not conceive, That differences of persuasion in matters of
Religion may easily fall out, where there is the fameness of duty, Allegiance,
and subjection. The first they owe as men, and Christians to God; the second,
they owe to Me in Common, as their King: different professions in point of
Religion, cannot (any more than in Civil Trades) take away the community of
relations either to Parents, or to Princes: And where is there such an Oglio or
medley of various Religions in the world again, as those men entertain in
their service (who find most fault with me) without any scruple, as to the
diversity of their Sects and Opinions?

It was, indeed, a foul and indelible shame, for such as would be counted
Protestants, to enforce Me, a declared Protestant, their Lord and King, to a
necessary use of Papists, or any other, who did but their duty to help Me to
defend My self.

Nor did I more than is lawful for any King, in such exigents to use the aid
of any his Subjects. I am sorry the Papists should have a greater sense of
their Allegiance, than many Protestant professors; who seem to have learned,
and to practice the worst principles of the worst Papists.

Indeed, it had bin a very impertinent and unseasonable scruple in Me, (and
very pleasing no doubt to My enemies) to have been then disputing the points of
different beliefs in My Subjects, when I was disputed with by swords points*
and when I needed the help of My Subjects as men, no less then their prayers
as Christians.

The noise of My Evil Councillors was another useful device for those, who
were impatient any men's counsels but their own, should be followed in Church
or State; who were so eager in giving Me better counsel, that they would not
give Me leave to take it with freedom, as a Man, or honor, as a King; making
their counsels more like a drench that must be powered down, then a draught
which might be fairly and leisurely drank, if I liked it.

I will not justify beyond humane errors and frailties My self, or My
Counselors: They might be subject to some miscariages, yet such as were far
more reparable by second and better thoughts, than those enormous
extravagances, where with some men have now even will dred and almost quite lost
both Church and State.

The event of things at last will make it evident to My Subjects, that had I
followed the worst Couucels, that My worst Counselors ever had the boldness
to offer to Me, or My self any inclination to use; I could not so soon have
brought both Church and State in three flourishing Kingdoms, to such a Chaos
of confusions, and Hell of miseries, as some have done; out of which they
cannot, or will not in the midst of their many great advantages; redeem either
Me or My Subjects.

No men were more willing to complain, than I was to redress what I saw in
Reason was either done or advised amiss; and this I thonght I had done, even
beyond the expectation of moderate men; who were sorry to see me prone even to
injure My self, out of a Zeal to relieve my Subjects.

But other men's insatiable desire of revenge upon Me, My Court, and My Clergy;
has wholly beguiled both Church and State, of the benefit of all My, either
Retractations, or Concessions; and, withal, has deprived all those (now so
zealous Persecutors) both of the comfort and reward of their former pretended
persecutions, wherein they so much gloryed among the vulgar; and which, indeed,
a truly humble Christian will so highly prize, as rather not be relieved, then
be revenged, so as to be bereaved of that Crown of christian Patience, which
attends humble and injured sufferers.

Another artifice used to withdraw My Peoples affections from Me, to their
designs, was, The noise and ostentation of liberty, which men are not more
prone to desire, then unapt to bear in the popular sense, which is to do what
every man likes best.

If the Divinest liberty be to will what men should, and to do what they so
will, according to Reason; Laws, and Religion; I envy not My subjects that
Liberty, which is all I desire to enjoy My self; So far am I from the desire of
oppressing theirs: Nor were those Lords and Gentlemen which assisted Me, so
prodigal of their liberties, as with their Lives and Fortunes to help on the
enslaving of themselves and their posterities.

As to Civil Immunities, none but such as desire to drive on their Ambitious
and Covetous designs over the ruins of Church and State, Prince, Peers, and
People, will never desire greater freedoms then the Laws allow, whose bounds good
men count their Ornament and protection; others, their Menacles and Opression.

Nor is it just any man should expect the reward and benefit of the Law, who
despises its rule and direction, losing justly his safety, while he seeks an
unreasonable liberty.

Time will best inform my Subjects, that those are the best preserver of their
true liberties, who allow themselves the least licentiousness against, or
beyond the Laws.

They will feel it at last to their cost, that it is impossible those men
should be really tender of their Fellow Subjects libertyes, who have the
hardiness to use their King with so severe restraint, against all Laws, both
Divine and Humane, under which; yet, I will rather perish, then complain to
those, who want nothing to complete their mirth, and triumph, but such music.

In point of true conscientious tenderness (attended with humility and meeknes,
not with proud and arrogant activity, which seeks to hatch every Egg of
different opinion to a Faction or Schism) I have often declared, how little I
desire My Laws and Scepter should entrench on Gods Sovereignty, which is the
only King of men's Consciences; and yet he has laid such restraints upon men,
as commands them to be subject for Conscience sake, giving no men liberty to
break the Law established, further then with meeknes and patience, they are
content to suffer the penalties annexed, rather then perturb the public peace.

The truth is, some men thirst after Novelties, others despair to relieve the
necessities of their Fortunes, or satisfy their Ambition, in peaceable times,
(distrusting Gods providence, as well as their own merits) were the secret (but
principal) impulsives to those popular Commotions, by which Subjects have been
discharged to expend much of those plentiful Estates they got and enjoyed
under my government, in peaceable times; which yet must now be blasted with all
the odious reproaches, which impotent malice can invent; and My self exposed to
all those contempts, which may mostdiminish the Majesty of a King, and increase
the ungrateful Insolences of My People.

For Mine Honor, I am well assured, that as mine Innocence is clear before God;
in point of of any calumnies they object; so My reputation shall like the Son
(after Owls and Bats have had their freedom in the night and darker times)
rise and recover it self to such a degree of splendor, as those ferall Birds
shall be greived to behold, and unable to bear. For never were any Princes more
glorious the^ those whom God has suffered to be tried in the furnace of
afflictions, by their injurious subjects.

And who knows but the just and merciful God will do Me good, for some men's
hard, false and evil speeches against Me; wherein they spoke rather what they
wish, than what they believe or know. Nor can I suffer so much in point of
honor, by those rude and scandalous Pamphlets (which like fire, in great
conflagration^, fly up and down to set all places on like flames) than those
men do, who pretending to so much piety, are so forgetful of their duty to God
and Me: By no way ever vindicating the Majesty of their KING against any of
those, who, contrary to the precept of God, and precedent of Angels, speak
evil of dignityes, and bring railing accusations against those, who are
honored with the name of Gods. But it is no wonder, if men not fearing God,
should not Honor their Kings

They will easily contemn such shadows of God, who reverence not that
Supreme, and adorable Majesty; in comparison of whom all the glory of Men and
Angels is but obscurity; yet has he graven such Characters of divine
Authority, and sacred power upon Kings, as none may without sin seek to blot
them out. Nor shall their black veiles be able to hide the shining of My face,
while God gives Me a heart frequently and humbly to converse with him, from
whom alone are all the traditions of true glory and Majesty.

Thou, O Lord, know My reproach, and My dishonor, My Adversaries are all
before thee.

My Soul is among Lions, among them that are set on fire, even the Suns of
Men; whose teeth are spears and arrows, their tongue a sharp sword.

Mine Enemies reproach Me all the day long, and those that are mad against me
are sworn together.

O My God, how long shall the sons of men turn my glory into shame? how long
shall they love vanity, and seek after lies?

Thou have heard the reproaches of wicked men on every side. Hold not thy
peace, least My Enemies prevail against me, and lay mine Honor in the dust.

Thou, O Lord, shall destroy them that speak lies: the Lord will abhor both the
blood thirsty, and deceitful men.

Make my righteousness to appear as the light, and mine innocence to shine
forth as the Sun at noone day.

Suffer not my silence to betray mine innocence, nor my displeasure, my
patience; That after my Saviors example, being reviled, I may not revile
again; and, being cursed by them, I may bless them.

Thou that would not suffer Shimei's tongue to go unpunished, when by thy
judgments on David he might seem to justify his disdainful reproaches, give
me grace to intercede with thy mercy for these my enemies, that the reward of
false and lying tongues, even hot burning coals of eternal fire, may not be
brought upon them.

Let my prayers, and patience, be as water to cool and quench their tongues,
who are already set on fire with the fire of Hell, and tormented with those
malicious flames.

Let me be happy to refute, and put to silence their evill-speaking by
well-doing; and let them enjoy not the fruit of their lips, but of my prayer
for their repentance, and thy pardon.

Teach me David's patience and Hezekiahs devotion, that I may look to thy mercy
through man's malice, and see thy Justice in their sin.

Let Sheba's seditious speeches, Rabsheka's railing, and Shemei's cursing,
provoke, as my humble prayer to thee, so thy renewed blessing toward Me.

Though they curse, do thou bless, and I shall be blessed; and made a blessing
to my people.

That the stone, which some builders refuse, may become the head-stone of the
corner.

Look down from heaven, and save me, from the reproach of them that would
swallow me up.

Hide me in the secret of thy presence, from the pride of man, and keep me from
the strife of tongues.

16. Upon the Ordinance against the Common-Prayer-Booke.
IT is no news to have all Innovations ushered in with the name of Reformations
in Church and State, by those, who, seeking to gain reputation with the Vulgar
for their extraordinary parts and piety, must needs undo whatever was formerly
settled never so well and wisely.

So hardly can the pride of those that study Novelties, allow former times any
share or degree of wisdom or godliness. And because matter of prayer and
devotion to God justly bears a great part in Religion, (being the Souls more
immediate converse with the divine Majesty) nothing could be more plausible to
the peopl than to tell them, They served God amiss in that point. Hence our
public Liturgy or Forms of constant Prayers must be (not amended, in what
upon free and public advice might seem to sober men inconvenient for matter
or manner, to which I should easily consent, but) wholly cashiered and
abolished; and, after many popular contempts offered to the Book, and those
that used it according to their Consciences, and the Laws in force, it must be
crucified by an Ordinance, the better to please either those men, who gloried
in their extemporary veyn and fluency; or others, who, conscious to their own
formality in the use of it, thought they fully expiated their sin of not using
it aright, by laying all the blame upon it, and a total rejection of it as a
dead letter, thereby to excuse the deadness of their hearts. As for the matter
contained in the book, sober and learned men have sufficiently vindicated it
against the cavils and exceptions of those, who thought it a part of piety to
make what profan objections, they could against it, especially for Popery and
Superstition; whereas no doubt, the Liturgy was exactly conformed to the
doctrine of the Church of Engl. and this by all reformed churches is confessed
to be most sound and Orthodox. For the manner of using Set and prescribed
Forms, there is no doubt but that wholesome words being known and fitted to
men's understandings, are soonest received into their hearts, and aptest to
excite and carry along with them judicious and fervent affections.

Nor do I see any reason why Christians should be weary of a wel-composed
Liturgy (as I hold this to be) more than of all other things, wherein the
constancy abates nothing of the excellency and usefulness.

I could never see any Reason, why any Christian should abhor, or be forbidden
to use the same forms of prayer, since he prays to the same God, believes in
the same Savior, professes the same Truths, reads the same Scriptures, has
the same duties upon him, and feels the same daily wants for the most part,
both inward and outward, which are common to the whole Church.

Sure we may as well beforehand know what we pray, as to whom we pray; and in
what words, as to whatsense; when we desire the same things, what hinders we
may not use the same words? our appetite and disgestion too may be good when we
use, as we pray for, our daily bread.

Some men, I hear, are so impatient not to use in all their devotion their own
invention, and gifts, that they not only disuse (as too many) but wholly cast
away and contemn the Lords Prayer; whose great guilt is, that it is the warrant
and original pattern of all set Liturgies, in the Christian Church. I ever
thought that the proud ostentation of men's abilities for invention, and the
vain affectations of variety for expressions, in Public Prayer, or any sacred
Administrations, merits a greater brand of sin, than that which they call
Coldness and Barrenness: Nor are men in those noveltyes less subject to
formal and superficial tempers (as to their hearts) than in the use of
constant Forms, where not the words, but men's hearts are too blame.

I make no doubt but a man may be very formal in the most extemporary variety;
and very fervently devout in the most wonted expressions: Nor is God more a God
of variety, than of constancy: Nor are constant Forms of Prayers more likely to
flat, and hinder the Spirit of prayer, and devotion, than un-premeditated and
confused variety to distract, and lose it.

Though I am not against a grave, modest, discreet, and humble use of Ministers
gifts, even in public, the better to fit, and excite their own, and the
Peoples affections to the present occasions; yet I know no necessity why
private and single abilityes should quite justle out, and deprive the Church of
the joint abilityes and concurrent gift of many learned and godly men; such as
the Composers of the Service book were; who may in all reason be thought to
have more of gifts and graces enabling them to Compose with serious
deliberation and concurrent advise, such Forms of prayers, as may best fit the
churches common want, inform the Hearers understanding; and stir up that
fiduciary and fervent application of their spirits, (wherein consists the very
life and soul of prayer, and that so much pretended Spirit of prayer) than any
private man by his solitary abilities can be presumed to have; which, what they
are many times (even there, where they make a great noise and show) the
affectations, emptiness, impertinency, rudeness, confusions, flatnesse,
levity, obscurity, vain, and ridiculous repititions, the senseless, and
oft-times blasphemous expressions; all these burdened with a most tedious and
intolerable length, do sufficiently convince all men, but those who glory in
that Pharisaick way.

Wherein men must be strangely impudent, and flatterers of themselves, not to
have an infinite shame of what they so do and say, in things of so sacred a
nature, before God and the Church, after so ridiculous, and indeed, profane a
manner.

Nor can it be expected, but that in duties of frequent performance, as
Sacramental administrations, and the like, which are still the same, Ministers
must either come to use their own forms constantly which are not like to be
sound, or comprehensive of the nature of the duty, as Forms of Public
composure; or else they must every time affect new expressions when the subject
is the same; which can hardly be presumed in any man's greatest sufficiencyes
not to want (many times) much of that compleatnesse, order and gravity,
becoming those duties, which by this means are exposed at every celebration to
every Ministers private infirmities, indispositions, errors, disorders, and
defects; both for judgment and expression.

A serious sense of which inconvenience in the Church unavoidably following
every man's several manner of officiating, no doubt, first occasioned the
wisdom and piety of the Ancient churches, to remedy those mischiefs, by the use
of constant Lyturgies of public composure.

The want of which I believe this Church will sufficiently feel, when the
unhappy fruits of many men's un-governed ignorance, and confident defects, shall
be discovered in more errors, scismes, disorders, and uncharitable
distractions in Religion, which are already but too many; the more is the pity.

However, if violence must needs bring in, and abet those innovations, (that
men may not seem to have nothing to do) which Law, Reason, and Religion
forbids, at least to be so obtruded, as wholly to justle out the public Lyturgy.

Yet nothing can excuse that most unjust and partial severity of those men,
who either lately had subscribed to, used and maintained the Service Book; or
refusing to use, it cried out of the rigor of the Laws and Bishops, which
suffered them not to use the liberty of their consciences, in not using it.

That these men (I say) should so suddenly change the Lyturgie into a
Directory, as if the Spirit needed help for invention, though not for
expressions; or as if matter prescribed did not as much stint and obstruct the
Spirit, as if it were clothed in, and confined to, fit words: (So slight and
easy is that Legerdemain which will serve to delude the vulgar.)

That further, they should use such severity as not to suffer, without penalty,
any to use the Common Prayer Book publicly, although their Consciences bind
them to it, as a duty of piety to GOD, and Obedience to the Laws. Thus I see,
no men are prone to be greater Tyrants, and more rigorus exacters upon others
to conform to their illegal novelties, then such, whose pride was formerly
least disposed to the obedience of lawful Constitutions; and whose licentious
humors, most pretended Conscientious liberties; which freedom, with much
regret, they now allow to Me, and My Chaplains, when they may have leave to
serve Me; whose abilities, even in their extemporary way, come not short of the
other* but their modesty and learning far exceeds the most of them.

But this matter is of so popular a nature, as some men knew it would not bear
learned and sober debates, least, being convinced by the evidence of Reason, as
well as Laws, they should have been driven either to sin more against their
knowledge, by taking away the Lyturgy* or to displease some faction of the
people by continuing the use of it.

Though I believe they have offended more considerable men, not only for their
numbers and estate, but for their weighty and judicious piety, than those are,
whose weakness or giddines they sought to gratify by taking it away.

One of the greatest faults some men found with the Common Prayer Book, I
believe, was this, That it taught them to pray so often for Me; to which
Petitions they had not Loyalty enough to say Amen, nor yet charity enough to
forbear Reproaches, and even cursings of Me in their own forms, instead of
praying for Me.

I wish their Repentance may be their only punishment; that seeing the
mischiefs which the disuse of public Liturgyes has already produced, they
may restore that credit, use, and reverence to them, which by the ancient
Churches were given to Set Forms of sound and wholesome words.

And thou, O Lord, which art the same God, blessed for ever: whose mercies are
full of vary y; and yet of constancy; Thou denyest us not a new and fresh
sense of our old and daily wants: nor despisest renewed affections joined to
constant expressions.

Let us not want the benefit of thy Churches united and wel-advised Devotions.

Let the matters of our prayers be agreeable to thy will* which is always the
same; and the fervency of our spirits to the motions of thy holy Spirit in us.

And then we doubt not, but thy spiritual perfections are such, as thou art
neither to be pleased with affected Novelties for matter or manner, nor
offended with the pious constancy of our petitions in them both.

Whose variety or constancy thou have no where either forbidden or commanded,
but left them to the piety and prudence of thy Church, that both may be used,
neither despised.

Keep men in that pious moderation of their Judgments in matters of Religion;
that their ignorance may not offend others, nor their opinion of their own
abilities tempt them to deprive others of what they may lawfully and devoutly
use, to help their infirmities.

And since the advantage of Error consists in novelty and variety, as Truths
in unity and constancy, Suffer not thy Church to be pestered with errors, and
diformed with undecencies in thy service, under the pretense of variety and
novelty. Nor to be deprived of truth, unity, and order, under this fallacy,
That constancy is the cause of formality.

Lord keep us from formal Hypocisie in our own hearts, and then we know that
praying to thee, or praising of thee (with David, and other holy men) in the
same forms cannot hurt us.

Give us wisdom to amend what is amiss within us, and there will be less to
mend without us.

Evermore defend and deliver thy Church from the effects of blind zeal, and
over-bold devotion.

17. Of the differences between the King and the two Houses, in point of
Church Government.
TOuching the GOVERNMENT of the Church by Bishops, the common Jealousy has
bin, that I am earnest and resolute to maintain it, not so much out of piety,
as policy, and reason of State.

Wherein so far indeed reason of State does induce Me to approve that
Government above any other, as I find it impossible for a Prince to preserve
the State in quiet, unless he has such an influence upon Churchmen, and they
such a dependence on Him, as may best restrain the seditions exorbitances of
Ministers Tongues; who with the Keys of Heaven have so far the Keys of the
Peoples hearts, as they prevail much by their Oratory to let in, or shut out,
both Peace and Loyalty.

So that, I being (as King) entrusted by God, and the Laws, with the good both
of Church and State; I see no reason I should give up, or weaken by any change,
that power and influence which in right and reason I ought to have over both.

The moving Bishops out of the House of Peers (of which I have elsewhere given
an account) was sufficient to take off any suspicion, that I incline to them
for any use to be made of their Votes in State affairs: Though indeed I never
thought any Bishop worthy to sit in that House, who would not Vote according to
his Conscience.

I must now in charity be thought desirous to preserve that Government in its
right constitution, as a matter of Religion; wherein both My judgment is
justly satisfied, that it has of all other the fullest Scripture grounds, and
also the constant practice of all Christian Churches; til of late years, the
tumultuarinesse of People, or the factiousnesse and pride of Presbyters, or the
covetousness of some States and Princes, gave occasion to some men's wits to
invent new modells, and propose them under specious titles of Christ's
Government, Scepter, and Kindome; the better to serve their turns, to whom the
change was beneficial.

They must give Me leave, having none of their temptations to invite Me to
alter the Government of Bishops, (that I may have a Title to their Estates) not
to believe their pretended grounds to any new ways: contrary to the full, and
constant testimony of all Histories, sufficiently convincing unbiased men; that
as the Primitive Churches were undoubtedly governed by the Apostls and their
immediate Successors first and best Bishops; so it cannot in reason or charity
be supposed, that al churches in the world should either be ignorant of the
rule by the^ prescribed, or so soon deviate from their divine and holy
pattern: That since the first Age, for 1500. years not one Example can be
produced of any settled Church, wherein were many Ministers and Congregations,
which had not some Bishop above them, under whose jurisdiction and government
they were.

Whose constant and universal practice agreeing with so large, and evident
Scripture-directions, and examples, as are set down in the Epistles to Timothy
and Titus, for the settling of that Government, not in the persons only of
Timothy and Titus, but in the succession; (the want of Government being that,
which the Church can no more dispense with, in point of wel-being, then the
want of the Word and Sacraments, in point of being) I wonder how men came to
look with so envious an eye upon Bishops power and authority, as to oversee
both the Ecclesiastical use of them, and Apostolical constitution: which to
Me seems no less evidently set forth as to the maine scope and design of those
Epistles; for the settling of a peculiar Office, Power, and Authority in them as
President-Bishops above others, in point of Ordination, Censures, and other
acts of Ecclesiastical discipline; then those shorter Characters of the
qualities and duties of Presbiter-Bishops, and Deacons, are described in some
parts of the same Epistles, who in the latitude and community of the name, were
then, and may now not improperly be called Bishops, as to the oversight and
care of single Congregations, committed to them by the Apostles, or those
Apostolical Bishops, who (as Timothy and Titus) succeeded them in that
ordinary power, there assigned over larger divisions, in which were many
Presbyters

The humility of those first Bishops avoiding the eminent title of Apostles, as
a name in the Churches style appropriated from its common notion (of a
Messenger or one sent) to that special dignity which had extraordinary call,
mission, gifts, and power immediately from Christ: they contented themselves
with the ordinary titles of Bishops and Presbyters; until use, (the great
Arbitrator of words, and Master of Language) finding reason to distinguish by a
peculiar name those persons, whose power and office, were indeed distinct from,
and above all other in the Church, as suceeding the Apostles in the ordinary
and constant power of governing the Churches, (the honor of whose name they
moderately, yet commendably declined) all Christian Churches (submitting to
that special anthority) appropriated also the name of Bishop, without any
suspicion or reproach of arrogance, to those who were by apostolical
propagation rightly descended and invested into that highest and largest power
of governing even the most pure and primitive Churches: which, without all
doubt, had many such holy Bishops, after the pattern of Timothy and Titus;
whose special power is not more clearly set down in those Epistles (the chief
grounds and limits of all Episcopal claim, as from divine Right) then are the
Characters of these perilous times, and those men that make them such, who, not
enduring sound doctrine, and clear testimonies of all Churches practice, are
most perverse disputers, and proud Usurpers, against true Episcopacy: who, if
they be not Traitors and Boasters, yet they seem to be very covetous, heady,
high-minded; inordinate and feirce, lovers of themselves, having much of the
form, little of the power of godliness.

Who, by popular heaps of weak, light, and unlearned Teachers, seek to
over-lay and smother the pregnancy and, authority of that power of Episcopal
government, which; beyond al equivocation and vulgar fallacy of names, is most
convincingly set forth, both by Scripture, and all after-Historyes of the
Church.

This I write rather like a Divine, than a Prince that Posterity may see, (if
ever these Papers be public) that I had fair grounds both from
scripture-Canons, and Ecclesiastical examples, whereon My judgment was stated
for Episcopal government. Nor was it any policy of State, or obstinacy of will,
or partiality of affection, either to the men, or their Function which fixed
Me; who cannot in point of worldly respects be so considerable to me as to
recompense the injuries and losses I, and My dearest relations with My
Kingdoms, have sustained, and hazarded, chiefly, at first, upon this quarrel.

And not only in Religion, of which Scripture is the best rule, and the
Churches Universal practice the best commentary, but also in right reason, and
the true nature of Government, it cannot be thought that an orderly
Subordination among Presbyters, or Ministers, should be any more against
Christianity, then it is in all secular and civil Governments, where parity
breeds Confusion and Faction.

I can no more believe, that such order is inconsistent with true Religion,
then good features are with beauty, or numbers with harmony.

Nor is it likely that God, who appointed several orders, and a Prelacy, in
the Government of his Church, among the Jewish Priests, should abhor or forbid
them among Christian Ministers; who have as much of the principles of schism
and division as other men; for preventing and suppressing of which, the
Apostolical wisdom (which was divine) after that Christians were multiplied to
many Congregations, and Presbyters with them, appointed this way of Government,
which might best preserve order and union with Authority.

So that I conceive it was not the favor of Princes, or ambition of
Presbyters, but the wisdom and piety of the Apostles, that first settled
Bishops in the Church; which Authority they constantly used, and enjoyed in
those times, which were purest for Religion, though sharpest for Persecution.

Not that I am against the managing of this presidency and authority in one
man; by the joint Counsel and consent of many Presbyters: I have offered to
restore that, as a fit means to avoid those Errors, Corruptions, and
Partialities, which are incident to any one man; Also to avoid Tyranny, which
becomes no Christians, least of all Churchmen; besides, it will be a means to
take away that burden, and odium of afaires, which may lie too heavy on one
man's shoulders, as indeed I think it formerly did on the Bishops here.

Nor can I see what can be more agreeable both to Reason and Religion, then
such a frame of Government which is paternall, not Magisterial; and wherein not
only the necessity of avoiding Faction and Confusion, Emulations and Cont^mps,
which are prone to rise among equals in power and function* but also the
differences of some Ministers gifts, and aptitudes for Government above others,
does invite to employ them, in reference to those Abilities, wherein they are
eminent. Nor is this judgment of Mine, touching Episcopacy, any pre-occupation
of opinion, which will not admit any oppositions against it: it is well known I
have endeavored to satisfy my self in what the chief Patrons for other ways
can say against this, or for theirs: And I find they have, as sarr less of
Scripture grounds, and of Reason; so for examples, and practice of the Church,
or testimonies of Histories, they are wholly destitute, where in the whose
stream runs so for Episcopacy, that there is not the least rivolet for any
others.

As for those obtruded examples of some late reformed Churches, (for many
retain Bishops still) whom necessity of times and affairs rather excuses,
then commends for their inconformity to all Antiquity; I could never see any
reason why Churches orderly reformed and governed by Bishops should be forced
to conform to those few, rather then to the Catholic example of all Ancient
Churches, which needed no Reformation; and to those Churches at this day, who,
Governed by Bishops in all the Christian world, are many more then
Presbyterians or Independents can pretend to be; All whom the Churches in My
three Kingdoms, lately Governed by Bishops, would equalize (I think) if not
exceed.

Nor is it any point of wisdom or charity, where Christians differ, (as many do
in some points) there to widen the differences, and at once to give all the
Christian world (except a handful of some Protestants) so great a scandal in
point of Church Government; whom though you may convince of their Errors in
some points of Doctrine, yet you shall never persuade them, that to complete
their Reformation, they must necessarily desert, and wholly cast off that
Government, which they, and all before them have ever owned as Catholic,
Primitive, and Apostolical: So far, as never Schismatics, nor Heretics,
(except those Aerians) have strayed from the Unity, and Conformity of the
Church in that point, ever having Bishops above Presbyters.

Besides, the late general approbation and submission to this Government of
Bishops, by the Clergy, as well as the Laity of these Kindoms, is a great
confirmation of My Judgment; and their inconstancy is a great prejudice
against their novelty; I cannot in charity so far doubt of their learning or
integrity, as if they understood not what heretofore they did, or that they did
confirm contrary to their consciences; So that their facility and levity is
never to be excused, who, before ever the point of Church Government had any
free and impartial debate, contrary to their former Oaths and practice,
against their obedience to the Laws in force, and against My consent, have not
only quite cried down the government by Bishops; but have approved and
encouraged the violent and most illegal stripping all the Bishops, and many
other Churchmen, of all their due Authority and Revenues, even to the selling
away, and utter alienation of those church lands from any Ecclesiastical uses:
So great a power has the stream of times, and the prevalency of parties over
some men's judgments; of whose so sudden and so total change little reason can
be given, besides the Scots Army coming into England.

But the folly of these men will at last punish it self, and the Desertors of
Episcopacy will appear the greatest enemies to, and betrayers of their own
interest: for Presbytery is never so considerable or effectual, as when it is
joined to, and crowned with Episcopacy. All Ministers will find as great a
difference in point of thriving, between the favor of the People and of
Princes, as Plants do between being watered by hand, or by the sweet and
liberal dews of Heaven.

The tenuity and contempt of Clergymen will soon let them see, what a poor
carcass they are, when parted from the influence of that Head, to whose
Supremacy they have been sworn.

A little moderation might have prevented great mischiefs; I am firm to
Primitive Episcopacy, not to have it extirpated, (if I can hinder it.)
Discretion without passion might easily reform, whatever the rust of times, or
indulgence of laws or corruption of manners have brought upon it. It being a
gross vulgar error to impute to, or revenge upon the Function the faults of
times, or persons; which seditious and popular principle, and practice all wise
men abhor. For those secular additaments and ornaments of Authority, civil
Honor and Estate, which My Predecessors, and Christian Princes in all countries
have annexed to Bishops and Churchmen, I look upon them but as just rewards of
their learning, and piety, who are fit to be in any degree of
Church Government; also enablements to works of Charity, and Hospitality, meet
strengthenings of their Authority in point of respect, and observance; which in
peaceable times is hardly paid to any Governors by the measure of their
virtues, so much as by that of their Estates; Poverty and meannesse exposing
them and their Authority to the contempt of licentious minds, and manners;
which persecuting times much restrained. I would have such men Bishops, as are
most worthy of those encouragements, and best able to use them: if at any time
my judgment of men failed, My good intention made My error venial: And some
Bishops, I am sure, I had, whose learning, gravity, and piety, no men of any
worth or forehead can deny: But of all men, I would have Churchmen, especially
the Governors to be redeemed from that vulgar neglect, which (besides an
innate principle of vicious opposition, which is in all men against those that
seem to reprove, or restrain them) will necessarily follow both the
Presbyterian party, which makes all Ministers equal; and the Independent
inferiority, which sets their Pastors below the People.

This for My judgment touching Episcopacy; wherein (God knows) I do not
gratify any design or passion with the least perverting of truth.

And now I appeal to God above, and all the Christian world, whether it be just
for Subjects, or pious for Christians; by violence, and infinite indignities,
with servile restraints to seek to force Me their KING and Sovereign, as some
men have endeavored to do, against al these grounds of My Judgment, to consent
to their weak and divided noveltis.

The greatest Pretender of them desires not more then I do, That the Church
should be governed, as Christ has appointed, in true Reason; and in Scripture;
of which I could never see any probable show for any other ways, who either
content themselves with the examples of some Churches in their infancy and
solitude, when one Presbyter might serve one Congregation, in a City or
Country; or else they deny these most evident Truths, That the Apostles were
Bishops over those Presbyters they ordained, as well as over the Churches they
planted; and that Government, being necessary for the Churches wel-being, when
multiplied and sociated, must also necesarily descend from the Apostles to
others, after the example of that power and superiority, they had above others;
which could not end with their persons; since the use and ends of such
Government still continue.

It is most sure, that the purest Primitive and best Churches flourished under
Episcopacy; and may so still, if ignorance, superstition, avarice, revenge, and
other disorderly and disloyal passions had not so blown up some men's minds
against it, that what they want of Reasons or primitive Patterns, they supply
with violence and oppression, wherein some men's zeal for Bishops Lands, Houses,
and Revenues has set them on work to eat up Episcopacy: which (however other
men esteem) to Me is no less sin, then Sacrilege; or a robbery of God (the
giver of all we have) of that portion which devout minds have thankfuly given
again to him, in giving it to his Church and Prophets; through whose hands he
graciously accepts even a cup of cold water, as a libation offered to him-

Furthermore, as to My particular engagement above other men, by an Oath
agreeable to My judgment I am solemnly obliged to preserve that Government, and
the Rights of the Church

Were. I convinced of the unlawfulnes of the Function, as Antichristian, (which
some men boldly but weakly calumniate) I could soon, with Judgment, break that
Oath, which erroneously was taken by Me.

But being daily by the best disquisition of truth, more confirmd in the reason
and Religion of that to which I am Sworn; how can any man that wishes not My
damnation, persuade Me at once to so notorious and combined sins, of Sacriledg
and Perjury? besides the many personal Injustices I must do to many worthy
men, who are as legally invested in the ir Estates, as any, who seek to deprive
the^; and they have by no Law, been convicted of those Crimes, which might
forfeit their estates and livelyhoods.

I have often wondered how men pretending to tenderness of Conscience, and
Reformation, can at once tell Me, that My Coronation Oath binds Me to consent
to whatsoever they shall propound to me, (which they urge with such violence)
though contrary to all that Rational and Religious freedom which every man
ought to preserve; and of which they seem so tender of their own Votes; yet at
the same time these men will needs persuade Me That I must, and ought to
dispense with, and roundly break that part of My Oath, which binds me
(agreeable to the best light of Reason and Religion I have) to maintain the
Government, and legal Rights of the Church. It Is strange My Oath should be
valid in that part, which both My self, and all men in their own case, esteem
injurious and unreasonable, as being against the very natural and essential
liberty of our souls; yet it should be invalid, and to be broken in another
clause, wherein I think my self justly obliged, both to God and Man. Yet upon
this Rack chiefly have I been held so long, by some men's ambitious
covetousness, and Sacrilegious Cruelty; torturing (with Me) both Church and
State, in Civil dissentions; till I shall be forced to consent, and declare
that I do approve, what (God knows) I utterly dislike, and in My Soul abhor
as many ways highly against Reason, Justice, and Religion: and whereto, If I
should shamefully and dishonourably give My consent; yet should I not by so
doing, satisfy the divided Interests and Opinions of those Parties, which
contend with each other, as well as both against Me and Episcopacy.

Nor can My late condesending to the Scots in point of Church Government, be
rightly objected against Me, as an inducement for Me, to consent to the like in
My other Kingdoms; For it should be considered that Episcopacy was not so
rooted and settled there, as it is here; nor I (in that respect) so strictly
bound to continue it in that Kingdom as in this; for what I think in My
judgment best, I may not think so absolutely necessary for all places, and at
all times.

If any shall impute My yielding to them, as My failing and sin, I can easily
acknowledge it, but that is no argument to do so again, or much worse; I being
now more convinced in that point: nor indeed has My yielding to them bin so
happy and successful as to encourage Me to grant the like to others.

Did I see any thing more of Christ, as to Meekness, Justice, Order, Charity,
and Loyalty in those that pretend to other modes of Government, I might suspect
My judgment to be biased, or fore-stalled with some prejudice and wontednes of
opinion; but I have hitherto so much cause to suspect the contrary in the
manners of many of those men, that I cannot from them gain the least reputation
for their new ways of Government. Nor can I find that in any Reformed Churches
(whose paterns are so cried up, and obtruded upon the Churches under My
Dominion) that either Learning, or Religion, works of Piety or Charity, have so
flourished beyond what they have done in My Kingdoms (by Gods blessing) which
might make me believe either Presbytery or Independency have a more benign
influence upon the Church and men's hearts and lives, than Episcopacy in its
right constitution.

The abuses of which, deserve to be extirpated, as much as the use retained;
for I think it far better to hold to primitive and uniform Antiquity, than to
comply with divided novelty.

A right Episcopacy would at once satisfy all just desires and interests of
good Bishops, humble Presbyters, and sober people; so as Church affairs should
be managed neither with tyranny, purity, nor popularity; neither Bishops
ejected, nor Presbiters despised, nor People oppressed.

And in this integrity both of My judgment and Conscience, I hope God will
preserve Me.

For Thou, O Lord, know My uprightness, and tenderness, as thou have set
me to be a Defender of the Faith, and a Protector of thy Church, so susser me
not by any violence, to be overborn against My Conscience.

Arise, O Lord, maintain thine own Cause, let not thy Church be deformed; as
to that Government, which derived from thy Apostles, has been retained in
purest and primitive times, till the Revenues of the Church became the object
of secular envy; which seeks to rob it of all the encouragements of Learning
and Religion.

Make me, as the good Samaritan, compassionate, and helpful to thy afflicted
Church; which some men have wounded and robbed; others pass by without regard,
either to pity, or relieve.

As my power is from thee, so give me grace to use it for thee.

And though I am not suffered to be Master of my other Rights as a KING, yet
preserve me in that liberty of Reason, love of Religion, and thy Churches
welfare; which are fixed in my Censcience as a Christian.

Preserve, from sacrilegious invasions, those temporal blessings, which thy
providence has bestowed on thy Church for thy glory.

Forgive their sins and errors, who have deserved thy just permission, thus
to let in the wild Boar and subtle Foxes, to wast and deforme thy Vineyard,
which thy right hand has planted, and the dew of Heaven so long watered to a
happy and flourishing estate.

O let me not bear the infamous brand to all Posterity of being the the first
Christian KING in this Kingdom, who should consent to the oppressions of thy
Church, and the fathers of it; whose errors I would rather, with Constantine,
cover with silence, and reform with meekness, than expose their persons, and
sacred functions to vulgar contempt.

Thou, O Lord, see how much I have suffered with, and for thy Church; make no
long tarrying O my God, to deliver hoth me, and it, from unreasonable men;
whose counsels have brought forth and continue such violent confusions, by a
precipitant destroying the ancient boundaries of thy Churches peace* thereby
letting in all manner of errors, schisms, and disorders.

O thou God, of order, and of truth, in thy good time, abate the malice, aswage
the rage, and confound all the mischievous devices of thine, mine, and thy
Churches enemies.

That I, and all that love thy Church, may sing praises to thee, and ever
magnify thy salvation, even before the sons of men.

18 Upon Vxbridge-treaty, and other Offers made by the King:
I Look upon the way of Treaties, as a retiring from fighting like Beasts, to
arguing like Men; whose strength should be more in their understandings, than
in their limbs.

And though I could seldom get opportunities to Treat, yet I never wanted
either desire or disposition to it; having greater confidence of My Reason,
than My Sword: I was so wholly resolved to yield to the first, that I thought
neither My self, nor others, should need to use the second, if once we rightly
understood each other.

Nor did I ever think it a diminution of Me, to prevent them with Expresses of
My desires, and even importunities to Treat: It being an office, not only of
humanity, rather to use Reason, than Force; but also of Christianity to seek
peace and ensue it.

As I was very unwillingly compelled to defend My self with Arms, so I very
willingly embraced any thing tending to peace.

The events of all War by the sword being very dubious, and of a Civil War
uncomfortable; the end had hardly recompencing, and late repairing the mischief
of the means.

Nor did any success I had ever, enhance with Me the price of Peace; as
earnestly desired by Me as any man; though I was like to pay dearer for it then
any man: All that I sought to reserve was, Mine Honor, and My Conscience; the
one I could not part with as a KING, the other as a Christian.

The Treaty at Uxbridge gave the fairest hopes of an hapdy composure; had
others applied them selves to it with the same moderation, as I did, I am
confident the War had then ended. I was willing to condescend, as far as
Reason, Honor, and Conscience, would give Me leave; nor were the remaining
difference so essential to My Peoples happiness; or of such consequence as in
the least kind to have hindered My Subjects either security or prosperity; for
they beter enjoyed both, many years, before ever those demands were made, some
of which, to deny, I think the greatest Justice to My self, and favor to My
subjects.

I see, Jealousies are not so easily allayed, as they are raised: Some men are
more afraid to retreat from voilent Engagements than to Engage: what is wanting
in equity, must be made up in pertinacy. Such as had little to enjoy in Peace,
or to lose in war, studied to render the very name of Peace odious and
suspected.

In Church affairs, where I had least liberty of prudence, having so many
strict ties of Conscience upon Me; yet I was willing to condescend so far to
the settling of them, as might have given fair satisfaction to all men, whom
faction, covetousness, or superstition had not engaged more, than any true
zeal, charity, or love of reformation.

I was content to yield to all that might seem to advance true piety; I only
sought to continue what was necessary in point of Order, maintenance, and
Authority to the Churches Government; and what I am persuaded (as I have
elsewhere set down My thoughts more fully) is most agreeable to the true
principles of all Government, raised to its full stature and perfection, as
also to the primitive Apostolical pattern, and the practice of the Universal
Church conform thereto. From which wholly to recede, without any probable
reason urged or answered only to satisfy some men's wills and fantasies (which
yet agree not among themselves in any point but that of extirpating Episcopacy,
fighting against me,) must needs argue such a softnes, and infirmity of mind in
Me, as will rather part with Gods Truth, than Man's peace, and rather lose the
Churches honor, than cross some men's Factious humors.

God knows, and time will discover, who were most too blame for the
un-succesfulness of that Treaty, and who must bear the guilt of
after-calamityes. I believe, I am very excusable both before God, and all
unpassionate men, who have seriously weighed those transactions, wherein I
endeavored no less the restoration of peace to my People, than the
preservation of my own Crowns to my posterity.

Some men have that height, as to interpret all fair Condescendings, as
Arguments of feebleness, and glory most in an unflexible stiffness, when they
see others most supple and inclinable to them.

A grand Maxim with them was always to ask something, which in reason and
honor must be denied, that they might have some color to refuse all that was
in other things granted; setting Peace at as high a rate, as the worst effects
of War; endeavoring first to make Me destroy My self by dishonorable
Concessions, that so they might have the less to do.

This was all which that Treaty, or any other produced, to let the world see,
how little I would deny, or they grant, in order to the publik peace.

That it gave occasion to some men's further restivenesse, is imputable to their
own depraved tempers, not to any Concessions or negations of Mine: I have
always the content of what I offered, and they the regret, and blame, for what
they refused.

The highest tide of success set me not above a Treaty, nor the lowest ebb
below a Fight: Though I never thought it any sign of true valor, to be
prodigal of men's lives, rather then to be drawn to produce our own reasons: or
to subscribe to other men's.

That which made Me for the most part presage the unsuccessefulnes of any
Treaty; was, some men's unwillingnesse to Treat: which employed some things were
to be gained by the Sword, whose unreasonablenes they were loath to have fairly
scanned, being more proper to be acted by Soldiers; than by Councillors. I
pray God forgive them that were guilty of that Treaties breaking; and give them
grace to make their advantages gotten by the the Sword a better opportunity to
use such moderation, as was then wanting; that so though Peace were for our
sins justly deferred, yet at last it may be happily obtained; what we could not
get by our Treaties, we may gain by our prayers.

O Thou, that art the God of Reason, and of Peace, who disd^inest not to Treat
with Sinners, presenting them with offers of atonement; and beseeching them to
be reconciled with thy self, ^ho want not power or Justice, to destroy
them; ^et aboundest in mercy to save: so often our hearts ly the blood of our
Redeemer, and persuade us to accept of Peace with my self, and both to procure
and, preserve peace among our selves, as Men and Christians, How often have I
entreated for Peace, but then I speak thereof, they make them ready to War.

Condemn us not to our passions, which are destructive, both of our selves,
and of others.

Clear up our understandings, to see thy Truth, both in Reason, as Men; and in
Religion, as Christians: and incline all our hearts to hold the unity of the
Spirit, in the bond of Peace.

Take from us that enmity which is now in our hearts against thee: and give us
that charity which should be among our selves.

Remove the evils of War we have deserved, and ^estow upon us that Peace; which
only Christ our great Peace maker cannot merit.

19* Upon the various events of the War; Vistories, and Defeats.
THe various Successes of this unhappy war, have at least, afforded Me variety
of good Meditations: sometimes God was pleased to try Me with victory, by
worsting My Enemies, that I might know how with moderation and thanks to own,
and use his power, who is only the true Lord of Hosts; able when he pleases to
repress the confidence of those, that fought against Me, with so great
advantages for power and number.

From small beginnings on My part he let Me see that I was not wholly forsaken
by My peoples love, or his protection.

Other times God was pleased to exercise My patience, and teach Me not to trust
in the arm of Flesh, but in the living God.

My sins sometimes prevailed against the justice of My Cause, and those that
were with Me wanted not matter and occasion for his just chastisement both of
them, and Me: Nor were My enemies less punished by that prosperity, which
hardened them to continue that injustice by open hostility, which was began by
most riotous and unparliamentary Tumults.

There is no doubt but personal and private sins may often times over-balance
the Justice of Public engagements; nor does God account every gallant Man (in
the worlds esteem) a fit instrument to assert in the way of War a righteous
Cause; The more men are prone to arrogate to their own skill, valor and
strength, the less does God ordinarily work by them for his own glory.

I am sure the event or success can never state the Justice of any Cause, nor
the peace of men's conscinces, nor the eternal fate of their souls.

Those with Me had (I thinke] clearly and undoubtedly, for their Justification
the Word of God, and the Laws of the Land, together with their own Oaths; all
requiring obedience to My just commands; but to none other under Heaven without
Me, or against Me, in the point of raising Arms.

Those on the other side are forced to fly to the shifts of some pretended
Fears and wild fundamentals of State, (as they call them) which actually
overthrow the present fabric, both of Church and State; being such imaginary
Reasons for self-defence as are most impertinent for those men to allege, who
being My Subjects, were manifestly the first assaulters of Me and the Laws:
first by unsuppressed Tumults, after by listed forces; The same allegations
they use, will fit any Faction that has but power and confidence enough to
second with the sword; all their demands against the present Laws and
Governor; which can never be such as some side or other will not find fault
with, so as to urge what they call a Reformation of them to a Rebellion against
them, some parasitick Preachers have dared to call those martyrs, who dyed,
fighting against Me, the Laws, their Oaths, and the Religion Established. But
sober christians know That glorious Title, can with Truth be applied only to
those, who sincerely preferred Gods Truth, and their duty in all these
particulars before their lives, and all that was dear to them in this world;
who having no advantageous designs by any Innovation, were religiously sensible
of those ties to God, the church, and my self which. lay their Souls, both for
obedience and just assistance*

God could, and I doubt not but he did through his mercy, crown many of them
with eternal life, whose lives were lost in so just a Cause* The destruction
of their bodies being sanctified, as a means to save their souls.

Their wounds, and temporal ruin serving as a gracious opportunity for their
eternal health and happiness; while the evident approach of death did,
through Gods grace, effectually dispose their hearts to such Humility, Faith,
and Repentance, which together with the Rectitude of their present engagement,
would fully prepare them for a better life then that, which their enemies
brutish and disloyal fierceness could deprive them of; or without Repentance
hope to enjoy.

They have often indeed, had the better against My side in the field, but
never, I belive, at the Bar of Gods Tribunal, or their own Consciences;
where they are more afraid to encounter those many pregnant Reasons, both from
Law, Allegiance, and all true Christian grounds* which conflict with, and
accuse them in the^ own thoughts, then they often were in a desperate bravery to
fight against those Forces, which sometimes God gave Me.

Whose condition conquered, and dying, ^ make no question, but is infinitely
more to be chosen by a sober man, (that duly values (...) duty, his soul, and
eternity, beyond the enjoyments of this present life) then the most triumphant
glory, wherein their and Mine Enemies supervive; who can hardly avoid to be
daily tormented by that horrid guilt, wherewith their suspicious, or now
convicted Consciences do pursue them, especially since they and all the world
have seen, how false and un-intended those pretensions were, which they first
set forth, as the only plausibl (though not justifiable) grounds of raising a
War, and continuing it thus long against Me, and the Laws established; in whose
^afety and preservation all honest men think the welfare of their Country does
consist.

For, and with all which, it is far more honorable and comfortable to suffer,
then to prosper in their ruin and subversion.

I have often prayed, that all on My side might join true piety with the sense
of their Loyalty; and be as faithful to God and their own souls, as they
were to Me. That the defects of the one might not blast the endeavors of the
other. Yet I cannot think, that any shows, or truth of piety on the other side
were sufficient to dispense with, or expiate the defects of their Duty and
Loyalty to Me, which have so pregnant convictions, on men's consciences, that
even profaner men are moved by the sense of them to venture their lives for me.

I never had any victory which was without My sorrow, because it was on mine
own Subjects, who like Absalom, died many of them in their sin: And yet I
never suffered any defeat, which made Me despair of Gods mercy and defense. I
never desired such Victoryes, as might serve to conquer; but only restore the
Laws and Libertyes of My People; which I saw were extremely oppressed, together
with my Rights by those men, who were impatient of any just restraint.

When Providence gave me, or denied Me Victory; My desire was neither to boast
of My power, nor to charge God foolishly; who I beleved at ^ast would make all
things to work together for my good.

I wished no greater advantages by the War, then to bring My Enemies to
moderation, and my Friends to peace.

I was afraid of the temptation of an absolute conquest, and never prayed more
for victory over others, than over my self. When the first was denied; the
second was granted me, which God saw best for Me. The different events were but
the methods of divine justice, by contrary winds to winnow us: That, by
punishing ou^ sins, he might purge them from us; and by deferring peace, he
might prepare us more to prise and better to use so great a blessing.

My often Messages for Peace showed, that I delighted not in War: as my
former Concessi^ns sufficiently testified, how willingly I would have prevented
it; and My total unpreparedness for it, how little I intended it.

The conscience of my Innocence forbade Me to fear a War; but the love of my
Kingdoms commanded me (if possible) to avoid it.

I am guilty in this War of nothing, but this, That I gave such advantages to
some men, by confirming their power, which they knew not to use with that
modesty, and gratitude, which became their Loyalty and my confidence.

Had I y^ilded less, I had been opposed less; had I denied more, I had been
more obeyed.

It Is now too late to review the occasions of the War: I wish only a happy
conclusion of so unhappy beginnings: The unevitable fate of our sins was (no
doubt) such, as would no longer suffer the divine justice to be quiet: we
having conquered his patience, are condemned by mutual conquerings, to destroy
one another: for, the most prosperous successes on either side, impair the
welfare of the whole.

Those Victories are still miserable, that leave our sins un-subdued;
flushing our pride, and animating to continue injuries.

Peace it fel^ is not desirable, till repentance have prepared us for it.

When we fight more against our selves, and less against God, we shall cease
fighting against one another; I pray God these may all meet in our hearts, and
so dispose us to an happy conclusion of these Civil Wars, that I may know
better to obey God, and govern my People, and they may learn better to obey
both God and me.

Nor do I desire any man should be further subject to me, then all of us may be
subject to God.

O my God, make me content to be overcome, when thou will have it so.

Teach me the noblest victory over my self, and my Enemies by patience; which
was Christ's conquest, and may well become a Christian King.

Between both thy hands, the right sometimes supporting, and the left
afflicting; fashion us to that frame of piety thou likest best.

Forgive the pride that attends our prosperous, and the repinings which follow
our disasterous events; when going forth in our own strength, tho^ withdrawest
thine, and go not forth with our Armies.

Be thou all, when we are something, and when we are nothing; that thou may
have the glory, when we are in a victorious, or inglorious condition.

Thou O Lord know, how hard it is for me (...) suffer so much evil from my
Subjects, to whom I intend nothing but good; and I cannot but suffer in those
evils which they compel me to inflict upon them; punishing my self in their
punishments.

Since therefore both in conquering, and being conquered, I am still a
Sufferer: I beseech thee to give me a double portion of thy Spirit, and that
measure of grace, which only can be sufficient for me.

As I am most afflicted, so make me most reformed, that I may be not only
happy to see an end of these civil distractions, but a chief Instrument to
restore and establish a firm and blessed Peace to my Kingdoms.

Stir up in all Parties pious ambitions to overcome each other with reason,
moderation, and such self*deniall, as becomes those, who consider, that our
mutual divisions are our common distractions, and the union of all is every
good man's chiefest interest.

If O Lord, as for the sins of our peace, thou have brought upon us the
miseries of war; so for the sins of war thou should see fit still to deny
us the blessing of peace, and so to keep us in a circulation of miseries; yet
give me thy Servant, and all loyal, though afflicted Subjects, to enjoy that
peace, which the world can neither give to us, nor take from us.

Impute not to me the blood of my Subjects, which, with infinite unwillingnesse
and grief, has been shed by me, in my just* and necessary defense, but wash me
with that precious blood, which has been shed for me, by my great Peacemaker,
Jesus Christ who will, I trust, redeem me shortly out of all my troubles: For,
I know the triumphing of the Wicked is but short, and the joy of Hypocrites is
but for ^ moment.

20. Upon the Reformations of the Times.
NO Glory is more to be envied than that, of due Reforming either Church or
State, when deformities are such, that the perturbation and novelty are not
like to exceed the benefit of Reforming.

Although God should not honor me so far, as to make me an Instrument of so
good a work, yet I should be glad to see it done.

As I was well pleased with this Parliaments first intentions to reform what
the iudulgence of Times, and corruption of manners might have depraved; so I am
sorry to see, after the freedom of Parliament was by factious Tumults
oppressed, how little regard was had to the good Laws established, and the
Religion settled* which ought to be the first rule and standard of reforming;
with how much partiality, and popular compliance the passions, and opinions of
men have been gratified, to the detriment of the public, and the infinite
scandal of the Reformed Religion.

What dissolutions of all Order, and Government, in the Church: what novelties
o^ Schisms, and corrupt opinions; what undecencies and confusions in sacred
administrations; what sacrilegious invasions upon the Rights and Revenues of
the Church; what contempt and oppressions of the Clergy; what injurious
diminutions and persecutings of me, have followed (as showers do warm gleames)
the talk of Reformation, all sober men are Witnesses, and, with my self, sad
Spectators hitherto.

The great miscarriage I think is, that popular clamours and fury, have been
allowed the reputation of Zeal, and the public sense; so that the study to
please some Parties has indeed injured all.

Freedom, moderation, and impartiality are sure the best tempers of reforming
Counsels, and endeavors: what is acted by Factions, cannot but offend more,
than it pleases.

I have offered to put all differences in Church affairs and Religion to the
free consultation of a Synod or Convocation rightly chosen; the results of
whose Counsels as they would have included the Votes of all, so it is like they
would have given most satisfaction to all.

The Assembly of Divines, whom the two Houses have applied (in an unwonted way)
to advise of Church Affairs, I dislike not further, then that they are not
legally convened and chosen; nor Act in the name of all the Clergy of England;
nor with freedom and impartiality can do any thing, being limited and
confined, if not over-^wed, to do and declare what they do.

For I cannot think so many men cried up for learning and piety, who formerly
allowed the Liturgy and Government of the Church of England, as to the maine,
would have so suddenly agreed quite to abolish both of them, (the last of
which, they knew to be of Apostolical institution, at least, as of Primitive
and Universal practice) if they had been left to the liberty of their own
suffrages, and if the influence of contrary Factions had not, by secret
encroachments of hopes, and fears, prevailed upon them, to comply with so
great and dangerous Innovations in the Church; without any regard to their own
former judgment and practice, or to the common interest and honor of all the
Clergy, and in them of Order, Learning, and Religion against examples of all
Ancient Churches; the Laws in force, and my consent; which is never to be
gained against so pregnant light, as in that point shines on my understanding.

For I conceive, that, where the Scripture is not so clear and punctual in
precepts, there the constant and Universal practice of the Church, in things
not contrary to Reason, Faith, good Manners, or any positive Command, is the
best Rule that Christians can follow.

I was willing to grant, or restore to Presbytery, what with reason or
discretion it can pretend to, in a conjuncture with Episcopacy; but for that
wholly to invade the Power, and by the Sword to arrogate, and quite abrogate
the Authority of that Ancient Order, I think neither just, as to Episcopacy,
nor safe for Presbytery; nor yet any way convenient for this Church or State.

A due reformation had easily followed moderate Counsels; and (such I believe)
as would have given more content, even to the most of those Divines, who have
been led on with much Gravity and Formality, to carry on other men's designs:
which, no doubt, many of them by this time discover, though they dare not but
smother their frustrations, and discontents.

The specious and popular titles, of Christ's Government; Throne, Scepter, and
Kingdom (which certainly is not divided, nor has two faces, as their Parties
now have, at least) also the noise of a through Reformation, these may as
easily be fixed on new modells, as fair colors may be put to ill-favored
figures.

The breaking of Church-windowes, which Time had sufficiently defaced; pulling
down of Crosses, which were but civil, not Religious marks; defacing of the
Monuments, and Inscriptions of the Dead, which served but to put Posterity in
mind, to thank God, for that clearer light, wherein they live; The leaving of
all Ministers to their liberties, and private abilities, in the Public service
of God, where no Christian can tell to what he may say Amen; nor what adventure
he may make, of seeming, at least, to consent to the Errors, Blasphemies, and
ridiculous Undecencies, which bold and ignorant men list to vent in their
Prayers, Preaching, and other offices; The setting forth also of old
Catechismes, and Confessions of Faith new dressed, importing as much, as if there
had been no sound or clear Doctrine of Faith in this Church, before some four
or five years consultation had matured their thoughts, touching their first
Principles of Religion.

All these, and the like are the effects of popular, specious, and deceitful
Reformations, (that they might not seem to have nothing to do) and may give
some short flashes of content to the Vulgar, (who are taken with novelties, as
Children with Babies, very much, but not very long) But all this amounts not
to, nor can in Justice merit the glory of the Churches through Reformation;
since they leave all things more deformed, disorderly, and discontented, then
when they began in point of Piety, Morality, Charity, and good Order.

Nor can they easil^ recompense or remedy the inconveniences and mischiefs,
which they have purchased so dearly, and which have, and ever will necessarily
ensue, till due remedies be applied.

I wish they would, at last, make it their Unanimous work, to do Gods work,
and not their own: Had Religion been first considered (as it merited) much
trouble might have been prevented.

But some men thought, that the Government of this Church and State, fixed by
so many Laws, and long Customs, would not run into their new moulds, till
they had first melted it in the fire of a Civil War; by the advantages of
which they resolved, if they prevailed, to make my self and all my Subjects
fall down, and worship the Images they should form and set up: If there had
been as much of Christ's Spirit, for meekness, wisdom, and charity, in men's
hearts, as there was of his Name used in the pretensions, to reform all to
Christ's Rule, it would certainly have obtained more of Gods blessing, and
produced more of Christ's Glory, the Churches good, the Honor of Religion, and
the Unity of Christians.

Public Reformers had need first Act in private, and practice that on their
own hearts, which they purpose to try on others; for Deformities within, will
soon betray the pretenders of public Reformations, to such private designs as
must needs hinder the public good.

I am sure the right Methods of Reforming the Church cannot consist with that
of perturbing the Civil State; nor can Religion be justly advanced by
depressing Loyalty, which is one of the chiefest Ingredients, and Ornaments of
true Religion; for, next to fear God, is, Honor the King.

I doubt not but Christ's Kingdom may be set up without pulling down Mine; nor
will any men in impartial times appear good Christians, that approve not
themselves good Subjects.

Christ's Government will confirm Mine, not overthrow it; since as I own mine
from him, so I desire to rule for his Glory, and his Churches good.

Had some men truly intended Christ's Government, or knew what it meant in
their hearts, they could never have been so ill-governed in in their words, and
actions, both against me and one another.

As good ends cannot justify evil means, so nor will evil beginnings ever
bring forth good conclusions; unless God, by a miracle of Mercy, create Light
out of Darkness, order out of our confusions, and peace out of our passions.

Thou, O Lord, who only can give us beauty for ashes, and Truth for
Hypocrisy; suffer us not to be miserably deluded with Pharisaicall washings,
instead of Christian reformings.

Our greatest deformities are within, make us the severest Censurers, and first
Reformers of our own souls.

That we may in clearness of judgment, and uprightness of heart be means to
reform what is indeed amiss in Church and State.

Create in us clean hearts, O Lord, and renew right spirits within us; that we
may do all by thy directions, to thy glory, and with thy blessing.

Pity the deformities, which some rash and cruel Reformers have brought upon
this Church and State: Quench the fires which Factions have kindled, under the
pretense of Reforming.

As thou have showed the world by their divisions and confusions what is the
pravity of some men's intentions, and weakness of their judgments, so bring ^s
at last more refined out of these fires by the methods of Christian and
charitable Reformations, wherein nothing of ambition, revenge, covetousness,
or srcriledge, may have any influence upon their co^nsells, whom thy providence
in just and lawful ways shall entrust with so great, good, and now most
necessary work: that I and my People may be so blessed with inward piety, as may
best teach us how to use the blessing of outward peace.

21. Upon his Majesty's Letters taken and divulged.
THe taking of my Letters was an opportunity, which as the malice of mine
enemies could hardly have expected; so they knew not how with honor and
civility to use it; Nor do I think, with sober and worthy minds, any thing in
them could tend so much to my reproach, as the odious divulging of them did to
the infamy of the Divulgers: the greatest experiments of virtue and nobleness
being discovered in the greatest advantages against an enemy, and the greatest
obligations being those, which are put upon us by them, from whom we could
least have expected them.

And such I should have esteemed the concealing of My Papers; The freedom and
secrecy of which, commands a civility from all men, not wholly barbarous; nor
is there any thing more inhumane than to expose them to public view.

Yet since providence will have it so, I am content so much of My heart (which
I study to approve to Gods omniscience) should be discovered to the world,
without any of those dresses, or popular captations, which some men use in
their Speeches, and Expresses; I wish my Subjects had yet a clearer sight into
my most retired thoughts.

Where they might discover, how they are divided between the love and care I
have, not more to preserve my own Rights, than to procure their peace and
happiness, and that extreme grief to see them both deceived and destroyed.

Nor can any men's malice be gratified further by my Letters, than to see my
constancy to my Wife, the Laws, and Religion. Bees will gather Honey where
the Spider sucks Poison.

That I endeavor to avoid the pressures of my Enemies, by all fair and just
correspondencies, no man can blame, who loves me, or the Commonwealth; since
my Subjects can hardly be happy if I be miserable, or enjoy their peace and
liberties while I am oppressed.

The world may see how soon men's design, like Absoloms, is by enormous actions
to widen differences, and exasperate all sides to such distances, as may make
all reconciliation desperate.

Yet I thank God I can not only with patience bear this, as other indignities:
but with Charity forgive them.

The integrity of my intentions is not jealous of any injury, My expressions
can do them; for although the confidence of privacy may admit greater freedom
in writing such Letters, which may be liable to envious exceptions; yet the
Innocence of my chief purposes cannot be so obtained, or mis-interpreted by
them, as not to let all men see, that I wish nothing more than an happy
composure of differences with Justice and Honor, not more to my own, then my
Peoples content, who have any sparks of Love or Loyalty left in them: who, by
those my Letters may be convinced, that I can both mind and act my own, and My
Kingdoms Affairs, so as becomes a Prince; which mine enemies have always
been very loath should be believed of me, as if I were wholly confined to the
Dictates and Directions of others; whom they please to brand with the names of
Evil Counselors.

It Is probable some men will now look upon me as my own Counselor, and
having none else to quarrel with under that notion, they will hereafter
confine their anger to my self: Although I know they are very unwilling I
should enjoy the liberty of my own Thoughts, or follow the light of my own
Conscience, which they labor to bring into an absolute captivity to
themselves; not allowing me to think their Counsels to be other then good for
me, which have so long maintained a War against me.

The Victory they obtained that day, when my Letters became their prize, had
been enough to have satiated the most ambitious thirst of popular glory among
the Vulgar; with whom prosperity gains the greatest esteem and applause, as
adversity exposes to their greatest slighting and dis-respect: As if good
fortu^e were always the shadow of Virtue and Justice, and did not oftener
attend vicious and injurious actions, as to this world.

But I see no secular advantages seem sufficient to that cause, which began
with Tumults, and depends chiefly upon the reputation with the Vulgar.

They think no Victories so effectual to their designs as those: that most
rout and waste my Credit with my People; in whose hearts they seek by all
means to smother and extinguish all sparks of Love, Respect and Loyalty to me,
that they may never kindle again, so as to recover mine, the Laws, and the
Kingdoms Liberties, which some men seek to overthrow: The taking away of my
Credit is but a necessary preparation to the taking away of my life, and my
Kingdoms; First I must seem neither fit to live, nor worthy to Reign; By
exquisite methods of cunning and cruelty, I must be compelled, first to follow
the Funerals of my Honor, and then be destroyed: But I know Gods un-erring
and impartial justice can, and will overrule the most perverse wills and
designs of men; He is able, and (I hope) will turn even the worst of mine
enemies thoughts and actions to my good.

Nor do I think, that by the surprise of my Letters, I have lost any more than
so many Papers: How much they have lost of that reputation, for Civility and
Humanity which ought to be paid to all men, and most becomes such as pretend
to Religion) besides that of respect and Honor, which they owe to their KING,
present, and aftertimes will judge. And I cannot think that their own
consciences are so stupid, as not to inflict upon them some secret impressions
of that shame and dishonor, which attends all unworthy actions, have they
never so much of public flattery, and popular countenance.

I am sure they can never expect the divine approbation of such indecent
actions, if they do but remember how God blessed the modest respect and fil^all
tenderness, which Noah's Sons bare to their Father; nor did his open infirmity
justify Chams impudency, or exempt him from that curse of being Servant of
Servants; which curse must needs be on them who seek by dishonorable actions
to please the Vulgar; and confirm, by ignoble acts, their dependence upon the
People.

Nor can their malicious intentions be ever either excusable, or prosperous,
who thought by this means to expose me to the highest reproach and contempt of
My People; forgetting that duty of modest concealment, which they owed to the
Father of their Country, in case they had disovered any real uncomelinesse;
which, I thank God, they did not; who can, and, I believe, has made me more
respected in the hearts of many (as he did David) to whom they thought, by
publishing my private Letters, to have rendered me as a vile Person, not fit to
be trusted or considered, under any notion of Majesty.

But thou, o Lord, whose wise and all-disposing providence, orders the
greatest contingences of humane affairs; make me to see the constancy of thy
mercies to me, in the greatest advantages thou seem to give the malice of my
Enemies against me.

As thou did blast the counsel of Achitophel, ^urning it to David's good, and
his own ruin; so so can thou defeat their design, who intended, by
publishing my private Letters, nothing else, but to under me more odious and
contemptible to my People.

I must first appeal to thy Omniscience, who can witness with my integrity,
how unjust and ^alse those scandalous misconstructions are, which ^y Enemies
endeavor by those Papers of mine to ^epresent to the world.

Make the evil they imagined, and displea^^r^ they intended thereby against
me, so to (...) on their own heads, that they may be ashamed, and covered with
their own confusion, as with a cloak.

Thou see how mine Enemies use all means to cloud mine Honor, to pervert my
purposes, and to slander the footsteps of thine Anointed.

But give me an heart content to be dishonored for thy sake, and thy Churches
good.

Fix in me a purpose to honor thee, and then I know thou will honor me,
either by restoring to me the enjoyment of that Power and Majesty, which thou
have suffered some men to seek to deprive me of, or by bestowing on me that
crown of Christian patience, which knows how to serve thee in honor, or
dishonor, in good report or evil.

Thou, O Lord, art the fountain of goodness, and honor; thou art colathed
with excellent Majesty; make me to partake of thy excellency for wisdom,
justice, and mercy, and I shall not want that degree of Honor and Majesty,
which becomes the Place in which thou have set me; who art the lifter up of my
head and my salvation.

Lord, by thy grace, lead me to thy Glory, which is both true and eternal.

22. Upon His Majesty's leaving Oxford, and going to the Scots.
ALthough God has given Me three Kingdoms, yet in these he has no^ now left
me any place, where I may wit^ Safety and Honor rest my Head: Showing me that
himself is the fafest Refuge, and the strongest Tower of defense, in which I
may put my Trust.

In these extremities, I look not to man so much as to God; He will have it
thus; that I may wholly cast my self, and my now distressed affairs upon his
mercy, who has both hearts and hands of all men in his dispose.

What providence denies to Force, it may grant to Prudence: Necessity is now my
Counselor, and commands me to study my safety by a disguised withdrawing from
my chiefest strength, and adventuring upon their Loyalty, who first began my
Troubles. Happily God may make them a means honorably to compose them.

This my confidence of Them, may dis-arme and overcome them; my rendering my
Person to them, may engage their affections to me, who have often professed, They
^ought not against me, but for me.

I must now resolve the riddle of their Loyalty; and give them opportunity to
let the world see, they mean not what they do, but what they say.

Yet must God be my chiefest Guard; and My Conscience both My Counselor and
My Comforter: Though I put my Body into their hands, yet I shall reserve my
Soul to God, and my self; nor shall any necessity compel me, to desert mine
Honor, or swerve from my Judgment.

What they sought to take by force, shall now be given them in such a way of
unusual confidence of them, as may make them ashamed not to be really such, as
they ought, and professed to be.

God sees it not enough to deprive me of all Military power to defend my self;
but to put me upon using their power, who seem to fight against me, yet ought
in duty to defend me.

So various are all humane affairs, and so necessitous may the state of
Princes be, that their greatest danger may be in their supposed safety, and
their safety in their supposed danger.

I must now leave those, that have adhered to me, and apply to those that have
opposed me; this method of Peace may be more prosperous, than that of War,
both to stop the effusion of blood, and to close those wounds already made: and
in it I am no less solicitous for My Friends safety, than mine own; choosing
to venture my self upon further hazards, rather then expose their resolute
Loyalty to all extremities.

It is some skill in play to know when a game is lost; better fairly to give
over, than to contest in vain.

I must now study to reinforce my judgment, and fortify my mind with Reason
and Religion; that I may not seem to offer up my Souls liberty, or make my
Conscience their Captive; who ought at first to have used arguments, not Arms,
to have persuaded my consent to their new demands.

I thank God, no success darkens or disguises Truth to me; and I shall no
less conform my words to my inward dictates now, than if they had been as the
words of a KING ought to be among loyal Subjects, full of power.

Reason is the divinest power. I shall never think my self weakened while I may
make full and free use of that. No eclipse of outward fortune shall rob me of
that light; what God has denied of outward strength, his grace, I hope, will
supply with inward resolutions; not morosely to deny, what is fit to be
granted; but not to grant any thing, which Reason and Religion bids me deny.

I shall never think my self, less than my self, while I am able thus to
preserve the Integrity of my Conscience, the only Jewel now left me, which is
worth keeping.

O thou Sovereign of our Souls, the only Commander of our Consciences;
though I know not what to do, yet mine eyes are toward thee: To the protection
of thy mercy I still commend my self.

As thou have preserved me in the day of Battle, so thou can still show me
thy strength in my weakness.

Be thou unto me in my d^rkest night, a pillar of fire, to enlighten and direct
me; in the day of my hottest affliction, be also a pillar of cloud to
overshadow and protect me; be to me, both a Sun and a Shield.

Thou know, that it is not any perverseness of will, but just persuasions
of Honor, Reason, and Religion, which have made me thus far to hazard my
Person, Peace, and Safety, against those, that by force have sought to wrest
them from Me.

Suffer not my just resolutions to abate with my outward Forces; let a good
conscience always accompany me, in my solitude and desertions.

Suffer me not to betray the powers of Reason, and that fortress of my soul,
which I am entrusted to keep for thee.

Lead me in the paths of thy righteousness, and show me thy salvation.

Make my ways to please thee, and then thou will make mine Enemies to be at
peace with me.

23. Upon the Scots delivering the KING to the English; and his Captivity at
Holmeby.
YEt may I justify those Scots to all the world in this, that they have not
deceived me; for I never trusted to them further, than to men: If I am sold by
them, I am only sorry they should do it; and that my price should be so much
above my Saviors.

These are but further Essaies, which God will have me make of man's
uncertainty, the more to fix me on himself; who never fails them that trust
in him; Though the Reeds of Egypt break under the hand of him that leanes on
them, yet the Rock of Israel will be an everlasting stay and defense.

Gods providence commands me to rerire from all to himself, that in him I may
enjoy my self, which I lose, while I let out my hopes to others.

The solitude and captivity, to which I am now reduced, gives me leisure enough
to study the worlds vanity, and inconstancy

God sees it is fit to deprive me of Wife, Children, Army, Friends, and Freedom,
that I may be wholly his, who alone is all.

I care not much to be reckoned among the Unfortunate, if I be not in the black
List of irreligious, and sacrilegious Princes.

No Restraint shall ensnare my soul in sin, nor gain that of me, which may
make my Enemies more insolent, my Friends ashamed, or my Name accursed.

They have no great cause to triumph, that they have got my Person into their
power; since my Soul is still my own: nor shall they ever gain my Consent
against my Conscience.

What they call obstinacy, I know God accounts honest constancy; from which
Reason and Religion, as well as Honor, forbid me to recede.

It Is evident now, that it was not evil Counselors with me, but a good
Conscience in me, which has been fought against; nor did they ever intend to
bring me to my Parliament, till they had brought my mind to their obedience.

Should I grant what some men desire, I should be such as they wish me, not
more a King, and far less both Man and Christian.

What Tumults and Armies could not obtain, neither shall Restraint; which
though it have as little of safety to a Prince, yet it has not more of danger.

The fear of men shall never be my snare; nor shall the love of any liberty
entangle my soul: Better others betray me than my self; and that the price of
my liberty should be my Conscience: the greatest injuries my Enemies seek to
inflict upon me, cannot be without my own consent.

While I can deny with Reason, I shall defeat the greatest impressions of their
malice, who neither know how to use worthily, what I have already granted; nor
what to require more of me but this, That I would seem willing to help them to
destroy my self and mine.

Although they should destroy me, yet they shall have no cause to despise me.

Neither liberty nor life are so dear to me, as the peace of my Conscience, the
Honor of my Crowns; and the welfare of my People; which my word may injure
more than any War can do; while I gratify a few to oppress all.

The Laws will, by Gods blessing, revive, with the love and Loyalty of my
Subjects; if I bury them not by my Consent, and cover them in that grave of
dishonor and injustice, which some men's violence has dug for them.

If my Captivity or Death must be the price of their redemption, I grudge not
to pay it.

No condition can make a King miserable, which carries not with it, his Souls,
his Peoples and Posterities thraldom.

Aftertimes may see, what the blindness of this Age will not; and God may at
length show my Subjects, that I choose rather to suffer for them, than with
them; happily, I might redeem my self to some show of liberty, if I would
consent to enslave them: I had rather hazard the ruin of one King, than to
confirm many Tyrants over them; from whom I pray God deliver them, what ever
becomes of me, whose solitude has not left me alone.

For thou O God, infinitely good, and great, art with me, whose presence is
better than life; and whose service is perfect freedom.

Own me for thy servant, and I shall never have cause to complain for want of
that liberty, which becomes a Man, a Christian, and a King.

Bless me still with Reason as a Man; with Religion, as a Christian; and with
constancy in justice, as a King.

Though thou suffer me to be stripped of all outward ornaments, yet preserve
me ever in those enjoyments, wherein I may enjoy thy self; and which cannot be
taken from me against my will.

Let no fire of affliction boil over my passion to any impatience, or sordid
fears.

There be many say of me, There is no help for me: do thou lift up the light
of thy countenance upon me, and I shall neither want safety, liberty, nor
majesty.

Give me that measure of patience and constancy, which my condition now
requires.

My strength is scattered, my expectation from men defeated, my Person
restrained; o be not thou far from me, lest my Enemies prevail too much
against me.

I am become a wonder and a scorn to many: o ^e thou my Helper and Defender.

Show some token upon me for good, that they that hate me may be ashamed,
because thou Lord have ^olpen and comforted me: establish me with thy free
Spirit, that I may do, and suffer thy will, as thou ^ouldst have me.

Be merciful to me, o Lord, for my soul trusts in thee: yea and in the
shadow of thy wings will ^ make my refuge until these calamities be over^^st.

Arise to deliver me, make no long tarrying, o ^y God. Though thou killest me,
yet will I trust in thy mercy, and my Saviors merit.

I know that my Redeemer lives; though thou leadest me through the vale and
shadow of death, yet shall I fear none ill.

24. Upon their denying His Majesty the Attendance of His Chaplains.
When Providence was pleased to deprive Me of all other Civil comforts and
secular Attendants, I thought the abscence of them all might best be supplied
by the attendance of some of my Chaplains; whom for their Function I reverence,
and for their Fidelity I have cause to love. By their learning, piety, and
prayers, I hoped to be either better enabled to sustain the want of all other
enjoyments, or better fitted for the recovery and use of them in Gods good
time: so reaping by their pious help a spiritual harvest of grace amidst the
thorns, and after the plowings of temporal crosses.

The truth is, I never needed or desired more the service and assistance of men
judiciously pious, and soberly devout.

The solitude they have confined me unto, adds the Wilderness to my
temptations; for, the company they obtrude upon me, is more sad than any
solitude can be.

If I had asked my Revenues, my Power of the Militia, or any one of my
Kingdoms, it had been no wonder to have been denied in those things, where the
evil policy of men forbids all just restitution, lest they should confess an
injurious usurpation: But to deny me the Ghostly comfort of my Chaplains,
seems a greater rigor and barbarity, then is ever used by Christians to the
meanest Prisoners, and greatest Malefactors; whom though the justice of the Law
deprive of worldly comforts, yet the mercy of Religion allows them the benefit
of their Clergy; as not aiming at once to destroy their Bodies, and to damn
their Souls.

But my Agony must not be relieved with the presence of any one good Angel;
for ^wich I account a Learned, Godly, and discreet Divine: and such I would
have all Mine to be.

They that envy my being a King, are loath I should be a Christian; while they
seek to de^rive me of all things else, They are afraid I should save my soul.

Other sense Charity it self can hardly pick out of those many harsh Repulses
I received, as to that request so often made for the attendance of some of my
Chaplains.

I have sometime thought the Unchristian^esse of those denialls might arise
from a displeasure some men had to see me prefer my own Divines before their
Ministers: whom though I ^uspect for that worth and piety which may be in them;
yet I cannot think them so proper for any present Comforters or Physicians; who
have (some of them at least) had so great an influence ^n occasioning these
calamities, and inflicting these wounds upon me.

Nor are the soberest of them so apt for that devotionall compliance, and
juncture of hearts, which I desire to bear in those holy Offices, to be
performed with me, and for me; since their judgments standing at a distance
from me, or in jealousy of me, or in opposition against me, their Spirits
cannot so harmoniously accord with mine, or mine with theirs, either in Prayer,
or other holy duties, as is meet, and most comfortable, whose golden Rule, and
bond of Perfection consists in that of mutual Love and Charity.

Some remedies are worse then the disease, and some Comforters more miserable
then misery it self; when, like Jobs friends, they seek not to fortify ones
mind with patience; but persuade a man, by betraying his own Innocence, to
despair of Gods mercy; and, by justifying their injuries, to strengthen the
hands, and harden the hearts of insolent Enemies.

I am so much a friend to all Churchmen, that have any thing in them beseeming
that sacred Function, that I have hazarded My own Interests, chiefly upon
Conscience and Constancy to maintain their Rights; whom the more I looked upon
as Orphans, and under the sacrilegious eyes of many cruel and rapacious
Reformers; so I thought it my duty the more to appear as a Father, and a
Patron for them and the Church. Although I am very unhandsomly requited by some
of them; who may live to repent no less for my sufferings, than their own
ungrateful errors, and that injurious contempt and meannesse, which they have
brought upon their Calling and Persons.

I pity all of them, I despise none: only I thought I might have leave to make
choice of some for my special Attendants, who were best approved in my
judgment, and most suitable to my affection. For, I held it better to seem
undevout, and to hear no men's prayers, than to be forced, or seem to comply
with those Petitions, to which the heart cannot consent, nor the tongue say
Amen, without contradicting a man's own understanding, or belying his own soul.

In Devotions, I love neither profane boldness, nor pious nonsense; but such
an humble and judicious gravity, as shows the Speaker to be at once
considerate of Gods Majesty, the Churches honor, and his own Vileness; both
knowing what things God allows him to ask, and in what manner it becomes a
Sinner to supplicate the divine Mercy for himself, and others.

I am equally scandalized with all prayers, that sound either imperiously, or
rudely, and passionately; as either wanting humility to God, or charity to men,
or respect to the duty.

I confess I am better pleased, as with studied and premeditated Sermons, so
with such public Forms of Prayers, as are fitted to the Churches and every
Christians daily and common necessities; because I am by them better assured,
what I may join my heart unto, than I can be of any man's extemporary
sufficiency; which as I do not wholly exclude from public occasions, so I
allow its just liberty and use in private and devout retirements; where neither
the solemnity of the duty, nor the modest regard to others, do require so
great exactness as to the outward manner of performance. Though the light of
understanding, and the fervency of affection, I hold the maine and most
necessary requisites both in constant, and occasional, solitary, and sociall
Devotions.

So that I must needs seem to all equal minds with as much Reason to prefer
the service of my own Chaplains before that of their Ministers, as I do the
Liturgy before their Directory.

In the one, I have been always educated and exercised; In the other, I am not
yet Catechized, nor acquainted; And if I were, yet should I not by that, as by
any certain rule and Canon of devotion be able to follow or find out the
indirect extravagances of most of those men, who highly cry up that as a piece
of rare composure and use; which is already as much despised and disused by
many of them, as the Common Prayer sometimes was by those men; a great part of
whose piety hung upon that popular pin of railing against, and contemning the
Government, and Liturgy of this Church. But, I had rather be condemned to the
woe of Vae soli, than to that of Vae vobis Hypocritis, by seeming to pray what
I do not approve.

It may be, I am esteemed by my Denyers sufficient of My self to discharge My
duty to God as a Priest, though not to Men as a Prince.

Indeed, I think both Offices, Regal and Sacerdotall, might will become the
same Person; as anciently they were under one name, and the united rights of
primogeniture: Nor could I follow better presidents, if I were able* than those
^wo eminent Kings, David, and Solomon; not more famous for their Scepters and
Crowns, than one was for devout Psalms and Prayers; the other for his divine
Parables and Preaching: whence one merited and assumed the name of a Prophet,
the other of a Preacher. Titles indeed of greater Honor, where rightly placed,
than any of those the Roman Emperors affected from the Nations they subdued:
it being infinitely more glorious to convert Souls to Gods Church by the Word,
than to conquer men to a subjection by the Sword.

Yet since the order of Gods wisdom and providence has, for the most part,
always distinguished the gifts and offices of Kings, of Priests, of Princes
and Preachers; both in the Jewish and Christian Churches; I am sorry to find My
self reduced to the necessity of being both, or enjoying neither.

For such as seek to deprive Me of Kingly power and Sovereignty, would no less
enforce Me ^o live many Months without all Prayers, Sacraments, and Sermons,
unless I become My own Chaplain.

As I owe the Clergy the protection of a Christian KING, so I desire to enjoy
from them the benefit of their gifts and prayers* which I look upon as more
prevalent than My own, or other men's, by how much they flow from minds more
enlightened, and affections less distracted, than those which are uncombred
with secular affairs, besides, I think a greater blessing and acceptablenesse
attends those duties, which are rightly performed, as proper to, and within the
limits of that calling to which God and the Church have specially designed and
consecrated some men: and however, as to that Spiritual Government, by which
the devout Sonl is ^ubject to Christ, and through his merits daily offers it
self and its services to God, every private believer is a King and Priest,
invested with tbe honor of a Royal Priesthood; yet, as to Ecclesiastical
order, and the outward polity of the Church, I think confusion in Religion will
as certainly follow every man's turning Priest or Preacher, as it will in the
State, where every one affects to rule as King.

I was always bred to more modest, and I think, more pious principles: the
consciousnesse to My Spiritual defects makes me more prize and desire those
pious assistances, which holy and good Ministers, either Bishops or Presbyters,
may afford Me; especially in these extremities, to which God has bin pleased to
suffer some of my Subjects to reduce me; so as to leave them nothing more, but
My life to take from me, and to leave me nothing to desire, which I thought
might less provoke their jealousy and offense to deny Me, than this of having
some means afforded Me for My Souls comfort and support.

To which end I made choice of men, as no way (that I know) scandalous, so
every way eminent for their learning and piety, no less than for their
Loyalty: nor can I imagine any exceptions to be made against them, but only
this, that they may seem too able and too well affected toward me and My service.

But this is not the first service (as I count it the best) in which they have
forced Me to serve My self, though I must confess I bear with more grief and
impatience the want of My Chaplains, than of any other My Servants* and next
(if not beyond in some things) to the being sequestered from my Wife and
Children; since from these indeed more of humane and temporary affections, but
from those more of heavenly and eternal improvements may be expected.

My comfort is, that, in the enforced (not neglected) want of ordinary means,
God is wont to afford extraordinary supplies of his gifts and graces.

If his Spirit will teach me and help My infirmities in prayer, reading and
meditation (as I hope he will) I shall need no other, either Orator or
Instructor.

To Thee therefore, O my God, do I direct my now solitary prayers; what I want
of others help, supply with the more immediate assistances of thy Spirit, which
alone can both enlighten My darkness, and quicken My dullness.

O thou Sun of righteousness, thou sacred Fountain of heavenly light and
heat, at once clear and warm my heart, both by instructing of me, and
interceding for me: In thee is all fullness: from thee all sufficiency: By thee
is all acceptance. Thou art company enough, and comfort enough: Thou art my
King, be also my Prophet and my Priest. Rule me, teach me, pray in me, for me;
and be thou ever with me.

The single wrestlings of Jacob prevailed with thee, in that sacred Duel, when
he had none to second him but thy self; who did assist him with power to
overcome thee, and by a welcome violence to wrest a blessing from thee.

O look on me thy Servant, in infinite mercy, whom thou did once bless with
the joint and sociated Devotions of others, whose fervencie might inflame the
coldness of my affections toward thee; when we went to, or met in thy House
with the voice of I^y and gladness, worshipping thee in the unity of spirits,
and with bond of Peace.

O forgive the neglect, and not improving of those happy opportunities.

It is now thy pleasure that I should be as a Pelican in the wilderness, as a
Sparrow on the House top, and as a coal scattered from all those pious
glowings, and devout reflections, which might best ^indle, preserve, and
increase the holy fire of thy graces on the Altar of my heart, whence the
sacrifice of prayers, and incense of praises, might be duly offered up to thee.

Yet O thou that breakest not the bruized Reed, nor quenchest the smoking
Flax, do not despise the weakness of my prayers, nor the smotherings ^f my
soul in this uncomfortable loneness; to which I am constrained by some men's
uncharitable deni^lls of those helps, which I much want, and no less desire. O
let the hardness of their hearts occasion the softnings of mine to thee, and for
Them. Let their hatred kindle my love, let their unreasonable de^^alls of my
Religious desires the more excite my prayers to thee. Let their inexorahle
deafness incline thine ear to me; who art a God easy to be ^ntreated; thine
ear is not heavy, that it cannot, nor thy heart hard, that it will not hear;
nor thy ^and shortened, that it cannot help M^ thy desolate Suppliant.

Thou permittest men to deprive me of those out^ard means, which thou have
appointed in thy Church, but they cannot debar me from the com^union of that
inward grace, which thou alone ^reathest into humble hearts.

O make m^ such, and thou will teach me; thou ^ilt hear me, thou will help me:
The broken and ^^ntrite heart I know thou will not despise.

Thou, O Lord can a^ once make me thy Temple, ^hy Priest, thy sacrifice, and
thine Altar; while from an humble heart I (alone) daily offer up in holy
meditations, fervent prayers, and unfeigned tears my self to thee: who
preparest me for thee, dwell s^ in me, ^ad acceptest of me.

Thou, O Lord, did cause by secret supplies and miraculous infusions, that
the handful of meal in the vessel should not spend, nor the little oil in the
cruise fail the Widow during the time of drought and dearth.

O look on my soul, which as a Widow is now desolate and forsaken: let not
those saving truths I have formerly learned now fail my memory; nor the sweet
effusions of thy Spirit, which I have sometime felt, now be wanting to wy heart
in this famine of ordinary and wholesome food for the refreshing of My Soul.

Which yet I had rather choose than to feed fom those hands who mingle my bread
with ashes, and my wine with gall; rather torme nting than teaching me; whose
mou^hs are proner to bitter reproaches of me, ^hen to hearty prayers for me.

Thou know, O Lord of truth, how often they wrest thy holy Scriptures to my
destruction, (which* are clear for their subjection, and my preservation) O let
it not be to their damnation.

Thou know how some men (under color of long prayrs) have sought to devour
the houses of their Brethren, their King, and their God. O Let not those men's
balms break my head, nor their Cordialls oppress my heart, I will evermore
pray against their wickedness.

From the poison under their tongues, from the snares of their lips, from the
fire, and the swords of their words ever deliver Me, O Lord and all those
Loyal and Religious hearts, who desire and delight in the prosperity of my
soul, and who seek by their prayers to relieve this sadness and solitude of
thy servant, O my King and my God.

25. Penitential Meditations and Vows in the Kings solitude at Holmeby.
GIve ear to my words O Lord, consider my Meditations, and hearken to the
voice of my cry, my King and my God, for unto thee will I pray.

I said in my have I am cast out of the sight of thine eyes; nevertheless thou
hear the voice of my supplication, when I cry unto thee.

If thou Lord should be extreme to mark what is don amiss, who can abide it?
But there is mercy with thee, that thou may be feared; therefore shall
sinners fly unto thee.

I acknowledge my sius before thee which have the aggravation of my condition;
the eminency of my place adding weight to my offense.

Forgive, I beseech thee, my Personal, and my Peoples sins; which are so far
mine, as I have not improved the power thou gave me, to thy glory, and my
Subjects good: Thou have now brought Me from the glory and freedom of a King,
to be a Prisoner to my oun Subjects: Justly, O Lord, as to thy overruling
hand, because in many things I have rebelled against thee.

Though Thou have restrained my Person, yet enlarge my heart to Thee, and thy
grace toward Me.

I come far short of David's piety; yet since I may equal David's afflictions,
give Me also the comforts and the sure mercies of David.

Let the penitent sense I have of my sins, be an evidence to me, that thou have
pardoned them.

Let not the Evils, which I and my Kingdoms have suffered, seem little unto
thee; though thou have no^ punished us according to our sins.

Turn thee [O Lord] unto Me; have mercy upon Me, for I am desolate and
afflicted.

The sorrows of my heart are enlarged; O bring thou me out of my troubles.

Have thou forgotten to be gracious, and shut up thy loving kindness in
displeasure?

O Remember thy compassions of old, and thy lovi^g kindness, which have been
for many Generations.

I had utterly fainted, if I had not believed to see thy goodness in the land of
the living.

Let not the sins of our prosperity deprive us of the benefit of thy
afflictions.

Let this fiery trial consume the dross, which in long peace and plenty we had
contracted.

Though thou continuest miseryes, yet withdraw not thy grace; what is wanting
of prosperity make up ^n patience and repentance.

And if thy anger be not to be yet turned away, but thy ^and of justice most be
stretched out still; Let it, I beseech thee, be against me, and my Fathers
house; as for these sheep, what have they done?

Let my sufferings satiate the malice of Mine, and thy Churches Enemies.

But let their cruelty never exceed the measure of my charity.

Banish from me all thoughts of Revenge, that I may not lose the reward, nor
thou the glory of my patience.

As thou give me a heart to forgive them, so I beseech thee do thou fergive
what they have done against thee and me.

And now, O Lord, as thou have given me an heart to pray unto thee; so hear and
accept this Vow, which I make before thee.

If thou will in mercy remember me, and My Kingdoms; In continuing the light of
thy Gospel, and settling thy true Religion among us.

In restoring to us the benefit of the Laws and the due execution of ^^^tice.

In suppressing the many Schisms in Church, and Factions in State.

If thou will restore me and mine to the anci^nt Rights and glory of my
Predecessors.

If thou will turn the hearts of My people to thy self in Piety, to me in
Loyalty, and to one another in Charity.

If thou will quench the flames, and withdraw the fuel of these Civil Wars.

If thou will bless us with the freedom of public Counsels, and deliver the
Honor of Parliaments from the insolency of the Vulgar.

If thou will keep me from the great offense of enacting any thing against my
Conscience; and especially from consenting to sacrilegious rapines, and
spoilings of thy Church.

If Thou will restore Me to a capacity to gloref^e Thee in doing good, both to
the Church and State.

Then shall my soul praise thee, and magnify thy name before my People.

Then shall thy glory be dearer to me then my Crowns; and the advancement of
true Religion both in purity and power be My chiefest care.

Then will I rule my People with justice, and my Kingdoms with equity.

To thy more immediate hand shall I ever own as the rightful succession, so
the merciful restoration of My Kingdoms, and the glory of them.

If thou will bring Me again with peace, safety, and honor, to my chiefest
City, and my Parliament.

If thou will again put the Sword of Justice into my hands to punish and
protect.

Then will I make all the world to see, and my very Enemics to enjoy the
benefit of this Vow and resolution of Christian Charity, which I now make unto
thee O Lord.

As I do freely pardon for Christ's sake those that have offended me in any
kind; so my hand shall never be against any man to revenge what is past, in
regard of any particular injury done to me.*

We have been mutually pnnished in our unnatural divisions; for thy sake, O
Lord, and for the love of my Redeemer, have I purposed this in my heart That I
will use all means in tbe ways of amne^ly, and indemnity, which may most
fully remove all fears, and bury all iealousies in forgetfulness.

Let thy mercies be toward me and mine, as my resolutions of Truth and Peace
are toward my People.

Hear my prayer, O* Lord, which goes not out of feigned lips.

Blessed be God, who has not turned away my prayer; nor taken his mercy from
Me.

O my soul, commit thy way to the Lord, trust in him, and he shall bring it to
pass.

But if thou will not restore me and mine, what am I that I should charge thee
foolishly?

Thou, O Lord, have given, and thou have taken, Blessed be thy name.

May my people and thy Church be happy, if not by me, yet without me.

26* Upon the Armies Surprisall of of the King at Holmeby, and the ensuing
destractions in the two Houses, the Army, and the City.
What part God will have Me now to act or suffer in this new and strange scene
of affairs, I am not much solicitous; since little practice will serve that
man, who only seeks to represent a part of honesty and honor.

This surprise of Me tells the world, that a KING cannot be so low, but He is
considerable; adding weight to that Party where he appears.

This motion, like others of the Times, seems excentrique and irregular, yet
not well to be resisted or quieted: Better swim down such a stream, than in
vain to strive against it.

These are but the struglings of those twins, which lately one womb enclosed,
the younger striving to prevail against the elder; what the Presbyterians have
hunted after, the Independents now seek to catch for themselves.

So impossible is it for lines to be drawn from the center, and not to divide
from each other; so much the wider, by how much they go farther from the point
of union.

That the Builders of Babell should from division fall to confusion, is no
wonder; but for those that pretend to build Jerusalem, to divide their Tongues
and hands, is but an ill omen; and sounds too like the fury of those Zealots,
whose intestine bitterness and divisions were the greatest occasion of the
last fatal destruction of that City.

Well may I change my Keepers and Prison, but not my captive condition* only
with this hope of bettering, that those, who are so much professed Patrons for
the Peoples Liberties, cannot be utterly against the Liberty of their King;
what they demand for their own Consciences, they cannot in Reason deny to Mine.

In this they seem more ingenuous, than the Presbyterian rigor, who, sometimes
complaining of exacting their conformity to laws, are become the greatest
Exactors of other men's submission to their novell injunctions, before they are
stamped with the Authotity of Laws, which they cannot well have without my
consent.

It Is a great argument, that the Independents think themselves manumitted, from
their Rivals service, in that they carry on a business of such consequence, as
the assuming My Person into the Armies custody, without any Commission, but
that of their own will and power. Such, as will thus adventure on a King, must
not bethought over-modest, or timorous to carry on any design they have a mind
to.

'Their next motion menaces, and scares both the two Houses and the City:
which, soon after acting over again that former part of tumultuary motions
(never questioned, punished, or repented) must now suffer for both; and see
their former sin in the glass of the preseut terrors and distractions.

No man is so blind as not to see herein the hand of divine Justice; they, that
by Tumults first occasioned the raising of Arms, must now be chastened by their
own Army for new Tumults.

So hardly can men be content with one sin, but add sin to sin, till the
later punish the former; such as were content to see Me, and many Members of
both Houses, driven away by the first unsuppressed Tumults, are now forced to
fly to an Army, to defend themselves against them.

But who can unfold the riddle of some men's justice? the Members of both houses
who at first withdrew, (as my self was forced to do) from the rudeness of
the Tumults, were counted desertors, and outed of their Places in Parliament.

Such as stayed then, and enjoyed the benefit of the Tumults, were asserted for
the only Parliament Men: now the Flyers from, and Forsakers of their Places,
carry the Parliamentary power along with them; complain highly against the
tumults, and vindicate themselves by an Army: such as remained and kept their
stations, are looked upon as Abbettors of tumultuary insolences, and Betrayers
of the Freedom and Honor of Parliament.

Thus is Power above all Rule, Order, and Law* where men look more to present
Advantages then their consciences, and the unchangeable rules of Justice; while
they are Judges of others, they are forced to condemn themselves.

Now the plea against Tumults hold good, the Authors and Abettors of them are
guilty of prodigious insolences; when as before, they were counted as Friends
and necessary Assistants.

I see Vengeance pursues and overtakes (as the Mice and Rats are said to have
done the Bishop in Germany) them that thought to have escaped and fortified
themselves most impregnably against it, both by their multitude and compliance.

Whom the Laws cannot, God will punish, by their own crimes and hands.

I cannot but observe this divine Justice, yet with sorrow and pity; for, I
always wished so well to Parliament and City, that I was sorry to see them do,
or suffer, any thing unworthy such great and considerable bodies in this
Kingdom.

I was glad to see them only scared and humbled, not broken by that shaking: I
never had so ill a thought of those Cities as to despair of their Loyalty to
Me; which mistakes might eclipse, but I never believed malice had quite put out.

I pray God the storm be yet wholly passed over them; upon whom I look, as
Christ did sometime over Jerusalem, as objects of My prayers and tears, with
compassionate grief, foreseeing those severer scatterings which will certainly
befall such as wantonly refuse to be gathered to their duty: fatal blindness
frequently attending and punishing wilful, so that men shall not be able at
last to prevent their sorrows, who would not timely repent of their sin; nor
shall they be suffered to enjoy the comforts, who securely neglect the councels
belonging to their peace. They will find that Brethren in iniquity are not far
from becoming insolent enemies, there being nothing harder then to keep ill
men long in one mind.

Nor is it possible to gain a fair period for those notions which go rather
in a round and circle of fancy, than in a right line of reason tending to the
Law, the only center of public consistency; whither I pray God at last bring
all sides.

Which will easily be done, when we shall fully see how much more happy we are,
to be subject to the known Laws, then to the various wills of any men, seem
they never so plausible at first.

Vulgar compliance with any illegal and extravagant ways, like violent
motions in nature, soon grows weary of it self, and ends in a refractory
sullenness: Peoples rebounds are often in their faces, who first put them upon
those violent strokes.

For the Army (which is so far excusable, as they act according to Soldiers
principles, and interests, demanding Pay and Indemnity) I think it necessary,
in order to the public peace that they should be satisfied, as far as is just;
no man being more prone to consider them then My self ^though they have fought
against Me, yet I cannot but so far esteem that valor and gallantry they have
sometime showed, as to wish I may never want such men to maintain My Self, My
Laws, and My Kingdoms, in such a peace, as wherein they may enjoy their share
and proportion as much as any men.

But thou, O Lord, who art perfect Unity in a sacred Trinity, in mercy behold
those, whom thy Justice has divided.

Deliver me from the strivings of My People, and make Me to see how much they
need My Prayers and pity, who agreed to fight against Me; and (...) are now
ready to fight against one another; to the continuance of My Kingdoms
distractions.

Discover to all sides the ways of peace, from which they have swarved: which
consists not in the divided wills of Parties, but in the point and due
observation of the Laws.

Make Me willing to go whither thou will lead Me by thy providence; and be thou
ever with Me that I may see thy constancy in the worlds variety and changes,

Make me even such as thou would have Me, that I may at last enjoy that
safety and tranquillity which thou alone can give Me.

Divert, J pray thee, O Lord, thy heavy wrath justly hanging over those
populous Cities, whose plenty is prone to add fuel to their luxury, their
wealth to make them wanton, their multitudes tempting them to security, and
their security exposing them to unexpected miseries.

Give them eyes to see, hearts to consider, wills to embrace, and courage to
act those things which belong to thy glory and the public peace, lest their
calamity come upon them as an armed man.

Theach them, That they cannot want enemies who abound in sin, nor shall they
be long un-disarmed and un-destroyed, who, with a high hand persisting to
^ight; against thee and the clear convictions of their own consciences, fight
more against themselves, than ever they did against Me.

Their sins exposing them to thy Justice, their riches too there is injuryes,
their number to Tumults, and their Tumults to confusion.

Though they have with much forwardness helped to destroy Me, yet let not my
fall be their ruin.

Let Me not so much consider, either what they have done, or I have suffered,
(chiefly at first by them) as to forget to imitate My crucified Redeemer, to
plead their ignorance for their pardon; and in my dying extremities to pray to
thee O Father to forgive them, for they know not what they did.

The tears they have denied me in my saddest condition, give them grace to
bestow upon themselves who the less they were for me, the more cause they have
to weep for themselves.

O let not my blood be upon them and their Children, whom the fraud and faction
of some, not the malice of all, have excited to crucify Me.

But thou O Lord, can and wilt (as thou did my Redeemer) both exalt and
perfect me by my sufferings, which have more in them of thy mercy then of man's
cruelty, or thy own Justice.

27* To the Prince of Wales,
SOn, if these Papers, with some others, wherein I have set down the private
reflections of My Conscience, and My most impartial thoughts, touching the
chief passages, which has been most remarkable, or disputed in My late
troubles, come to your hands, to whom they are chiefly designed; they may be so
far useful to you, as to state your judgment aright in what has passed;
whereof a pious is the best use can be made; and they may also give you some
directions, how to remedy the present distempers, and prevent (if God will) the
like for time to come.

It is some kind of deceiving and lessening the injury of my long restraint,
when I find My leisure and solitude have produced something worthy of My self,
and useful to you; That neither you, nor any other, may hereafter measure My
Cause by the Success; nor My Judgment of things, by My misfortunes; which I
count the greater by far, because they have so far lighted upon you, and some
others, whom I have most cause to love, as well as My self* and of whose
unmerited sufferings I have a greater sense, then of Mine own.

But this advantage of wisdom you have above other Princes; that you have
begun and now spent some years of discretion, in the experience of troubles,
and exercise of patience, wherein Piety, and all Virtues, both Moral and
Political, are commonly better planted to a thriving (as Trees set in Winter)
then in the warmth and serenity of times; or amidst those delights, which
usually attend Princes Courts in times of peace and plenty; which are prone,
either to root up all plants of true Virtue and Honor; or to be contented only
with some leaves, and withering formalities of them, without any real fruits,
such as tend to the Public good; for which Princes should always remember
they are borne, and by providence designed.

The evidence of which different education the holy Writ affords us in the
contemplation of David and Rehoboham: The one prepared, by many afflictions,
for a flourishing Kingdom; the other unsoftned by the unparalleled prosperity
of Solomon's Court: and so corrupted to the great diminution, both for Peace,
Honor, and Kingdom, by those flatteries, which are as unseparable from
prosperous Princes, as Flies are from fruit in Summer; whom adversity, like
could weather, drives away.

I had rather you should be Charles Le Bon, then le Grand, good, then great; I
hope God has designed you to both, having so early put you into that exercise
of his Graces, and Gifts bestowed upon you, which may best weed out all vicious
inclinations, and dispose you to those Princely endowments, and employments,
which will most gain the love, and intend the welfare of those, over whom God
shall place you.

With God I would have you begin and end, who is King of Kings; the Sovereign
disposer of the Kingdoms of the world, who pullest down one, and sets up
another.

The best Government, and highest Sove raignty you can attain to, is, to be
subject to him, that the Scepter of his Word and Spirit may rule in your heart.

The true glory of Princes consists in advancing Gods glory in the maintenance
of true Religion and the Churches good; Also in the dispensation of civil
Power, with Justice and Honor to the public Peace.

Piety will make you prosperous; at least it will keep you from being miserable;
nor is he much a loser, that loses all, yet saves his own Soul at last.

To which center of true Happiness God, I trust, has and will graciously
direct all these black lines of Affliction, which he has bin pleased to draw
on Me, and by which he has (I hope) drawn me nearer to himself. You have
already tasted of that cup, whereof I have liberally drank; which I look upon
as Gods physic, having that in healthfulnesse, which it wants in pleasure.
Above all I would have you, as I hope you are already, well-grounded and settled
in your Religion: The best profession of which I have ever esteemed that of the
Church of England, in which you have been educated, yet I would have your own
Judgment and Reason now seal to that sacred bond which education has written,
that it may be judiciously your own Religion, and not other men's custom or
tradition, which you profess.

In this I charge you to persevere, as coming nearest to Gods Word for
Doctrine, and to the primitive examples for Government, with soms little
amendment, which I have otherwhere expressed, and often offered, though in
vain. Your fixation in matters of Religion will not be more necessary for your
soul, then your Kingdoms peace, when God shall bring you to them.

For I have observed, that the Devil of Rebellion does commonly turn himself
into an Angel of Reformation; and the old Serpent can pretend new Lights: When
some men's Consciences accuse them for Sedition and Faction, they stop its mouth
with the name and noise of Religion; when Piety pleads for peace and patience,
they cry out Zeal.

So that, unless in this point You be well settled, you shall never want
temptations to destroy you and yours, under pretensions of forming matters of
Religion; for that seems, even to worst men, as the best and most auspicious
beginning of their worst designs.

Where, besides the Novelty which is taking enough with the Vulgar, every one
has an affection, by seeming forward to an outward Reformation of Religion, to
be thought zealous* hoping to cover those irreligious deformities whereto they
are conscious, by severity of censuring other men's opinions or actions.

Take heed of abetting any Factions: or applying to any public discriminations
in matters of Religion, contrary to what is in your judgment, and the Church
well settled; your partial adhering, as head, to any one side gains you not so
great advantages in some men's hearts (who are prone to be of their Kings
Religion) as it loses you in others; who think themselves, and their
profession first despised, then persecuted by you: Take such a course as may
either with calmnesse and charity quite remove the seeming differences and
offenses by impartiality, or so order affairs in point of Power, that you shall
not need to fear or flatter any Faction. For if ever you stand in need of
them, or must stand to their courtesy, you are undone: The Serpent will devour
the Dove: you may never expect less of loyalty, justice, or humanity, than
from those, who engage into religious Rebellion; Their interest is always made
Gods; under the colors of Piety, ambitious policies march, not only with
greatest security, but applause, as to the populacy; you may hear from them
Jacob's voice, but you shall feel they have Esau's hands.

Nothing seemed less considerable then the Presbyterian Faction in England,
for many years; so compliant they were to public order: nor indeed was their
party great either in Church, or State, as to men's judgments: But as soon as
discontents drove men into Sidings (as ill humors fall to the dissaffected
part, which causes inflammations) so did all, at first, who affected any
novelties, adhere to that Side, as the the most remarkable and specious note of
difference (then) in point of Religion,

All the lesser Factions at first were officious Servants to Presbytery their
great Masters: till time and military success, discovering to each their
peculiar advantages, invited them to part stakes; and, leaving the joint stock
of uniform Religion, pretended each to drive for their Party the trade of
profits and preferments, to the breaking and undoing not only of the Church,
and State, but even of Presbytery it Self, which seemed and hoped at first to
have ingrosed all.

Let nothing seem little or despicable to you in matters which concern Religion
and the churches peace, so as to neglect a speedy reforming an effectual
suppressing Errors and Schisms; which seem at first but as a hand breadth, by
seditious Spirits, as by strong winds, are soon made to cover and darken the
whole Heaven.

When you have done justice to God, your own soul and his Church, in the
profession and preservation both of truth and unity in Religion: the next maine
hinge on which your prosperity will depend, and move, is, that of civil
Justice, wherein the settled Laws of these Kingdoms, to which you are rightly
Heir, are the most excellent rules you can govern by; which by an admirable
temperament give very much to Subjects industry, liberty, and happiness; and
yet reserve enough to the Majesty and prerogative of any King, who ownes his
People as Subjects, not as Slaves; whose subjection, as it preserves their
property, peace, and safety, so it will never diminish your rights, nor their
ingenuous Liberties; which consists in the enjoyment of the fruits of their
industry, and the benefit of those Laws to which themselves have consented.

Never charge your head with such a Crown, as, shall by its heaviness oppress
the whole body the weakness of whose parts cannot return any things of
strength, honor, or safety, to the head, but a necessary debiliatation and
ruin.

Your Prerogative is best showed and exercised in remitting, rather then
exacting the rigor of the Laws; there being nothing worse than legal Tyranny.

In these two points, the preservation of established Religion and Laws, I may
(without vanity) turn the reproach of My sufferings, as to the worlds censure,
into the honor of a kind of Martyrdom, as to the testimony of my own
Conscience; The Troublers of My Kingdoms have nothing else to object against
Me but this, That I prefer Religion and Laws established before those
alterations they propounded.

And so indeed I do, and ever shall, till I am convinced by better Arguments,
then what hitherto has been chiefly used toward Me, Tumults, Armies, and
Prisons.

I cannot yet learn that lesson, nor I hope ever will you, That it is safe for
a King to gratify any Faction with the perturbation of the Laws, in which is
wrapped up the public Interest, and the good of the Community.

How God will deal with Me, as to the removal of these pressures, and
indignities, which his justice, by the very unjust hands of some of My
Subjects, has been pleased to lay upon Me, I cannot tell: nor am I much
solicitous what wrong I suffer from men, while I retain in My foul, what I
believe is right before God.

I have offered all for Reformation and Safety, that in Reason, Honor, and
Conscience I can; reserving only what I cannot consent unto, without an
irreparable injury to My own Soul, the Church, and My People, and to You
also, as the next and undoubted Heir of My Kingdoms.

To which if the divine Providence, to whom no difficulties are insuperable,
shall in his due time after My decease bring you, as I hope he will; My
counsel and charge to You, is; That You seriously consider the former, real,
or objected miscarriages, which might occasion My troubles, that you may avoid
them.

Never repose so much upon any man's single council, fidelity, and discretion,
in managing affairs of the first magnitude, (that is, matters of Religion and
Justice) as to create in Your self, or others, a diffidence of Your own
judgment, which is likely to be always more constant and impartial to the
interests of your Crown and Kingdom then any man's.

Next, beware of exasperating any Factions by the crosnesse, and asperity of
some men's passions, humors, and private opinions; employed by You, grounded
only upon the differences in lesser matters, which are but the skirts and
subb^rbs of religion.

Wherein a charitable connivence and Christian toleration often dissipates
their strength, who^ rougher opposition fortifies; and puts the despised and
oppressed Party, into such Combinations, as may most enable them to get a full
revenge on those they count their Persecutors; who are commonly assisted by
that vulgar commiseration, which attends al, that are said to suffer under the
notion of Religon.

Provided, the differences amount not to an insolent opposition of Laws, and
Government, or Religion established, as to the essentials of them; such motions
and minings are intolerable.

Always keep up solid piety, and those fundamental Truths (which mend both
hearts; and lives of men) with impartial favor and justice.

Take heed that outward circumstances and formalities of Religion devour not
all, or the best encouragements of learning, industry, and piety; but with an
equal eye, and impartial hand, distribute favors and rewards to all men, as
you find them for their real goodness both in abilities and fidelity worthy
and capable of them.

This will be sure to gain You the hearts of the best, and the most too; who,
though they be not good themselves, yet are glad to see the severer ways of
virtue at any time sweetened by temporal rewards.

I have, you see, conflicted with different and opposite Factions, (for so I
must needs call and count all those, that Act not in any conformity to the
Laws established, in Church and State) no sooner have they by force subdued
what they counted their Common Enemy, (that is, all those that have adheered to
the Laws, and to Me) and are secured from that fear, but they are divided to
so high a rivarly, as sets them more at defiance against each other, than
against their first Antagonists.

Time will dissipate all factions when once the rough horns of private men's
covetous and ambitious designs shall discover themselves; which were at first
wrapped up and hidden under the soft and smooth pretensions of Religion,
Reformation, and Liberty: As the Wolf is not less cruel, so he will be more
justly hated, when he shall appear no better than a Wolf under Sheeps clothing.

But, as for the seduced Train of the Vulgar, who in their simplicity follow
those disguises, My charge and council to You, is, That as You need no
palliations for any designs, (as other men,) so that you study really to
exceed (in true and constant demonstrations of goodness, piety, and virtue,
toward the People) even all those men, that make the greatest noise and
ostentations of Religion, so You shall neither fear any detection, (as they
do, who have but the face and mask of goodness) nor shall You frustrate the
just expectations of Your People; who cannot in reason promise themselves so
much good from any subjects noveltis, as from the virtuous constancy of their
King.

When these mountains of congealed factions shall by the sunshine of Gods
mercy, and the splendor of your virtues be thawed and dissipated; and the
abused Vulgar shall have learned, that none are greater Oppressors of their
Estates, Liberties, and Consciences, than those men, that entitle themselves,
The Patrons and Vindicators of them, only to usurp power over them; Let then
no passion betray You to any study of revenge upon those, whose own sin and
folly will sufficiently punish them in due time.

But as soon as the forked arrow of factious emulations is drawn out, use all
princely arts, and clemency, to heal the wounds; that the smart of the cure may
not equal the angnish of the hurt.

I have offered Acts of Indemnity, and Oblivion, to so great a latitude, as
may include all, that can but suspect themselves to be any way obnoxious to the
Laws; and which might serve to exclude all future Jealousies and securities.

I would have You always propense to the same way; when ever it shall be
desired and accepted, let it be granted, not only as an Act of State Policy and
necessity, but of Christian charity and choice.

It is all I have now left Me, a power to forgive those, that have deprived Me
of all; and, I thank God, I have a heart to do it; and joy as much in this
grace, which God has given Me, as in all My former enjoyments; for this is a
greater argument of Gods love to Me, than any prosperity can be.

Be confident (as I am) that the most of all sides who have don amiss, have
don so, not out of malice, but misinformation, or mis-apprehension of things.

None will be more loyal and faithful to Me and you, than those Subjects, who
sensible of their Errors, and our injuries, will feel in their own Souls most
vehement motives to repentance; and earnest desires to make some reparations
for their former defects.

As Your quality sets You beyond any Duel with any Subject; so the Nobleness
of Your mind must raise you above the meditating any revenge, or executing Your
anger upon the many.

The more conscious You shall be to Your own merits, upon your People, the more
prone You will be to expect all love and loyalty from them; and to inflict no
punishment upon them for former miscarriages: You will have more inward
complacency in pardoing one, than in punishing a thousand.

This I write to you, not despairing of Gods mercy, and My Subjects affections
toward you; both which, I hope, you will study to deserve; yet we cannot merit
of God, but by his own mercy.

If God shall see fit to restore Me, and You after Me, to those enjoyments,
which the Laws have assigned to Us, and no Subjects, without an high degree of
guilt and sin can divest us of; then may I have better opportunity, when I
shall be so happy to see you in peace, to let you more fully understand the
things that belong to Gods glory, your own honor, and the kingdoms peace.

But, if You never see My face again, and God will have Me buried in such a
barbarous Imprisonment and obscurity, (which the perfecting some men's designs
require) wherein few hearts that love me are permitted to exchange a word, or a
look with Me; I do require and entreat You as Your Father, and Your King, that
You never suffer Your heart to receive the least check against, or disaffection
from the true Religion established in the Church of England.

I tell You, I have tried it, and after much search, and many disputes, have
concluded it to be the best in the world; not only in the Community, as
Christian, but also in the special notion, as Reformed; keeping the middle way
between the pomp of superstitious Tyranny, and the meannesse of fantastique
Anarchy.

Not but that (the draught being excellent as to the maine, both for Doctrine
and Government, in the Church of England) some lines, as in very good figures,
may happily need some sweetning, or pollishing; which might here have easily
been done by a safe and gentle hand; if some men's precipitancy had not
violently demanded such rude Alterations, as would have quite destroyed all the
beauty and proportions of the whole.

The scandal of the late troubles, which some may object, and urge to you
against the Protestant Religion established in England, is easily Answered to
them, or Your own thoughts in this, That scarce any one who has been a
Beginner, or an active prosecutor of this late War against the Church, the
Laws, and Me, either was, or is a true Lover, Embracer, or Practiser of the
Protestant Religion, established in England: which neither give such rules, nor
ever before set such examples.

It Is true, some heretofore had the boldness to present threatening Petitions
to their Princes and Parliaments, which others of the same Faction (but of
worse Spirits) have now put in execution: but let not counterfeit and
disorderly zeal abate Your value and esteem of true piety; both of them are to
be known by their fruits; the sweetness of the Vine and Fig Tree is not to be
despised, though the Brambles and Thorns should pretend to bear Figs and Grapes
thereby to rule over the Trees*

Nor would I have You to entertain any aversation or dislike of Parliaments;
which, in their right constitution with Freedom and Honor, will never injure
or diminish Your greatness, but will rather be as interchangings of love,
loyalty, and confidence, between a Prince and His People.

Nor would the events of this black Parliament have been other then such
(however much biassed by Factions in the Elections) if it had heen preserved
from the insolencyes of popular dictates, and tumultuary impressions: The sad
effects of which will, no doubt make all Parliaments after this more cautious
to preserve that Freedom, and Honor, which belongs to such Assemblies (when
once they have fully shaken off this yoke of Vulgar encroachment) since the
public interest consists in the mutual and common good both of Prince and
People.

Nothing can be more happy for all, than in fair, grave, and Honorable ways
to contribute their Counsels in Common, enacting all things by public
consent; without tyranny or Tumults. We must not starve our selves, because
some men have surfeited of wholesome food.

And if neither I, nor You, be ever restored to Our Rights, but God, in his
severest justice, will punish My Subjects with continuance in their sin, and
suffer them to be deluded with the prosperity of their wickedness; I hope God
will give Me, and You, that grace, which, will teach and enable Us, to want, as
well as to wear a Crown; which is not worth taking up, or enjoying upon
sordid, dishonorable, and irreligious terms.

Keep you to true principles of piety, virtue, and honor, you shall never want
a Kingdom.

A principal point of your honor will consist in your deferring all respect,
love, and protection to your Mother, My Wife; who has many ways deserved well
of Me, and chiefly in this, that (having been a means to bless Me with so
many hopeful Children; all which, with their Mother, I recommend to your love,
and care) She has been content with incomparable magnanimity and patience to
suffer both for, and with Me; and you.

My prayer to God Almighty, is, (what ever becomes of Me, who am, I thank God,
wrapped up and fortified in My own Innocence, and his grace) that he would be
pleased to make you an Anchor, or Harbor rather, to these tossed and
weather-beaten Kingdoms; a Repairer by your wisdom, Justice, piety, and
valor, of what the folly and wickedness of some m^n have so far ruined, as
to leave nothing entire in Church or State; to the Crown, the Nobility, the
Clergy, or the Commons; either as to Laws, Liberties, Estates, Order, Honor,
Conscience, or Lives.

When they have destroyed Me, (for I know not how far God may permit the
malice and cruelty of My Enemies to proceed, and such apprehensions some men's
words and actions have already given Me) as I doubt not but My blood will cry
aloud for vengeance to heaven; so I beseech God not to pour out his wrath upon
the generality of the people, who have either deserted Me, or engaged against
Me, through the artifice and hypocrisy of their Leaders; whose inward horror
will be their first Tormenter, nor will they escape exemplary judgments.

For those that loved Me, I pray God, they may have no miss of Me, when I am
gone; so much I wish and hope, that all good Subjects may be satisfied with the
blessings of Your presence and virtues.

For those that repent of any defects, in their duty toward Me, as I freely
forgive them in the word of a Christian King, so I believe You will find them
truly zealous, to repay with interest that Loyalty and love to you, which was
due to Me.

In sum, what good I intended, do you perform; when God shall give You
power: much good I have offered, more I purposed to church and State, if times
had been capable of it.

The deception will soon vanish, and the Vizards will fall off apace; This
mask of Religion on the face of Rebellion (for so it now plainly appears,
since My restraint and cruel usage, that they fought not for Me, as was
pretended) will not long serve to hide some men's deformities.

Happy times I hope attend you; wherein Your Subjects (by their miseries) will
have learned, That Religion to their God, and Loyalty to their King, cannot be
parted without both their sin and their infelicity

And if God bless You, and establish your Kingdoms in righteousness, your
Soul in true Religion, and your honor in the love of God and your People.

And if God will have disloyalty perfected by My destruction; let My memory
ever, with My name, live in You; as of your Father, that loves you: and once a
KING of three flourishing Kingdoms; whom God thought fit to honor, not only
with the Scepter and government of them, but also with the suffering many
indignities, and an untimely death for them* while I studied to preserve the
rights of the Church, the power of the Laws, the honor of My Crown, the
privilege of Parliaments, the liberties of My People, and My own Conscience;
which, I thank God, is dearer to Me than a thousand Kingdoms.

I know God can, I hope he yet will, restore Me to My Rights: I cannot despair
either of his mercy, or of My Peoples love and pity.

At worst, I trust I shall but go before you to a better Kingdom, which God
has prepared for Me, and Me for it, through My Savior Jesus Christ, to whose
mercies I commend you and all mine.

Farewell, till we meet, if not on Earth, yet in Heaven.
Meditations upon Death, after the Votes of Non-Addresses, and His Majesty's
Closer Jmprisonment in Carisbrooke-Castle.
AS I have leisure enough, so I have cause more than enough, to meditate upon,
and prepare for My Death: for, I know, there are but few steps between the
Prisons and grave of Princes.

It is Gods indulgence, which gives Me the space; but Man's cruelty, that gives
Me the sad occasions for these thoughts.

For, besides the common burden of mortality, which lies upon Me, as a Man; I
now bear the heavy load of other men's ambitions, fears, jealousies, and cruel
passions, whose envy or enmity against Me makes their own lives seem deadly to
them, while I enjoy any part of Mine.

I thank God, My prosperity made Me not wholly a Stranger to the contemplations
of mortality:

Those are never unseasonable, since this is always uncertain: Death being an
eclipse, which often happineth as well in clear, as cloudy days.

But My now long and sharp adversity has so reconciled in Me those natural
Antipathies between Life and Death, which are in all men, that I thank God, the
common terrors of it are dispelled; and the special horour of it, as to My
particular, much allayed: for, although my death at present may justly be
represented to Me with all those terrible aggravations, which the policy of
cruel and implacable enemies can put upon it, (affairs being drawn to the
very dregs of malice) yet I bless God, I can look upon all those stings, as
unpoysonous, though sharp; since My Redeemer has eith er pulled them out, or
given Me the Antidote of his death against them, which, as to the immaturity,
unjustice, shame scorn, and cruelty of it, exceeded what ever I can fear.

Indeed, I never did find so much the life of Religion, the feast of a good
Conscience, and the brazen wall of a judicious integrity and constancy, as
since I came to these closer conflicts with the thoughts of Death.

I am not so old, as to be weary of life; nor (I hope) so bad, as to be either
afraid to dye, or ashamed to live: true, I am so afflicted, as might make Me
sometime even desire to die; if I did not consider, that it is the greatest
glory of christians life to dye daily, in conquering by a lively faith, and
patient hopes of a better life, those partial and quotidian deaths, which
kills us (as it were) by peicemeales and make us over-live our own FATES; while
we are deprived of health, honor, liberty, power, credit, safety, or estate;
and those other comforts of dearest relations, which are as the life of our
lives.

Though, as a KING, I think My self to live in nothing temporal so much as in
the love and good will of My People; for which, as I have suffered many deaths,
so I hope I am not in that point as yet wholly dead: notwithstanding, My
Enemies have used all the poison of falsity and violence of hostility to
destroy, first the love and Loyalty, which is in My Subjects; and then all that
content of life in Me, which from these I chiefly enjoyed.

Indeed, they have left Me but little of life, and only the husk and shell (as
it were) which their further malice and cruelty can take from Me; having
bereaved Me of all those worldly comforts, for which life it self seems
desirable to men. But, O My Soul! think not that life too long, or tedious,
wherein God gives thee any opportunities, if not to do, yet to suffer with
such Christian patience and magnanimity in a good Cause, a sare the greatest
honor of our lives, and the best improvement of our deaths.

I know, that in point of true Christian valor, it argues pusillanimity to
desire to die out of weariness of life; and a want of that heroic greatness
of spirit which becomes a Christian in the patient and generous sustaining
those afflictions, which as shaddows necessarily attend us, while we are in
this body; and which are lessened or enlarged as the Sun of our prosperity
moves higher or lower: whose total absence is best recompensed with the dew of
Heaven.

The assaults of affliction may be terrible; like Sampson's Lion, but they
yield much sweetness to those, that dare to encounter and overcome them; who
know how to overlive the witherings of their Gourds without discontent or
peevishness, while they may yet converse with God.

That I must dye as a man, is certain; that I may dye a King, by the hands of
My own Subjects, a violent, sudden and barbarous death; in the strength of my
years, in the midst of My Kingdoms; My Friends and loving Subjects being
helples Spectators; My Enemies insolent Revilers and Triumphers over me;
living, dying, and dead, is so probable in humane reason; that God has taught
me not to hope otherwise as to man's cruelty; however, I despair not of Gods
infinite marcy.

I know my life is the object of the Devils and wicked men's malice; but yet
under Gods sole custody and disposal: Whom I do not think to flatter for
longer life by seeming prepared to dye, but I humbly desire to depend upon him,
and to submit to his will both in Life and death, in what order soever he is
pleased to lay them out to me. I confess it is not easy for me to contend
with those many horrors of death, wherewith God suffers me to be tempted; which
are equally horrid, either in the suddenness of a barbarous Assasination; or
in those greater formalities, whereby my Enemies (being more solemnly cruel)
will, it may be, seek to add (as those did who Crucified Christ) the mockery of
Justice, to the cruelty of malice: That I may be destroyed, as with greater
pomp and artifice, so with les pity, it will be but a necessary policy to make
my death appear as an act of Justice, don by Subjects upon their Sovereign,
who know that no Law of God or Man invests them with any power of Judicature
without me, much less against me: and who, being sworn, and bound by all that
is sacred before God and Man, to endeavor my preservation, must pretend
Justice to cover their perjury.

It is, indeed, a sad fate for any man to have his Enemies to be Accusers,
Parties, and Judges; but most desperate, when this is acted by the insolence of
Subjects against their Sovereign; wherein those, who have had the chiefest
hand, and are most guilty of contriving the public Troubles, must by shedding
my blood seem to wash their own hands of that innocent blood whereof they are
now most evidently guilty before God and Man; and I believe in their own
Consciences too, while they carried on unreasonable Demands; First by Tumults,
after by Armies. Nothing makes mean spirits more towardly-cruel in managing
their usurped power against their lawful Superiors than this, the Guilt of
their unjust Usurpation: notwithstanding those specious and popular pretensions
of Justice against Delinquents applied only to disguize at first the
monstrousness of their designs, who despaired, indeed, of possessing the power
and profits of the Vineyard, till the heir whose right it is, be cast out and
slain.

With them my greatest fault must be, that I would not either destroy My self
with the Church and State by my Word, or not suffer them to do it unresisted by
the Sword; whose covetous ambition no Concessions of Mine could ever yet either
satisfy, or abate.

Nor is likely they will ever think, that Kingdom of brambles which some men
seek to erect (at once, weak, sharp, and fruitless, either to God or Man) is
like to thrive till watered with the Royal blood of those, whose right the
Kingdom is. Well, Gods will be don, I doubt not but my Innocence will find him
both my protector, and my Advocate who is my only Judge, whom I own as King
of Kings, not only for the eminency of his power and Majesty above them; but
also for that singular care and protection, which he has over them: who knows
them to be exposed to as many dangers (being the greatest Patrons of Law,
Justice, Order, and Religion on earth) as there be either men or Devils; which
love confusion.

Nor will he suffer those Men long to prossper in their Babel, who build it
with the bones, and cement it with the blood of their Kings.

I am confident they will find Avengers of my death amongst themselves: the
injuries I have sustained from them shall be first punished by them, who agreed
in nothing so much as in opposing Me.

Their impatience to bear the loud cry of My blood, shall make them think no
way better to expiate it, than by shedd ing theirs, who, with them, most
thirsted after Mine.

The sad confusions following my destruction, are already presaged and
confirmed to Me by those I have lived to see since My troubles; in which God
alone (who only could) has many ways pleaded my cause; not suffering them to
go unpuin shed, whose confederacy in sin was their only security; who have
cause to fear that God will both further divide, and by mutual vengeance,
afterward destroy them,

My greatest conquest of Death is from the power and love of Christ, who has
swallowed up death in the Victory of his Resurrection, and the glory of his
Ascension.

My next comfort is, that he gives me not only the honor to imitate his
example in suffering for righteousness sake, (though obscured by the foulest
charges of Tyranny and injustice) but also, that charity, which is the noblest
revenge upon, and victory over My Destroyers: By which, I thank God, I can both
forgive them, and pray for them, that God would not impute My blood to them
further then to convince them, what need they have of Christ's blood to wash
their souls from the guilt of shedding Mine.

At present, the will of My Enemies seems to be their only rule, their power
the measure, and their success the Exactor, of what they please to call
Justice; while they flatter themselves with the fancy of their own safety by
my danger, and the security of their lives and designs by My Death:
forgetting, that as the greatest temptations to sin are wrapped up in seeming
prosperities, so the severest vengeance of God are then most accomplished, when
men are suffered to complete their wicked purposes. I bless God, I pray not so
much, that this bitter cup of a violent death may pass from Me, as that of his
warth may pass from all those whose hands, by deserting Me, are sprinkled, or
by acting and consenting to My death, are embrued with My blood.

The will of God has confined, and concluded Mine; I shall have the pleasure
of dying, without any pleasure of desired vengeance.

This I think becomes a Christian toward his Enemies, and a King toward his
subjects.

They cannot deprive Me of more than I am content to lose, when God sees fit by
their hands to take it from me; whose mercy, I believe, will more then
infinitely recompense what ever by man's injustice, he is pleased to deprive me
of.

The glory attending my death will far surpass all I could enjoy, or
conceive in life.

I shall not want the heavy and envyed Crowns of this world, when my God has
mercifully Crowned and Consummated his graces with Glory, and exchanged the
shadows of my earthly Kingdoms among men, for the substance of that Heavenly
Kingdom with himself.

For the censures of the world; I know the sharp and necessary tyranny of my
Destroyers will sufficiently confute the calumnies of tyranny against me; I am
persuaded I am happy in the judicious love of the ablest and best of my
Subjects, who do not only pity and pray for me, but would be content even to
dye with me, or for me.

These know how to excuse my failings; as a man, and yet to retain and pay
their duty to me as their King; there being no religious necessity binding any
Subjects by pretending to punish, infinitely to exceed, the faults and errors
of their Princes; especially there, where more then sufficient satisfaction
has been made to the public; the enjoyment of which, private ambitions have
hitherto frustrated.

Others, I believe, of softer tempers, and less advantaged by my ruin, do
already feel sharp convictions, and some remorse in their consciences: where
they cannot but see the proportions of their evil dealings against me in the
measure of Gods retaliations upon them who cannot hope long to enjoy their own
thumbs and toes, having under pretense of paring others nails, bin so cruel as
to cut off their chiefest strength.

The punishment of the more insolent and obstinat may be like that of Korah and
his accomplices (at once mutining against both Prince and Priest) in such a
method of divine justice, as is not ordinary; the earth of the lowest and
meanest people opening upon them, and swallowing them up in a just disdain of
their ill-gotten and worse-used Authority: upon whose support and strength they
chiefly depended for their building and establishing their designs against me,
the Church and State.

My chiefest comfort in death consists in My peace, which I trust, is made with
God; before whose exact tribunal I shall not fear to appear, as to the Cause so
long disputed by the sword, between me and my causlesse Enemies, where I doubt
not but his righteous judgment wll con^ute their fallacy, who from worldly
success ^rather like Sophisters, than sound Christians) ^raw those popular
conclusions for Gods ap^robation of their actions; whose wise providence (we
know) often permits many events which ^s revealed word (the only clear, safe and
fixed rule of good actions and good consciences) in no sort approves.

I am confident the Justice of My Cause, and clearness of my conscience before
God and toward my people will carry me as much above them in Gods decision, as
their successes have lifted them above me in the vulgar opinion who consider
not, that many times those undertakings of men are lifted up to heaven in the
prosperity and applause of the world, whose rise is from Hell, as to the
injuriousnesse and oppression of the design. The prosperous winds which often
fill the sails of Pirates, does not justify their piracy and rapine.

I look upon it with infinite more content and quiet of Soul, to have been
worsted in my enforced contestation for, and Vindication of the Laws of the
Land, the freedom and honor of Parliaments; the rights of My Crown, the just
liberty of My Subjects, and the true Christian Religion in its Doctrine,
Government and due encouragements, then if I had, with the greatest advantages
of success, overborn them all, as some men have now evidently done, whatever
designs they at first pretended.

The prayers and patience of my Friends and loving Subjects will contribute
much to the sweetning of this bitter cup, which I doubt not but I shall more
cheerefuly take and drink as from Gods hand (if it must be so) than they can
give it me, whose hands are unjustly and barbarously lifted up against me.

And as to the last event, I may seem to owe more to my Enemies, than my
Friends; while those will put a period to the finnes and sorrows attending this
miserable life wherewith these desire, I might still contend.

I shall be more then Conqueror through Christ enabling me: for whom I have
hitherto suffered: as he is the Author of Truth, Order, and Peace; for all
which I have been forced to contend against Error, Faction and confusion.

If I must suffer a violent death with my Savior; it is but mortality crowned
with martyrdom: where the debt of death, which I owe for sin to nature,
shall be raised, as a gift of faith and patience offered to God.

Which I humbly beseech him mercifully to accept; and although Death be the
wages of my own sin, as from God, and the effect of other sins, as men,
both against God and me; yet as I hope my own sins are so remitted, that
they shall be no ingredients to imbitter the cup of my death, so I desire God
to pardon their sins, who are most guilty of my destruction.

The Trophies of my charity will be more glorious and durable over them, than
their illmanaged victories over me.

Though their sin be prosperous, yet they had need to be penitent, that they
may be pardoned: Both which, I pray God they may obtain: that my temporal
Death unjustly inflicted by them, may not be revenged by Gods just inflicting
eternal death upon them: for I look upon the temporal destruction of the
greatest King, as far less deprecable, than the eternal damnation of the
meanest Subject.

Nor do I wish other, than the safe bringing of the ship to shore, when they
have cast me overboard; though it be very strange, that Mariners can find no
other means to appease the storm, themselves have raised, but by drowning
their Pilot.

I thank God, my Enemies cruelty cannot prevent my preparation; whose malice in
this I shall defeat, that they shall not have the satisfaction to have
destroyed my Soul with my Body; of whose salvation, while some of them have
themselves seemed, and taught others to despair, they have only discovered
this, that they do not much desire it.

Whose uncharitable and cruel Restraints, denying me even the assistance of
any of my Chaplains, has rather enlarged, than any way obstructed my access
to the Throne of Heaven.

Where thou dwell, O King of Kings; who fillest Heaven and Earth, who art
the fountain of eternal life, in whom is no shadow of death.

Thou O God, art both the just Afflicter of Death upon ns, and the merciful
Savior of us in it, and from it.

Yea, it is better for us to be dead to our selves and live in thee, than by
living in our selves to be deprived of thee.

O make the many bitter agravations of my death as a Man, and a King, the
opportunities and advantages of thy special graces and comforts in my Soul,
as a Christian.

If thou Lord wilt be with me, I shall neither fear nor feel any evil, though
I walk through the valey of the shadow of death.

To contend with death is the work of a weak and mortal man; to overcome it is
the grace of thee alone, who art the Almighty and immortal God.

O My Savior, who know what it is to dye with Me, as a Man; make Me to know
what it is to pass through death to life with thee My God.

Though I dye, yet I know, that thou my Redeemer live for ever: though thou
slayest Me, yet thou have encouraged me to trust in thee for eternal life.

O withdraw not thy favor from me, which is better than life.

O be not far from me, for I know not how near a violent and cruel death is
to Me.

As thy Omniscience, O God, discovers; so thy Omnipotence can defeat the
designs of those who have, or shall conspire my destruction.

O show me thy goodness of thy will, through the wickedness of theirs.

Thou give me leave as a man to pray, that this cup may pass from me; but
thou have taught Me as a Christian by the example of Christ to add, not my
will, but thine be done.

Yea Lord, let our wills be one, by wholly resolving mine into thine: let not
the desire of life in me be so great, as that of doing or suffering thy will in
either life or death.

As I believe thou have forgiven all the errors of my life, so I hope thou will
save me from the terrors of my death.

Make me content to leave the worlds nothing, that I may come really to enjoy
all in thee, who have made Christ unto me in life, gain, and in death,
advantage.

Though my destroyers forget their duty to thee and me, yet do not thou, O
Lord, forget to be merciful to them.

For, what profit is there in my blood, or in their gaining my Kingdoms, if
they lose their own Souls?

Such as have not only resisted my just Power, but wholly usurped and turned it
against my self, though they may deserve, yet let them not receive to
themselves damnation.

Thou made thy Son a Saviou to many that Crucified Him, while at once he
suffered violently by them, and yet willingly for them.

O let the voice of his hloud be heard for My murderers, louder than the cry
of mine against them.

Prepare them for thy mercy by due convictions of their sin, and let them not
at once deceive and damme their own Souls by fallacio^s pretentions of
Justice in destroying me, while the conscience of their unjust usurpation of
power against me, chiefly tempts them to use all extremities against me.

O Lord, thou know I have found their mercies to me as very false, so very
cruel, who pretending to preserve me, have meditated nothing but my ruin.

O deal not with them as bloodthirsty and deceitful men, but overcome their
cruelty with thy compassion and my charity.

And when thou make inquisition for My blood, O sprinkle their polluted, yet
penitent Souls with the blood of thy Son, that thy destroying Angel may
pass over them.

Though they think my Kingdoms on earth too little to entertain at once both
them and me, yet let the capacious Kingdom of thy infinite mercy at last
receive both me and my enemies.

When being reconciled to thee in the blood of the same Redeemer, we shall live
far above these ambitious desires, which beget such mortal enmities.

When their hands shall be heaviest, and cruellest upon me, O let me fall into
the arms of thy tender and eternal mercies.

That what is cut off of my life in this miserable moment: may be repaiedin thy
ever, blessed eternity.

Lord, let thy Servant depart in peace, for my eyes have seen thy salvation.

Vota dabunt, quae bella negarunt.
FINIS.
