A Salutation to the little flock,
Who do choose Christ to be their Rock.
Lift up your heads in the light of Christ, for the day of your redemption
draws near.

With a message from the Lord alone;
For the healing of the sick and wounded one.
And an exhortation unto all to give up unto the death, that they may be
crowned with life.

DEar and tender Babes, Lambs and Children, whom my heavenly Father has
begotten unto himself, by the immortal seed of the word of life, which lives
and abides for ever. Unto you do I send greeting in the overflowings of my
heavenly Fathers love, which he has caused to stream forth in me, toward you.
Dear hearts you are so near and dear unto me, that I have been and am overcome
with love, as I have felt many of you in the bosom of the Father, which is
open to receive you, as you sink down out of your selves; for that is the Babes
state, unto which the Kingdom belongs, which is not in word but in power,
whereby ye are preserved. Oh! dear Lambs, in the perfect love of my God, feel
me; for in that am I drawn forth to salute and kiss you one by one, even with
the pure sincere undefiled lips of the love of God: Oh! let me have a place in
your hearts, in that which never changes, that we may not love in word, or in
show: but indeed and in truth, that we may be Epistles written in one another
hearts, that all may know that we are true disciples in deed, because we love
one another* for love is the fulfilling of the Law, and they that dwell in
love, dwell in God, and God dwells in them: the Lord has filled my cup with
his loving kindness. Oh! drink a full draught with me, for I am as if I were
sick with love: Oh! the weight of the glorious love of my God with me feel,
that it may press through your vessels, that your tongues may be touched and
your lips may be opened that living songs and Hallelujahs may arise unto the
living God; for praises becomes his house, its a comely thing to sing praises
unto the Lord in the Spirit, and with understanding also: Oh! let the high
praises of the Lord be in your mouths, and then the two edged sword will be in
your hands, for they are inseparable, for the Lord our God is fearful in his
praises; by them are the righteous ladded and the wicked astonished and
tormented; for when the righteous seed sings for joy of heart, the wicked shall
weep and howl for vexation of Spirit; and so the Spirit of truth which is to
lead you into all truth, and so into the joy of the Master, the which shall be
the condemnation and torment of the wicked, and the day of their destruction
draws near; for the Lord will plead with all flesh, by his sword and by fire
and a consumption is determined by the Lord upon all flesh, and he will
terribly shake the Earth, that all may be overturned and removed that may be
shaken, that he may be the All in the rising of his glorious day which is at
hand: Oh! be not daunted or dismayed although the Sea may swell, the Lion like
nature roar, and the Devil may rage yet they shall never prevail against the
least Babes, as they abide in the faith: but the least shall be as David and
the little one, as a strong Nation: and although the troubles and trials of the
righteous seed be many, so that sorrow may endure for a night, yet joy will
come in the morning; that those which suffer with Christ shall reign with him,
over all the powers of Hell and darkness, both within and without. Little
Children wait to see and feel him to arise in your own perticulers, who is to
set our foot upon the Egiptian Sea of darkness, from whence the boisterous
waves of all strife and contention arise about outward things, and outward
forms of worship, wherein the true power of God has been wanting, that there
may be no more appearance of Sea, as to disturb your peace; but his foot you
may feel to keep it under, until the tongue of that Egiptian Sea be dried up;
that there may be no Mountains of dry Land in your way; but that one foot may
stand on the Earth also, that the Mountain of his holiness may be established
on the top of the Mountains, that the Sea of glass mingled with fire, a River as
clear as Christ all flowing from the Throne of God (ye may see and feel,) where
the Ancient of days sits, who will judge the whore, the false Prophet and the
Beast (which is all that may be numbered up which is on the man's part) that man
may cease from his labor and sore travel, that peace may be upon Earth and all
the glory may be to God on high, that the good will may be to men, that no root
of bitterness may ever more arise, that sends forth bitter springs, which
occasioneth the meek to fall, as they drink thereof: therefore, dear Children,
drink ye always of the pure, fresh, pleasant springs, that arise from the pure
Fountain of all virtue: go not forth; but in the light dwell, and then shall
you be salted, seasoned and swadled with the love of God, that the banner of
his love may be over you, and then the noise of war will be no more heard
amongst the Camp of God (on man's part,) for the battle is the Lords and he will
fight it, therefore fear not, but stand still and see the salvation of God: for
the Lord will bring to pass his work, his great work, his Act, his strange
Act; for the Kingdoms of this World shall become the Kingdoms of the Lord and
his Christ; yea he shall rule amongst the Children of men, for the Kingdom is
his, the power, glory, honor, victory, triumph and pure refreshings are his;
Oh! feel his comforts, delighting your Souls, that your joy may be full, that
your glorying and whole delight may be in the Lord alone; that we may not be
our own in any thing, because the Lord has purchased us with his own blood:
Oh! therefore let us give up wholly unto him, that he may glorify himself in our
bodies, in our spirits and souls, which are the Lords; that he may make a quick
work on the Earthly, and cut it short in his righteousness, that Sion may be
his glory and Jerusalem the praise of the whole Earth: Oh! dearly beloved of
the Lord, how great is the work of the Lord, which he has begun to work in you
and for (...) Oh! you dear ones, who have received a measure of his spirit, as
an earnest of your inheritance, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of
redemption: Dear Lambs in the spirit, wait and dwell, that it be nor grieved or
quenched, that over all it may arise and cover you in this day of battle, that
the knowledge of the Lord may be Armor of proof, on the right hand, and on the
left, that salvation may be unto you for walls and bulworks; for assuredly as
ye abide in the spirit (which is the name that is given for salvation;) the
gates of hell shall never prevail against you: but ye shall be like mount Sion
which shall never be removed, and ye shall see the mighty God of Jacob will
carry on his own work, until he has accomplished it unto his praise, which
work will be glorious as he brings us into the unity of the Faith; into the
fullness of the measure and stature of Christ, unto that perfect man; then shall
all that is in part be done away, and then shall the rest be glorious in the
Lord of Sabbaths. Ah! travel on, travel on in the growth, in the life which is
eternal, that ye may grow from strength to strength, until ye appear before him
in Sion; that Sion's songs may be sounded forth in the living land: all that
can be said is little to what the Lord God has prepared and laid up in store,
for all them that dwell in his fear. Blessed are all those that fear the living
God all ways, they shall read and witness it Excellent, and as you sink down
into the love of God, you will feel these lines deep and weighty, for truly
friends, as they did arise in my heart, the extent did open so largely in the
overcomings of Gods love: that my heart was melted, and my bowels sof^ned and
melted, that my eyes were filled with tears, that the glory of the Lord should
be so largely revealed unto so unworthy a creature as I, who was so deeply
plunged in sin and iniquity, as I was in time past; that his love should arise
so abundantly as to cover such a multitude of sins as I had committed against
him, and that the Lord God should manifest himself so graciously in Christ,
reconcileing and not imputing: Oh dearly beloved, in this wonderful love of our
God, feel me, that in this his great love we may all dwell: that we may be all
like minded one toward another, that there may be no striking at our fellow
servants etc. But if any one be overtake^ in a fault, you that are spiritual,
restore such an one with the spirit of meekness for the wrath of man works
not the righteousness of God; therefore strive not to overcome evil with evil,
but strive to overcome evil with good; be gentle, courteous and merciful, as
your heavenly Father is, and walk in love, for it is a most excellent way; for
love seeks not her own, but the good of all: love suffers all things, and
endures all things, and it will seek to cover, but not uncover the nakedness:
it is the affectionate part which tosseth the creature either above all, or
below all, as it bares rule: therefore dear Lambs, in the unchangeable love of
God in Christ Jesus, all dwell that ye may be rooted, grounded and established
in the present truth; that you may follow the Lamb, whethersoever he goes,
that the true fellowship may never be broken, Amen says my Soul.

Oh! you weaklings, sick and wounded ones, who are ready to cry out in the
purity of your spirits, that there is none like unto you: ye see your selves so
beset with temptations, that with little David, you are ready to cry out, that
surely you shall one day fall by the Enemi^s hands: Oh! read with me the
mystery of the Parable in the tenth of Luke. the 30th. the 16th. and the 19th.
There was a certain man, that went from the pure holy seed in his own
particular, and then being from the new and living way in the particular (which
is Christ the seed where the theif cannot enter,) where he met with the
reasoning, disp^^ing, doubting and questioning part; by the which he was robbed
and stripped of his faith, strength, hope, and confidence, that he was deeply
wounded and more then half dead, and being in great distress, the enemy in
such a case will seek to lead forth, to look our for help where none is to
befound: or else to despair as if no help were to be had, persuading poor
bruised and wounded Lazarus to go to the rich gluttons gate, who glutteth
himself by feeding of the tree of knowledge and a profession of what the dear
Saints and servants of God enjoy; for that was his clothing and riches,
wherein there was not one crum of life to refresh poor Lazarus withal: but the
dogs that fed upon the crumbs that fell from the rich man's table, licked the
sores, but never reached or refreshed the life; then seeing there was no help
without Christ the life, then did Lazarus die to all perishing food; and when
there was none found to help or relieve, then did the good Samaritan, Christ
the life appear, which is full of heavenly Oil, Balm and sweet odours, even
the fountain of all virtue and fullness, in whom there is healing for every
disease; therefore hear you diseased of the land, you poor helpless ones: the
cry of my soul has been greatly unto the Lord on your behalf. Oh! fear and
hear, for this is the answer that I recieved from the Lord on your behalf (as I
lay upon my bed;) Look up unto me all ye ends of the earth and be ye saved,
says the Lord God of Hosts: and as the Serpent was lifted up in the
wilderness, even so is the Son of man lifted up in this his day, that all that
are diseased or wounded may be healed by looking upon him: therefore, dear
Friends, look not at your weakness or wounds, for the looking at them, will
cause you to be more weak and wounded: but look up unto the Lord, for in him is
everlasting strength: for I know one that has passed through the fire, and
has endured the flames, that he has cried out as it were in the belly of
Hell, who desired water to quench the flames, and having it in a glass, he
dropped it down to lay the heat thereof, but his strength failed him, and his
flesh failed him, and his heart has failed him, but the Lord his God never
failed him, who in that needful time sent his faithful messenger, saying unto
me in the word of the Lord, thou shall not die; (...) the Lord will spare thee
for the seeds sake; so he sent forth his word and healed and recovered me out
of the horrible pit, and has set me upon the Rock, and has put a new song
into my mouth, which causes me to sound forth the high praise of the living
God, as with the sound of a trumpet in the firmament of his power, who is
ascended on high to lead Captivity captive, that his liveing peace may be over
the earthly, and his good will in me is strong toward the afflicted and
bruised, that they which have been hurt may be recovered. Oh! dear friends,
feel me, that the same mind may be in you which is in Christ Jesus: for my
soul is in travel, that no form may abide in you, but what is in Christ the
light, that whatever is done by you, may be done in the name of the Lord Jesus,
that you may be birds of Paradise, and not of the fire; that you may have no
nest, hole or place to rest in; but the eternal fould of life, where no
devouring beast nor bird of prey can enter; that you may all shine in his life,
that poor Lazarus may know that he is carried into the bosom of the Father,
for if he goes unto the rich man, which feeds on the tree of knowledge, which
is much desirable to the eye which goes forth from the tree of life, there he
must lie full of sores; for the healing is in Christ the life: the knowledge in
the sight without the enjoyment of the life heals not (mark that.) Therefore
I say again, look up unto Christ, the life only; for he arises with healing
in his wings; therefore let no object draw forth your minds from the Lord, and
then his perfect peace you may enjoy; to that which you are called, in the
which peace the Lord God of peace establish you, Amen. So be it, says my
Soul. Then shall the man's part be abased, and the glory of the Lord over all
be exalted: which shall astonish the Horse and the Rider, and wholly subject
the power of darkness, and thus shall deliverance come by the Lord alone,
therefore I say again, eye the Lord and stand still in the Faith, and make not
haste, neither be you high minded but fear, and the Lord will preserve you to
the end.

Given forth in the pure love and fear of God, in the County Goal of
Northampton, being twelve steps under ground: the 17 day of the eight Month
1663. Where I with sixteen more suffer for the testimony of Jesus. But the Lord
does and will plead the cause of the Innocent in the hearts of his and our
Enemics. Friends, who are here in this Prison are well, and the Lords presence
appears amongst us, who is as a fountain never drawn dry; who causes his
living cup to overflow, to the praise of his glorious Name, which is the Ark of
our safety.


Your dear Friend and Brother in the unchangeable love of God. JOHN SAMM.

THe name of the Lord God is a strong tower, and as an ointment powered forth: I
have witnessed it so, that in all my trials and temptations in his name has
been plentious redemption, for it has preserved and delivered me six times out
of the common Goales, wherein I was cast for the testimony thereof: that I
never yet paid penny Fees to any Jailer, or any other man upon that account;
nor durst I ever entertain a thought in my heart to think any imprisonments
long although I have been strictly detayned for a long time together, neither
did I ever entertain any fear into my heart, what might be done to my body, or
outward estate, or my dear children, who are as dear as my life: but when my
goods has been spoiled, as taking away three good Horses and three of the best
milch kine I had, for less then one years claim of that which the hireling
Priest called his due; because I could not for conscience sake put into his
mouth, which if I could have done, (I do believe) I might have been excused for
forty shillings, which would have prevented the damage of near forty pounds:
but I giving up in obedience to the Lord, suffered the loss thereof with joy:
so I know the Lord has not been a hard Master. Oh! what God ever preserved or
delivered in like manner, but the mighty God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; who
delivered Daniel out of the Den from the mouths of the Lions; Mordecay from
the gallows, and the three Children out of the fiery furnac^, etc. Who is my
God and the Rock of his chosen, who are faithful and true, who loves not their
lives unto death. Oh! dear child^en, hold fast your confidence with me, for I
do believe t^^t the same God which has preserved and delivered me six times
will preserve and deliver me this seventh also, and so to the end: Therefore
(as good Soldiers of Jesus Christ) let us all be valiant for truth upon Earth,
Oh! let us all buy the truth, but sell it not: although we part with our all,
that Jesus Christ may be all and in all; Oh! be faithful unto the death, then
shall you be Crowned with life: what is written is in the innocence of my Soul,
as it arose in my heart for to strengthen the weak innocent ones which may feel
me, that I speak from the experience which I had and have of the great love of
God; who is no respecter of persons, so I have nothing to boast off, for what I
have or had at any time, it was and is the free gift of God to me; for the
kingdom, power, glory, victory, triumph and pure refreshing is the Lords:
therefore let none rejoice only because the Devils are or have been subject
unto them, or that they have done or suffered much for the truth of God: but
rather that they feel Gods presence with them, and that they read their names
written in the book of life; for truly friends, if any look at the deed done as
to rest or glory in that, that mind is not like to Christ's; therefore dear
children, in all your fiery trials, look up unto the Lord, that you may (as the
three children did) know one in and amongst you who bears the form of the Son
of God, then shall you be safely preserved through the fire: but the woe will
take hold of all that are with Child or give suck to any other birth in
themselves, or others which bears not the Image and form of the Son of God,
and also to them that flee in the winter time of Gods judgments, before
judgment is brought forth unto victory: and also those who take their flight
on the sabbath day, which is the light and power of the Lord wherein all are to
rest, whereby all the people of the Lord are preserved unto Salvation: but they
that depart from the light and power where the Tree of Life is known to be food
for the Soul to feed upon, any other food will be found to be in the foolish
Virgins State, therefore what I say unto one, I say unto all, Watch, yea watch
and pray lest you enter into temptation, for the Spirit, is willing which will
help your infirmities and supply your wants: but the flesh is weak, and there
is no temptation but is common to man: therefore all to the name the Arc, for
as it was in the days of Noah, even so shall it be in this day of the coming
of the Son of Man, whose appearance is and will be in overflowing flames of
fire; as the Lords appearance was in Noah's day with overflowing floods of
water, and who shall abide his coming, who shall dwell with devouring fire, and
with everlasting burnings: none but the innocent birth whose Kingdom and
delight is not of this World nor in the honor, glory or riches thereof; but
delights in the Law of God day and night, his dwelling shall be on high, his
bread shall be sure, his water shall never fail for his defense shall be the
munition of the eternal Rock of ages, which is the power of God, the stone cut
out of the Mountain without hands which shall strike at the feet of all carved
images, imaginations and pleasant pictures, although they may appear Goldlike,
yet down must they all fall, and that shall remain only which the fire cannot
consume; therefore blessed and happy shall they be that takes the Babilonish
Child when it is young and dasheth it against that Heavenly stone, that the
Cockatrice may be crushed in the egg, that the Serpent may not be brought
forth to beguile you, as he beguiled Eve: but in the Heavenly power and Tower
all dwell, which is the place wherein the Lord will perfect his own work by the
instrument, which is his own power; so man's tool or hammer is not to be used or
heard in the Temple of God: for it is his powerful word which made all things
in the beginning, which creates anew and fastens us unto himself as a nail in a
sure place: Oh! feel it so, that you may go no more forth, then shall you be as
pillars in the house of God: even so be it, says my Soul.

Read and weigh these lines in the pure fear and dread of the Lord God, that
nothing may be taken amiss, although they be but as the Widows mite and the
overflowing of my Cup: but as the drop of a bucket in comparison of the
(...)tionable fullness which is in the infinite Lord God.

J. S.
