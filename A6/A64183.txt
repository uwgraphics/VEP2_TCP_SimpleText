Mercurius Nonsencicus.

WRITTEN FOR THE Use of the simple Understander.

By JOHN TAILOR.

Like to a whirlwind in a Tailors thimble,
Or like a gouty Tumbler, quick and nimble,
Or like Hay making in a shower of rain,
Or like a Wedding where there are not twain;
This book compared, and uncompar'd you will find,
As like as is the Water to the Wind.
Printed in the Year, 1648.

Mercurius Nonsencicus.
THis age wherein no man knows whether he lives or not lives, whether he
wakes, or dreams; when he can hardly trust his ears with what he hears,
believe his own eyes, wherewith he sees, or give credit to his own heart;
with which he pays it with thinking, Round, unsound, as rotten as a rag, with
a W for Jack-adandy.

A Plot, a Plot, a most horrible, terrible, execrable, detestable, abominable,
and damnable Plot; discovered strangely upon Newmarket Heath, where (time out
of mind) there has been a Vault with a secret unknown Trap-doore; which
door being left open (by negligence) an old blind Woman stumbled, and tumbled
into the Vault, where she saw 40000. Horse, all Manned, or backed with brave,
bold, desperate, valiant, violent, coragious Don Quixots, Lord Whachums,
Knights of the Sun, and of the Illustrious order of the burning Pestle, with
many Reformadoes, and Rodomontadoes, and others: it is a strange discovery that
a blind Woman was the first that saw it, and she presently told it to a deaf
Woman, the deaf Woman related it to a lame Woman, the lame Woman told it to a
dumb Woman, and she came post upon a lame Horse, and discovered the whole
business to me as I have related to you, what it will come to I can tell you,
nothing: old time has made more Metamorphosis lately then ever Ovid did, or
could do; time has transformed the sign of St. Martin into a Goat, and old
Charing Cross into Knive hafts, and Salt-sellers, mean Men are Men of means,
and Men of means are mean Men, without means, money, Clothes or creddit:
Bulls were wont to beget Calves, but now it is an ordinary thing for Calves to
speak Bulls, and create them by word of mouth; (as for example) Go you three
both together, and I will run before you and overtake you presently; or as a
fellow lately (well filled with drink) said that he could drink noe more then
an Apple is like an Oyster; but he could sleep like an arrow out of a Bow: and
therefore (Sir) have a care how you behave your self when you come to
present an Apple to my Lords Ape, or my Ladies Monkey, Kiss your leg and
make a hand finely; and (for all our fooling) there are many that did begin a
monstrous big huge Quarrel, that would be glad to do their best to be
quiet, and end a brabling business: twit, twat, tush, puff, mew, all are but
words to fill up a sheet in print; there is more ado with Iack-an-Apes then
with all the Bears.

This is easy stuff to be read; but it will trouble a deep understanding to
pick out the meaning; Homicide, Fratricide, Matricide, Paricide, Regicide (in
the days of King Edmund Ironside) was on the Bank side, and in Cheapside
accounted as bad as killing of folks, bless us from a mad dog, and the fall
of a Windmill: all Scots be not Knaves, nor are all English men over burdened
with honesty; for though a soft Malt makes a sweet fire, yet all is not Gold
that glisters, and there is now as much difference between Eggs and Onions as
ever there was.

When a man's Corpse and Capacity are both gross, it is sign that his Body and
his understanding are Twinns; for though it be a cruel torment for a wise man
to be bound in a Chair whilst a fool talks him to death, yet I conclude him
to be none of the wisest that is overmuch taken in love with any thing that is
written in this Pamphlet, neither has he any other then a Tiffany patience
that is very angry at the writer that cares not for it; truth does seldom go
without a scratcht face; and though Mellancholicus and Pragmaticus do play O
Man in desperation, and write odly, madly, yet I am so tame a fool that I do
dare neither to write Knavishly, or speak wisely; though (perhaps) I do now
and then show my valor in thinking truly.

The pestilent penns of pestiferous Pragmaticall, Aquaticall poetasters has
sweat out whole Reames to small purpose; they have transformed, and
metamorphosed Mercury into more shapes then ever Proteus had: most curiously
curious Mercurius has been sublimated like a Neapolitan Unguent or Unction
with a pretense to cure the Kingdom of the Morbus Gallicus, Arbitrary tyranny;
but all those nimble feather braind, froath witted Mercuriallists have done no
better then played the Iuggling Alchymists; or like an Imposture Quacksalver
has turned all our money into Quicksilver, with hei presto it is gone: (to the
Devil I think) my self, with some hundreds of the Kings Servants, are in the
happy condition of Poets, poor and pennylesse, our Purses being turned
Brownists, not enduring a cross to come neer'em; but the most of us are
practiced in the Carthusian order, abstinence or fasting ( Nolens volens) so
that whereas in the days of Yore, Diebus illis, Halcion times, some gross
witted sonns of ignorance would call us his Majesty's Biefe-eaters, or the
Kings Cormorants, and other pretty foolish Apellations, and Epethites; so that
if any of us ever were Cormorants, I am sure that most of us are transformed
into Camelions, Air, Smoke, Vapors, words and wind, being our delicate
dainty first and second courses; yet (by supernall favor and providence) we
hold up our heads, stand on our feet, look cheerfully, and talk as heartily
as some that fare deliciously: we have seen some high floods, and low ebbs,
and that part or spoake in Times wheel that is lowest may be raised; in the
mean space we will feed upon hope till we can get better Victuals.

Greedy Gatherers of too much Mammon, will (one day) find it like the
gathering of so much Manna, it will turn to worms, and gnaw the Consciences
of the avaricious possessors; great faults are commonly Gentlemen-ushers to
great punishmens, one draws the other after, and as the Thread follows the
Needle, even so proditorious, perfidious, and presumptuous actions are dogged by
self guiltines, and doomed by divine vengance to unavoyded destruction.

There is a new trade lately practiced in England, which is to cut throats, and
kill men for 3. or 4.s. a week, they say the Devil himself is Master of the
Company: the most part, or greatest numbers of this society are so far from the
way of Peace, that they hate the peace of their Country: they have banished
the Peace of Conscience, the Kings peace (I am sure) they have broken, and the
peace of God, they (through want of understanding) have no stomach to.

In the Introduction to Grammar (Vulgarly called the Accidence) there is the
Common of 2, and the Common of 3; but right and true bred English men have
been Gramarians in more Commons then 2 or 3: we had a House of Commons
Renouned, Religious, Venerable, and honorable, and should be in that reverend
regard, that detraction (or distraction) should not so much as snarle, or
grumble against: we see now that honorable House daily abused, traduced, and
exposed to the most and worst of what transcendent defamatory tongues, or
pens can (out of grief of heart) inveterate malice, spleenative envy, or
the gall of Bitterness, speak, write, invent or publish.

The Common Wealth is not common, but private, and so private that a few have
got all, many have lost all, and the greatest number have never a whit;
insomuch that the Common wealth is not the wealth that is common, the want of
which has made me and many thousands to be much troubled with the Kings Evil.

The Common prayer was esteemed a good Director (or Direction) but now it is
contradicted by another Antidirectory, much better then the old one, as some
wise men say.

The Common Purse is empty, the Common Treasure is invisible; the Common
Counsel are Grave, and wise, and would have all well: there are some good men
wanting who should hasten the effecting of the Common safety; but there is
here, there (but not every where) a Common Whore that lies like damnable
stumbling blocks, that the Common ways are filthy, uneven, unmended, and
irreparable, whilst our Common misery is continually increased, repaired,
enlarged, extended, and amplified.

There are also half a dozen of Cases as ablative, genitive, vocative,
accusative, nominative; Reader I request, will, and require you to bear with
my misplacing of the cases, I pray you consider that all things are out of
order, great men and small men, low men and tall men, be it known unto all men
that there is a bad Case, a good Case, a base Case, a mean Case, a Trebble
Case, a desperate Case, a mad Case, a sad Case, a woeful Case, a wretched
Case, a fine Case, and a poor Case, hey all six and six.

But hold, hold, wit whither will thou, take heed (old Jack Tailor) keep thy
first principles, stand to thy promise, beware of writing a wise word, it, and,
of, for, by, from, to, at, wherefore, it is no matter when, or why, make an end
to no end, and as thy Title was intrincicall, so let thy Epilogue, and
Catastrophe be nonsencicall in heroic, duncicall, and natural, artificial
Verses, beyond the understanding of all the Colleges, or Universities of
either Kent or Christendom, Christian or Shropshire man, and let the world
know, that by the rules of Gallen, Hippocrates, Avicen, Paracelsus, or
Esculapius himself, the running gout will never make a good footman.

Like to the embrodered Meadows of the Moon,
Or like the houres' twixt six and seven at Noone,
Or like a Cock that wants Stones, Spurs, and Comb,
Or like a Traveller that is never from home,
Or like Tobacco that wants stink or smoke,
Or like the Devil in Religious Cloak;
Such is this Pamphlet, writ with such advisement,
As troubles not the State, or what the Wise meant.
FINIS.
