A TESTIMONY for God's Everlasting Truth, As it has been learned of and in
JESUS;

Testifying against such as through unbelief have departed from, or been
disobedient to the Spirit that convinces the World of Sin:

Among whom R. C. has appeared with his many things, to oppose and withstand
the one thing, the Spirit of Life, that sets free from Sin and Death, which is
the Truth which the People called Quakers have and do testify to and of.

R. T.

They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us,
they would no doubt have continued with us; but they went out, that they might
be made manifest, that they were not of us, 1 John 2. 19.

But ye have an Unction from the holy One, and ye know all things, V. 20.

This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you,
that God is Light, and in him is no Darkness at all, 1 John 1. 5.

Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common Salvation,
it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you, that ye should
earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered to the Saints, Jude
ver. 3.

Printed in the Year, 1669.

THese following Lines are to such as have, or may meet with R. C's Writing,
Entitled, God's Truth attested according to Scripture; and I reading it over,
and finding it not only contrary to Scripture, but in darkness opposing and
contradicting the Light and Spirit that gave forth the Scriptures; exalted and
exalting his own image over and against the express Image of the Everlasting
God, I could not but in answer thereto give unto you what I have received of
the Fountain of Life; which all that make opposition against the Light and
Spirit which is Everlasting, are out from, and know neither the Soul that God
takes pleasure ^s, nor the Salvation thereof, but remains in darkness, and
under the power of Death, not knowing the Gift of God which is Eternal Life;
but to so many as believe in him [the Light of the World] he gives power to be
the Sons of God, Heirs with him, yea Coheirs of the Inheritance of Light and
Glory.

So to all mankind, I and all that partake of the common salvation (that has
appeared unto all, for deliverance from death, and Deaths power, again to
recover into the good state that was before transgression entered, or the Night
of Apostasy over spread the Earth; for Light was in the beginning, and indeed
the beginning of all, and shall abide when all imaginations shall cease;) and
by Faith therein have obtained Life, have good will unto every one, traveling
therein to bring others thereto, and to preserve out of the many snares which
the evil One has and does lay to deceive; but the increase of Light, and the
dominion thereof must never have end, and the enlargment and growth hereof has
and does inrage the whole World that love Darkness better then Light; so they
have bent their Bows, and prepared their Arrows, and their tongues are become
as a two-edged Sword, to wound the Innocent, for the poison of Asps is under
that which speaks dispitefully against the Spirit of Grace; for no other have
the Children of Light testified of, or believed in, but the Spirit of Jesus,
which they that do and have erred from are devising against, and so cry up the
greatness of their own Diana, to turn aside or draw out of the way of peace;
but he has, and will rebuke them, yea in his hot displeasure, who either rage
or imagine vain things against his Christ, which he will exalt above all the
Mountains: and such is my love, and the love of all that in the love of the
Father live, that we desire none might perish, but have Life Everlasting, which
the Father gives freely unto all, without respect of persons, that in his
Light believe and walk, to receive Salvation thereby; and so this is testified
of, and spoke to in all, that all that come to the Faith of it, may with us
witness it saves from sin; and his Name was and is called Jesus, but all out of
the Faith discern it not; how should they, being carnally minded? though it
sometimes prick them, they kick against it, and to pervert from it lay
stumblings in the way, and bring forth their carnal imagination of God and
Christ, and of his Person and Flesh, which was never learned, but in that they
resist; for darkness cannot comprehend Light, but in the Light is Life and
Salvation; and this they have, and do bear testimony of, who have learned the
Truth, as it is in Christ Jesus; and for the Truth sake which must prevail over
all the Opposers thereof, and for your Souls sake this is written, that no
simple ones may be turned out of the way, nor stumble or fall, but come to
believe in the Light, and the redemption thereof they will come to be partakers
of, and there is no other that can work the work of God, to free from evil and
error, but the Christ of God, the express Image of the Father, only learned in
the Spirit and Light that comes or proceeds from the Father and Son, and the
obedient and faithful thereto have been, and are led out of the World where Sin
and Error are, to the victory ^ver it, and such will not believe only from what
we declare of it, though it be true, but finding this heavenly Treasure in
themselves, and the freedom thereby attained, shall confess this is the Son of
God that makes free indeed; and I know they who are not captivated under the
power of Sin and Darkness, nor lovers of themselves more then of God, will feel
that in the Love of the Father to the Souls of all this is written.

R. T.

A TESTIMONY for God's Everlasting TRUTH, etc.
THe Light which I with many thousands have believed in, and found, saves from
sin, and none in the Faith of God, are at a question what it is, but know it is
of the Father, bringing to the Life, Christ Jesus, whose first appearance was
and ever is to condemn sin in the flesh; and being believed in, quickneth in
Spirit, by which only the Son of God was and is revealed; and all that have
gone another way to know the Father or the Son, but in the Spirit of Jesus, are
vain Image-makers, Robbers, and Thieves, leaving the Door, to clime another
way; So none comes unto me but whom the Father draws, and by the Spirit only
is the drawing, says Christ, which is Life and Salvation, witnessed by all
that have Faith therein, and this is that which, according to his faithfulness
that has promised, is and must be exalted over all, that in darkness have and
do invent against the Light; amongst which R. C. will be found a worker, to
whom I have this to say, that if they were and are accursed that come not forth
to help the Lord against the mighty; What shall become of thee, and such as
have helped the mighty in force and falsehood against the Lord? who will bring
to pass (as he has spoken) Light and Salvation to the ends of the Earth; and
all that contend against it shall fall before it, and thou as one strong to
deceive; and therefore would color thy work with that which testifies
against thee; Saying, in thy title, thou will attest according to Scripture,
and so beginst with a lie, for thou detests both Scripture and the words of
Christ therein; for thou deniest his Doctrine, and call it a new opinion to
preach the Light up for Christ; though Christ says, I am the Light of the
World; how has Satan deceived thee, that thou should think any should
receive thy fallasies, that callst the Doctrine which Christ and the Apostles
taught fallasies? shall thou or the Apostle John be believed? he says, In the
beginnining was the Word, and the Word was God, and by him But he in his
Queries denies Christ to make all things; so we marvel not that he should deny
our Doctrine, that denies Christ and his Apostles.
all things were made, and in him was Life, and the Life were the Light of men,
and this is the true Light that enlighteneth every man, and thou lightly and
slightly says; this of the first of John is their ground, and so resists the
Scripture, and yet says thou will attest according to Scripture, and then
speaks of the Humanity in conjunction with the Deity; so far art thou from
attesting according to Scripture, that the words thou usest I never read in
Scripture, but know, they with other words used by thee, have not a ground from
the Scriptures, (as thou confessest the Preachers of the Light have) but from
the Antichristian Spirit, that having despised the Light, and offered despite
unto the Spirit of Grace, cannot express their matters and inventions in the
Language of the Spirit, by which the Scriptures were given forth, except they
steal them where they are already written; and so have joined words in the
dark, where all images are framed; and amongst these thou have got some to
strengthen thee against the Light, and to lay falsehood on the obeyers thereof,
in saying, they deny the bodily Humanity of our Lord; who is thy lord, indeed
is to be denied; but the Lord from Heaven by whom all things were made, thou
never heardst any to deny, that have faith in the Light; or any of those names
which the Scripture gives, as the man Christ Jesus, as he that became flesh and
lived amongst us; and that was, and is a great Mystery, God manifested in
flesh, the Christ indeed, appointed of God, to be both Priest and King; and for
thy attesting according to Scripture, is only a relating what thou have read;
which Pope and Prelate as well as thee can talk of the Virgins conceiving,
bringing forth, and of Christ's Suffering, Death, and Resurrection and
Ascension, and none of those things there written did thou ever hear denied
by any of the Children of Light: But the imaginations of others, and thee
thereon, were and are to be testified against; for it was vain imaginations
that the Lord did and does complain on; and however thou came to be in
Prison, and elsewhere with the people of the Lord; yet it was then seen and in
that which discerns, that the chamber of imagery was never destroyed in thee,
nor the old bottle broken, but the ground standing in thee that brings forth
Briers and Thorns, and is near unto cursing and the fruits thereof thou have
brought forth, in perverting some, and laying stumblings in the way of the
simple; thou were a climer at the first, and got some words of the fame of
Life, but was and art in Death, and to this day bring forth therein; and so
being in blindness thy self, think others cannot see; and so after thy
relating part of what is written, concerning Christ Jesus, we see, say thou,
what Testimony the Scriptures gives of the Lord's Christ, that he is not the
Light in any man's Conscience, nor the Principle of Light: art thou not ashamed
to call to see that which cannot be seen? for does the Scriptures any where say
Christ is not the Light in the Conscience, nor the Principle of Light? so, see
thy work is to deceive, and make people believe lies; whose work art thou a
doing, that art drawing from believing in the Light, to believe a lie? does not
the Scriptures by the mouth of Christ say, believe in the Light? and do the
Scriptures hold out any Faith, or any to believe in, but Christ? and is not the
cause and being of all things Christ? and yet thou deniest him to be the
principle of Light; what would thy dark mind make the principle of Light, that
denies the Lord Christ, that says, I am the Light of the World? thou show
thy ignorance of the mystery of Faith which in the pure Conscience is hid; but
whose Conscience is defiled, and feared, has no feeling of Light nor Faith,
and so would blind the eyes of others, to lead captive as the Divil does all
that disobey the Light; for it is an everlasting Truth, who resist the Light,
that gave forth the Scriptures, does pervert the Scriptures to their own
destruction, not knowing the Interpreter of a Thousand, for in the motion of
Light and Spirit were the Scriptures given forth, and by the same only is the
Holy men gave them forth as they were moved of the Holy Ghost, 2 Pet. 1. 21.
true understanding thereof, and those that have, and do bring forth, without
being learned of the Light, have filled the World with Errors and Falsehoods;
Babel indeed, and thou a chief Builder therein, ignorant of the Covenant of
Light, Christ the Covenant to Gods people, and a Light unto the Gentiles to the
ends of the Earth; thus says As the Prophet Isaiah and old Simeon declared.
the Scripture, with much more in Testimony to and for the Truth, he is the
Light of the World; and so all that have an eye to see may see, that thou go
about to attest a Lie, and the Scriptures testify against thee, and are
contrary to thy Doctrine, that denyest the Christ of God; who art framing an
Image; but thy Snare is broken, and all that love and obey the Light, have and
shall escape, and thy own work shall turn upon thee; for he that commanded
Light to shine out of Darkness, has shined into our hearts, to give us the
knowledge of himself, in the face of Jesus Christ; but who resists the shining
in their own hearts, wax worse and worse until they come to war against that,
to which those sent of God turned men to, from Darkness to Light, from the
Power of Satan unto the Power of God; but who sent thee, that turns from the
Power of Light, to believe thy dark Imaginations, of a creaturely Soul? and
instead of bringing Scripture for thy Proof, thou bring a Proof from
Beamond, or thy own Imaginations, that we should have found our souls
creaturely from the flames of the Righteous burnings of Gods Wrath in our souls
for sin; Oh, thick Darkness! is this thy Argument to prove the Soul creaturely,
that it can live with everlasting burnings; the least child of Light could give
thee a clearer knowledge of the Soul, then thee, or thy Teacher J. B. ever
attained to; but who hates the Light is, and must be bound in Chains of
Darkness for evermore, and there I leave thee, in that matter as concerning the
Soul, and return to thy opinion of the Light: thou say in thy fourth page,
Christ is not the Principle of Light, and in the sixth page thou say, the
Light in the Conscience which these new Preachers cry up for Christ, is but the
Principle of Christ, which is his own Habitation: This is such Logic as the
Framers of Babel use to Build with; vain Philosophy indeed, from which all that
believe in the Light know redemption; how different is thy Way and Doctrine
from the Way of the Lord, where the wafering man, though a fool, errs not;
wherein the simple may walk and be safe; but what profit is there of thy
winding and turning Christ not the principle of Light, yet Light the principle
of Christ? what serves thy opinion and Doctrine for? but to lay stumblings in
the way of the simple, and instead of appearing wiser then others, thou have
bewrayed thy ignorance in this thy work, and former practices, in perverting
from the good Way of the Lord, not knowing what thou say nor whereof thou
affirmest; have thou not yet learned what the word Principle is? is it not the
beginning? is not Christ the beginning of all things? Thou in thy Queries
say, all was not made by Christ, contrary to Light or to Scripture.
by him, and for him was all made; and yet will thou deny him to be the
beginning, or Principle of Light, as in thy fourth page, and in thy sixth page
thou say, Light is but the Principle of Christ, so whilst in thy Dark mind,
thou would debase the Light in the conscience, see how thou have lifted it
up; for instead of saying the Light comes from Christ, thou hold out the
Light to be the beginning of Christ; for does not every rational Creature know
the principle of any thing is before that which comes of it? the Principle of
Christ say thou? which is his own Habitation: so thou confessest the Light
in the Conscience to be the dwelling place of God, and yet would cry out
against such as preach the Light in the conscience; thou do indeed darken
knowledge by words without understanding; for never any that despised the Light
knew him that is the Light of the World, or his Dwelling place: thou have
devised against that which is too hard for thee; may all the Enemies of the
Light be covered with confusion, as thou art; then thou go on (in the same
page 6.) again to make a relation of his Death, Resurection and Ascension, and
so saying no more, nor so much in that matter then formerly I have taught a
Child or Children of 7 years old to say; and here say thou, that Opinion is
condemned by the Scriptures that denies the Ascension of the Lords Person; who
they be that deny the ascension of the Lords Christ I know not; for all that
have Faith in the Light bare testimony thereto; but for the word person, is it
any where written in Scripture his Person Ascended? how dare thou add to the
words? and thou farther say, that our Foundation is built upon the ground of
Nature: if thou had said our Foundation is the ground, or cause, or being of
all natural things, thou had spoke true, though thou know it not, for by
him that is our Foundation all things were made* and without it was nothing
made that was made, John 1. 2. and this is the true Light that enlightens every
man that comes into the World; and the Children of Light never denied his
Person, that took upon him the Seed of Abraham, became flesh, and lived amongst
us: so instead of proving the Children of Light in error, thou have proved thy
self an Accuser, and the Scripture has and does testify against thee, for us,
that have not, nor do not declare of any other Christ, but he of whom the
Scriptures declare to be the Light of the World: and so thou go on to repeat
many good words in the relation of some thing written in the Scriptures, and
adds thy own words, that the everlasting Gospel is his Death, Burial and
Resurrection, as the Scriptures declare, (say thou) and notes a Scripture to
prove it, that is not to be found in all the Bible 1 Cor. 25. 1. is this to
attest by Scripture to direct to that which was never there? but the Apostle
Paul says, the Gospel is the Power of God unto Salvation, and that the Word in
the heart, and in the mouth, was the Gospel he preached, and the everlasting
Gospel proclaimed by an Angel through Heaven was, fear God and give Glory to
him, for the hour of his Righteous Judgments is come; these did not say
Christ's Death and Burial were the Gospel, but who are Witnesses of his
Resurrection do know the Gospel; but the Opposers of the Light in Conscience
see it not* But to take farther notice of thy unlearned words, the rest of thy
7th page is filled with such words as thou have either borrowed or rather
stolen because thou namest not the Author, from Beamon, or it may be some of
John Jacksons, for he once brought out such a work of Darkness as thine is, and
thou have the same words, so the answer given him may come over this part of
thy work; for Truth must forever be over the head of Falsehood: and thou that
say thou would attest thy truth according to Scripture, thou drawest a
conclusion from thy own, and thy borrowed words, without any Scripture; and
now, say thou, that it is manifest from hence that this Light that does
condemn the Heathen's, is not the Lord Christ that does justify; but shows
neither good reason nor Scripture for it; but makes mention of Paul to the
Romans, which words being taken as they were given forth by the Apostle proves
thy affirmation false, for the Apostles words are these, speaking to the Romans
or Heathens, Romans 1. 19. The wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all
ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the Truth in unrighteousness,
because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God has showed
it unto them: now without R. C. can make any so blind as himself, will Paul's
words here, or any where, prove that he which Condemns is not Christ that
Justifies? and farther, would not these words prove against thee that brings
the proof that the Truth is held in unrighteousness by the Heathens? for is not
Christ the Truth? but who knows not Christ to be the Light, knows him not to be
the Truth, and so builds on a lie, and makes lies the defense thereof; but who
have faith in the Light, by which the Scriptures were given forth, believe
them, and to them they witness, that into Christ's Hands all Judgment is given,
and he was made manifest to destroy the works of the Devil; does not he Condemn
that which he Destroys? and have thou not read that his first Appearance was
and is to Condemn sin in the flesh? thus say the Scriptures; but thou say he
is not the Justifier that condemns; so the Scriptures say, Christ condemns, and
whom he justifies none can condemn; but thou would have another to justify
then the Christ of God, into whose hands God has committed all Judgment; but,
say thou, the Romans had this Light, though they were Heathens; yea, they
had, and did thou know and believe the Scriptures, would thou thus write,
and say, thou would attest by Scripture, and write contrary to it? Is not the
Promise and Covenant of the Father, Christ? and did not Prophets and Apostles
testify of him? and say not the Scriptures, I will give him for a Covenant to
my People, and a Light unto the Gentiles? the same that was the Covenant to
them that believe the same, was a Light to the Heathens, as say the Prophets;
not two, but one: and as says Christ, The Comforter shall come, and this shall
condemn the World of sin: And so, is it not plain that he that condemns the
Sinner comforts the Saints? and that is the Justifier; him that Christ says
should convince and reprove the World of Sin, of Righteousness, and of
Judgment, was and is Comforter and Justifier, For we are justified in Spirit,
as says the Apostle, and by this only come to know the Father and Son in the
Spirit and Light, and desire no more to know him after the Flesh, as says the
Apostle; but thou bring a Doctrine contrary to Christ, Prophets, and
Apostles: for, say thou, the Apostles came not to turn them to that Light
that accuses or excuses them, as their Savior; but preached Christ Jesus at
Jerusalem: be ashamed to affirm falsehood; did not the Apostle say, he was sent
to turn from Darkness to Light^? and did they ever preach two Lights, as thou
would do? but gave all to understand, that that which did accuse was that
which did excuse, and that the Grace which brought Salvation had appeared unto
all men, and taught them that believed therein, to deny all ungodliness, and to
this he committed all, to the Word of Grace, that was able to save their Souls;
telling them, he was an able Minister of the Spirit, and not of the Letter; and
did not run over the History of Christ's Conception, Birth, Death and
Resurrection in words, as thou do, but turned them to that Light and Spirit
whereby they had learned him; though his outward appearance at Jerusalem he
never saw, nor desired any more to know after the Flesh; but pressed all to
obedience of that Grace and Light that he had found the sufficiency of;
declaring the Son of God was revealed in him; and his travel was, that Christ
might be formed in them, to whom he was sent preaching to them, That a measure
of the Spirit was given to every one to profit withal: so let all that have an
eye see whether the Scriptures of Truth give testimony to thy Doctrine, that
would prove them in Error that cry up the Light for Salvation; or thy Doctrine,
that says, Christ is not the Light in every man's Conscience, nor yet the
Principle of Light; the wise in heart can judge: And then go on, and say,
The Light in the Conscience is but the Law: it is the Law indeed, that if thou
had not thrown behind thy back, thou might have come to have known the new
Covenant [Christ] which God promised in the last days to write in the heart;
and this did and does make perfect, teaching, and bringing, or binding to God,
that they shall not depart from him: and he that abides with him, not
departing from him, is perfect in him, and by him in the Law of the Spirit of
Grace, that sets free from Sin and Death. But of this Law thou art not learned,
nor of him that was made under the Law, that art using the Apostles words
spoken of the Law in the Letter, to oppose the Law of the Spirit: but who are
come to the Law of the Spirit, know freedom, and that he is Christ that sets
free; and such thou shall never turn backward, who by believing in the Light
have found Salvation, and know, that he which saves is Jesus, and by his Power
has freedom in Righteousness from all that has or would oppress the holy Seed:
and this is the Son that has set free, even the Christ of God. And thy tongue
confesses, that the Believers in the Light, and they only have attained freedom
indeed, and cannot be entangled with the cunning deceits of men. And for these
thy following words (page 8.) now that Christ is Light, who is he that denies;
but that Christ is the Light of Conscience, who is he that will not deny,
(say thou.) Indeed R. thou do in this manifest what thou art a battering
and breaking, thy own works, for Truth is out of thy reach: for did thou ever
all thy time thou were in Prison, or elsewhere with us, ever hear any preach
up, (or write) the Light of Conscience? It seems thou are both deaf and blind,
and so art to remain till by obedience to the Light (thou invents against) thou
come to be for the Light that we believe, testify of, and call to, is
Everlasting, and none in thy comprehending nature knows the power and glory
thereof: and so such as thou have thou bringst forth; and having a Lump of thy
own framing, a formed light, created light, or light of a Conscience that may
be defiled, and sets this up, would make people believe thy image were our
God: and so falls a beating thy own image, crying, who will not deny. I answer,
all who believe in that true Light deny all and every of thy imaginations, to
be Christ; and from the knowledge of the true Christ, are all Image-makers shut
out.

Yet another Christ then he that dyed at Jerusalem did thou never hear the
Children of Light declare, or testify of o^ to, and he is not divided, he and
his Light is one: and thou confessest he is a Light, and yet not in the
Conscience.

But Darkness cannot comprehend Light; and as for the remainer of thy eighth
page, and the greatest part of thy nineth page, being but a repetition of some
of J. B's dark sayings, or writings of that History of Scripture, formerly
being taken notice of; with some like Logic, as thou have before mentioned I
shall pass; but in the latter end of thy 9th page, thou thus concluds; now
having this Demonstration from Scripture of the ascension of the body of our
Lord Jesus; and this (thou say) may judge them that would have Christ all
Spirit and no Body: To this I cannot but answer, who they are that deny
Christ's Body or Ascension, (as in Scripture it is declared) I know not; for
all that confess to the Light in Conscience testify thereto; but thou may
well mistake others Doctrine that so forgets thy own! as to say, now having
this demonstrated from Scripture of the Ascension of the Body of our Lord, when
there is not a word brought by thee (in a page or two before) of Scripture to
prove it; but that he Ascended into Glory, and we in the Faith know it; but for
thy so stoutly affirming by Scriptures, that thou have no Scripture for, it
will appear unto all that have an eye to see but as Sorcery; even as Jannes and
Jambres withstood Moses, so thou withstands the Truth: and those who through
negligence to attend, or disobedience to the Light have been overtaken with the
Night, have or may stumble at thy work of Darkness: yet who have learned of the
Light, the Truth, as it is in Jesus, thou can not turn aside: For what manner
of blind stuff do thou bring forth, as though thou would make people
believe thou have Scripture, against those that confess to the Light in
Conscience, but can bring none against them, and so brings for them; and
confesses the birth of their opinion is from the first of John: so thou
confessest they to whom thou opposest have Scripture to prove; but thou art so
far from having any to prove thy words and imaginations, that thou would if
thou knew'st how deny the Scripture, that thou might hide Light and Truth,
by thy imaginations, thou sets up a fiction, and accuses us of it; for say
thou, where it is said of Christ, not of Light of Conscience: I would thou were
so honest as to speak true words, and then thou would confess, that though
for years thou have watched for evil against us, thou never heardst any amongst
the Children of Light, but declare, what is spoken in the first of John was
spoke of Christ, and that by his own Light and Spirit was he to be learned, as
says the Scripture, A man sent of God to bear Testimony to the Light; did he
bear Testimony to an other then Christ? no, all that have been, or are sent of
him testify of the Light; but they that run and are not sent, strive against
it, as thou do, and bring the Scripture that says, the Life of Christ is
the Light of men, and be it is that inlightneth every man that comes into the
World; and that the Scriptures are true, none contends with us about that; but
that we understand not our own Doctrine, and thence set up a fiction of our own
invention: do thou think thy denying to contend with us about the
Scriptures, when all that can see do see thou do contend, will make any
believe thy accusation that we do not understand our own Doctrine, and so set
up a fiction? why have not thou with thy great understanding, that seems so
wise in thy own eyes, as to gainsay the Truth that is received and believed by
thousands, come forth, and tell where this Light testified of by the Apostle
is, if not in the Conscience? for thy fancy is contrary to the Apostle, that
appealed to that of God in every man's Conscience, and to that was manifest: but
where the conscience is seared, they see not, nor feel not, and being out of
the Truth, which is now where to be found, but where God requires it, in the
inner parts; and who are gone out to seek it abroad, whatever they may think of
their own Doctrines, know nothing of the Truth; but are found contenders
against it, and against the Scriptures; which testify of him that is the
Christ of God, to be in the Heart and in the Mouth; that he dwells in Light; and
thou have confessed in thy words, though in darkness, not knowing what thou
say: that in Conscience is Gods Habitation; yet art contending that any
should preach Christ the Light in the Conscience; is he not in his dwelling
place,? does not the Scripture say, God dwells in Light, and that God is in
Christ, and that he will gather all things unto him? and is not Christ the
Rest, into which all that the Father has given him must be gathered into him
and be in him? as says Christ, I in them, and thou in me: So thou have proved
Christ the Light in the Conscience, when thou go about to disprove it,
confessing the Light in the Conscience the Principle of Christ, and his own
Habitation, and they his whom the Father gives him: and Christ said, I in them,
so the Scriptures prove, that according to Scripture thou attest not, but
contrary thereto, that say, God has made a formed Light for a Habitation of
man's Rest, Page 7. What new opinion art thou a crying up, that art setting up
another rest for Gods people then Christ? what would thou have them rest in?
a formed Light (say thou) God is Light says the Scripture, but no where
that he was formed that gave form and being to all: and another Light then that
which gives Salvation did not the people of God ever seek, or find to be a
Rest, but he that saves from sin, and his Name is Jesus, and in him thousands
are come to know sure Salvation by the Light made manifest in Conscience, and
are kept thereby, that they could no more believe thy formed light, nor
Doctrine thereof, then in the Papists Eucharist, which indeed are both Idols,
formed in one ground, and the Scripture plentifully testifies against you both;
yet the Papist in their carnal understanding have a Scripture for their Idols;
but where can thou get any word to make a cover for thy Image; that say, I
give you to know, that the Light in Conscience is but the spirit of the humane
Soul, and is creaturely? what Scripture have thou for the ground of thy
Opinion? So all that love the Light see thy ground is not from Scripture; there
not being a word from the first of Genesis, to the last of the Revelation for
this thy new Doctrines, for a formed light, made into a habitation for man's
Rest, and the Light of the Conscience, but the spirit of the humane nature: And
so thou that in thy Title say, thou would attest by Scripture, art
teaching new Doctrine, that thou have no word in the Scripture for.

But to proceed, in page 10. thou say, our Doctrine is this, That which
makes manifest is Light, and the Light is Christ: and have not thou in these
words manifested thy self to be a Contender against Scripture, as well as
against us that in the Spirit that gave forth the Scripture witness; and
therefore to us does it witness: for are not those very words (as thou say
we say) the words of the Apostle, that it is Light that manifests? so says
Christ, I am the Light: so thou contends with the People of the Lord, for
saying as the Apostle and Christ says. Then thou go on to ask three
Questions: First, Was the Light in man's Conscience that personal appearance
that John bore witness to. (Second, Was the Light in man's Conscience that word
of God that was God, by which all things were made that were made.) Third, Was
the Light in Conscience personally, to be seen by the firmental eye, to be felt
with the outward hand. And from these thy own words, thou drawest a conclusion,
that if the Light of Conscience be not to be understood in these capcities, our
Doctrine is false: Though thou have brought no more reason to prove it. then if
thou had said, I would have it so; for as to the Apostles words we testify,
and have learned in that Spirit, which the carnal man could never discern, nor
the things thereof; but the Apostle answers himself, and has declared, of whom
he testified, by whom all things were made; and that this was the true Light,
that enlightneth every man that comes into the World; and it was the Christ of
God which he bore Testimony to; so instead of proving us (...) error that
confess Christ the Light in every Conscience, thou bringst thy self under the
Plagues threatened for adding to the Scriptures: For where did ever the Apostle,
in that place, or any other, speak of personal and firmental, as thou do, and
conclude all false that are not of thy mind? And to answer thee further, the
Apostle did preach and testify of Christ, and as he taught him, so is he
learned in Light or Spirit; is not this in the Conscience? How would thou
have Christ seen, felt and handled? how is Christ with his people to the end of
the World, according to his Promise? and how is he in them that was with them?
Is it to be seen firmental, as thou call? though no other did the Apostle
testify of, then he that became flesh, and dwelt amongst us: yet no more did
they know him after the Flesh, but after the Spirit: but thou, and such as
thou, who in your carnal minds would comprehend spiritual things, bring forth
your carnal apprehensions, and having no knowledge but what you have sensually,
know neither Christ's Flesh nor glorious Body, but that which could be pierced,
wounded and crucified, all Image-makers are still oppressing; for he is still
slain in spiritual Egypt where thou art: and though thou know, we, that thou
seem to strike at, did and do confess to him, and no other, that made a good
confession before Pilate, of whom John bear witness to be the Light of the
World; and this is true, and they are found Liars before God, that would set up
any thing to be believed in, but he that in Spirit is revealed* for thousands
of those that saw his personal appearance at Jerusalem knew him not to be the
Christ; nay, by Spirit then was he to be learned, as thou may read, where Peter
confesses him; and Christ says, Flesh and Blood has not revealed this to
thee, but the Spirit of my Father, and against this art thou fighting, and
those that are lead thereby, for by Light and Spirit have we learned Christ,
and so teach him; and this is he which is testified of, that is the Eternal
Gift of God, and he that is sent of God, whom to know is Eternal Life; but of
this are they all ignorant that call the Light in Conscience a formed thing,
and the Spirit of the humane earthly Soul, but their ignorance of the great
Power of God is not to be marvelled at, that says, The Light and Spirit is of
the humane earthly soul; and so would make all believe, that the souls of men
and women were no other then the Dogs, or Cats, and Beasts that must perish,
for what is of the Farth must to the Earth: have thou not read, God breathed
into man, and he became a living Soul? and thou call this Human or Earthly;
needs then must they stumble and fall, that walk in the dark, as thou* and all
do that would comprehend the Light to dispute against; but over thee, and all
vain Image-makers it shall rise, that with your dark Images and inventions have
filled the World with Idolatry, Profainness and Athism; and what doctrine more
then thine does it? that preachest the Soul Human and Creaturely and the Light
formed of it; so neither Soul nor Light Immortal and Eternal, but of the Earth;
a beastly doctrine, which has manifested the Teacher to know nothing but what
he knows sensually: yet thou go on repeating what Christ did and suffered,
when manifest at Jerusalem, and then say, this manifests Christ is
Formative, and not a Defusive Principle; this, like thy former stuff, which
thou have got in thy dark mind, and so in dark words expressest it; what manner
of Christ thou would have people believe in, all in the Light see; but the
Christ of God is he that fills all things, as the Scriptures testify: And
then thou go on to confess, that the Light of conscience was in the
Apostles, and by this Peter confessed Christ to be the Son of God: How has
Satan blinded thee, that loves darkness better then Light! that thou should
bring this Scripture, that call the Light the Spirit of the human Soul; and
Christ says the Spirit of the Father revealed it in Peter: and was not, and is
not Christ in the Father? so whatever thou have denied, thou have now proved
Father, Spirit and Son the Light in the Conscience; for they were never
divided: or else thou must hold after thy former dark doctrine, the Father and
the Spirit are but the Spirit of the human Soul: thus shall all they be snared
that invent against the Truth, which is the same yesterday to day and for ever;
and let them all be so confounded, as thou art, that devise against the Light,
says my soul; for thou say, Peter by his Light in Conscience bares witness
to Christ the Son of God; and Christ says, not Flesh and blood, but the Spirit
of my Father revealed it; and know thou not that God is one, not divided? I
in the Father, and the Father in me, says Christ; and none ascends to Heaven,
but he that comes down from Heaven, the Son of man in Heaven; but this thou,
nor any that says the Light is the spirit of the humane soul, could ever see;
but who in the Light and Spirit learn him, know he fills all things, even the
same to whom Peter confessed blessed for ever; as says the Apostle, One God and
Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all, Ephesians. 4. 6.
and this is he we testify of, that dwells in the Light in Conscience, where
thou confessest the Son of God is revealed; and yet say the Light in
Conscience is not Christ; for he says, he is ascended far above all Heavens,
that he may fill all things; and then go on, saying, Now, O man, open thy
eyes, and see how dangerously thou stand, that denies the Body of our Lord
Jesus Christ in his Person. And to this I answer, none that discerns it can or
does deny it, and their eyes are open to see thy confusion, that would prove
that the Light in Conscience is not Christ, by bringing this proof that he
ascended that he might fill all things; O gross darkness! Does he fill all
things, yet not the Conscience? or have thou so long strove against the Light
in Conscience, that thou accountest Conscience nothing? for if any thing, then
thou provest he is in it; for he fills all things: and does he fill with
darkness, or with Light? for thy following words in the latter end of thy 11th
page, are a false Accusation, in saying, We make that Body that did the Fathers
Will, by whom we are saved, to be extinguished, and as to any Substance
vanished away as smoke. To this I answer, I never knew any that had faith in
the Light (against which thou have been devising) deny Christ's Body, but all
such know it is a glorious Body: and so there needs not much be said to a Lie,
but the Truth will come over it; for no Lie is of the Truth: and though thou
boasts of a better Foundation then those thou accusest, yet all in the Light
know the Devil is the Foundation and Author of every lie; but who are in the
Light, and build upon the Light, are come to him that is the true Foundation of
Generations too, and of which Prophets and Apostles bare testimony, and is now
testified, that God was Light, and in him was no darkness at all; so Life and
Truth is over Darkness and falsehood; this is our Foundation that have not cried
up any Light, but Christ that Cornerstone that grinds to powder all that it
falls upon: and in page 11. thou go on to speak of Christ's Church, we
having said it was his body, as though thou would contradict that Truth as
well as others, say it is but his members for whom he laid down his Life;
but this heady notion being altogether, (say thou) condemned by Scripture, I
cease putting pen to paper in this matter: what thou meanest by the heady
notion, I well know not that, except thy own Accusation that thou speak
before; but if thou did apply it to thy precedent words, in saying, the
Saints were but Members, in contradiction to those that in truth say, his
Church is his Body; for thou art the first that would make difference between
the Members and the Body of Christ, that I have heard of; b^t some as blind as
thy self have gone about to make him two bodies; but Members without a Body, as
thou make, (with a but) I never heard of before: but his fullness, that
fills all in all, is known to them, and them only that discern his Body
spiritual indeed, and seen only with the spiritual eye, which being blinded in
thy self, thou would darken in others: And so thou go on repeating some
Scriptures; and then calling after thy wonted manner to see, that thou can
not show; and then again thou beginst, and say, thou give us to know, that
the Bedy of our Lord was humane; and when thou have gone on as well as thou
can to prove the first Adam and Christ one; then thou go to make a
difference, for this man, of whom we speak, is not the made Image of God, as
was Adam, say thou, but the express Image of the Fathers Person: so having
spoken of things thou understands not; thou brings a Scripture that thou
imaginest would prove it, by which thou provest thy own ignorance, both of the
day, and the Scripture, that thou art my beloved Son this day have I begotten
thee, which was (say thou) when the holy Ghost overshadowed Mary: All that
believe in the Light know the day of his begetting, Abraham saw it, and was
glad, David saw it, and testified of it hundreds of years before the Virgins
Conception at Jerusalem: So thou that would not have the Son of God begotten,
till he was conceived of Mary, who art not only out of the Faith of Abraham and
David, but blinder then the Priests of the World; for they have and do preach,
for ought I know, that he was begot and begetting from all Eternity, and that
the day of his Resurection was prophesied of by these words, This day have I
begotten thee; so thou have so much pored on the humane body (as thou call
it) that thou must bring forth a birth like thy conception in the dark* but I
think, there is but few that will bow to thy image, for thou can not give it
a seeming life neither from Scripture nor Reason.

And thou go on, and say, He calls not God Father, as we; but how will thou prove it? no more then thy other imaginations: for Christ says, My
Father, and your Father, without making a difference, but thou differs and
denies it: But thou deniest Christ, Prophets and Apostles words, if they will
not sure thy imaginations, and bring forth thy blasphemous thoughts: for the
Son, say thou, was from the Substance of the Father, which was not the Diety
that was begotten; so by thy words, would thou make it appear, that the
substance of God is not Diety nor Divine: O stop thy mouth thou imaginary man,
that in confusion and darkness would speak of that which thou art shut out
of! for the key of David thou have not, and so can not know the womb that
bare him which was pure, nor the seed he took upon him, nor his begetting; for
he, the Christ, was not conceived in sin, as thou were, nor as thou imaginest;
so thou were better be silent, then exercise thy self in things to high for
thee; for all that strive against the Light must be shut up in darkness, as
thou art: and so go on in thy (twelf page) saying, God was in Christ
reconciling; here thou have brought a Scripture to overthrow all thy former
Doctrine, for then it is not the humane that reconciles, but God; and then thou
go on to repeat what Christ says, had I not come into the World, you had
had no sin, but now your sins remain, because ye believe not on him whom God
has sent; for I come a Light into the World: and this his coming thou would
have only at that time at Jerusalem, as if he had not come before, or since. I
would enquire of thee, Was there no sin, nor sins till Christ was manifest at
Jerusalem? for had I not come into the world, you had had no sin: for the cause
of all sin was and is the not coming to him which saves from sin, who was, and
is, and is to come: and so he that was the Light says, I am come a Light into
the World, and the condemnation of the World was, and is, that men love
darkness better then Light; because they come not to the Light, their ^ins
remain; and who refuses the Light come not to him that they may have life, but
in darkness and death read and talk of the Scriptures, as thou do, that
brings this Scripture, that sat^h, God was in Christ reconciling the World to
himself, and that Christ says, I am come a Light into the World; seeming
thereby to prove, that Christ was begotten that day the holy Ghost overshadowed
Mary, and that in humanity or earthly, and not by Deity, as thou called it; and
all this thou say, to prove Christ is not the Light in the Conscience, and
then brings a Scripture where Christ says, I am come a Light, and that if he
had not come, they had had no sin: so instead of proving thy humane earthly
Doctrine, the Scripture proves, that the cause and ground of all sin, from the
entrance of transgression to this day, is the not coming to, or believing in
the Light; for here Christ condemns of Sin, and convinces of Sin, because of
unbelief in that which condemned them, which was the Spirit or Light: So thou
have brought Scriptures, that Christ says, he is come a Light, to prove thy
Humane against the Light; and it proves against thee, and for us that testify
of the Light.

But thou say in another place, Christ is not defusive, that is I confess, a
word that is neither Scripture, nor the Spirits Language: but if thou meanest,
he is not within his people, how does this Scripture overthrow thee in this
error, as in others? for the Light searches into the inner-parts, as thou
confessest; and I am come a Light, says Christ: so thou see the Scripture
manifests thy darkness and error: so thou would have been more covered if
thou had brought no Scripture, but had delivered thy Doctrine against
Christ a Light in the Conscience, and had brought thy Teacher J. B. to have
proved it: for so contrary to Scripture art thou, that in thy very following
words, page 12. where Christ says, I am come a Light, thou say, You have it
clear, and out of doubt, who it is that is the Savior, and the Lord Christ,
not the Light in Conscience, but he that died and rose again and this thou
would seem to prove by the former words, where Christ says, I am come a
Light into the World, and if I had not come you had not had sin: so that all
whose eyes are not dark see thy weakness, and that the Scriptures are for us
that love the Lord Christ, of whom the Scriptures declare, that say, he is a
Light, and this has enlightened every man; and yet thou art offended at those
that say he is in the Conscience, though thou say Gods Habitation is there:
but the Light, against which thou strivest, will wear out and destroy all thy
vain imaginations, for it is everlasting, and from Heaven, and must prevail
over thy humane earthly Image; yet that man Christ Jesus, all that learn of the
Light in the Conscience know and confess unto; and his Flesh is Meat indeed,
and his Blood is Drink indeed; and the World one day shall be judged by him:
but this thou, nor none that are in the Night, striving against the Light, know
or believe: so as a Thief in the night will he come on all such. But thou go
on with the repetition of a Scripture out of the Hebrews, of a high Priest
after the order of Melchisedeck, to make intercession for us; but how contrary
to thy purpose of proving thy humane Christ not to be begotten, till conceived
at Jerusalem, to be the high Priest that makes intercession for all: the wise
in heart can see, who have learned in the the Light that has visited us from
above, what the order of Melchisedeck is, no father, no mother, no beginning of
days, nor end of Life, who lives forever to make intercession for all that
comes to God by him: and this is the Christ of God, that thou, and all the
Despisers and Resisters of the Light are ignorant of, and so come not to God by
him that is without beginning of days or end of life; but in the carnal
comprehension would measure Heavenly things, and so brings forth earthly
imaginations, and by this would come to God, by your own devisings, as Babels
Builders of old; Thieves, and Robbers, that leave the Door, and for such he
enterceeds not; but for all that comes by him that is without beginning of
days or end of life, he lives to make intercession, even for all that in Truth
and Spirit Worship, and by the Spirit of Truth are lead into all Truth; such
that have abiding in, and testify of that, are come to the mystery of Faith
held in the pure Conscience: but this the Image-makers are ignorant of, as thou
that would set up an invented Light of the humane Soul, for a Habitation of
Rest for God, and those that God has given to Christ; in which thou have
bewrayed thy own ignorance of the Rest of God, and his people, which the
obedient and profiting servants enter into, even the joy of the Master, even
the Glory of the Father, which was before the world was; and this is not from
the Earrh, nor of the Earth, but before the Earth was: and so the Light and
Spirit of the human Soul that thou set up, as created to be a Habitation
for God, and those that God will give to Christ, will be thine, and thy
disciples burdens, in the day that you will most stand in need of Rest: but to
proceed, thou go on with thy own words, and some Scriptures that may easily,
by all that can see, come over thy darkness, and is as though thy self had
had a glimring of thy own darkness, and were afraid of the blows or smitings
due to thee, and so to save thy head, go on in words, as if thou meanest to
undo all thou had done; saying, thou must not be traduced by those that trade
in corrupted men's words, to the hindering of the passage of the Truth: but
before I take notice of thy following words, I have something to say to these:
who thou mean by traders in corrupted men's words, I know not; but some have
bin constrained, as I at this time, not to hinder the passage of Truth, but for
Truths sake; to bring forth the Truth over such like corrupt words and writings
as thine are; that the Truth may stand upon the head of deceit, that turns
every way to save it self, as thou do in thy following words, when after
thou have brought forth so many accusations against those that cry up the
Light, and borrowed so many Scriptures with thy own private interpretations, to
make truth thy seeming falsehood, and to set up thy own imaginary light: After
all and much more to this purpose, as if thou means thy self, (like the foolish
woman) to pull down thy own house, thou beginnest to preach in words, the same
that in words and writings thou publicly have so appeared against; saying,
This writing is not to draw the mind forth from waiting within it self, for the
manifestation of God in it self, for that which is to be known of God is to be
revealed in man: I answer, if that which is to be known of God be manifest in
man, is it not in the conscience? and is not that Light, that manifests? and
does not Christ say he is the Light? and does any bring to the Father but
Christ? and is any appointed to be hearkened unto for Life and Salvation, but
Christ? and thou confessest, in the Apostles words, that what is to be known of
God is manifest in man; and can any reveal the Father but the Son? which, thou
say, thou would not have any drawn forth from harkening to that which
manifests: which is that, and that only that the worshipers of the true God
testify of and to; and if this thou would not have any drawn forth from,
what meanest thy invented story, of a created Habitation within, and the Light
of a human Soul? so thou must confess thou have been setting up other lords to
attend to, then the Lords Christ, or else with us in the Truth, that Christ
only gives the knowledge of God in man; but thy windings to and fro manifests
what root bares thee: so I not meaning to say any thing farther to thy twelf
page, who ends it with few of thy own words, or thy Teacher Beamon, I shall go
on to thy 13th page, where thou say, that the promise is to the inward man
of the heart, being quickened by the holy Ghost: to this I answer, God is not
divided, wherever the Spirit is, Christ is, and of him have and do the
Witnesses of the Light testify the same yesterday to day and forever, the gift
of the Father, that was never known nor learned, but in the measure of his own
Spirit, as any may read, when Christ was visible amongst them at Jerusalem, and
discoursed with the woman of Samaria, he did not call her so much to the
beholding of his visible Appearance or Person, as to know the gift of God,
whereby she could only have the knowledge who he was; and though he was present,
he does not say, believe in this Person at any time; but believe in the Light,
that you may be Children of the Light: and when he came (that thou read of)
that said, Good master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal Life? he
does not say come, handle and feel this Person; but, says he, why call thou
me good? there is none good but God; for Christ knew then, and now, none could
sell all for him, but who in Spirit learned him to be God blessed forever; and
therefore he knew his going from them was expedient, that the promise of the
Father's Spirit of Life might be more fully poured out upon them, in which he
promised to be with them to the end of the world; and all that have Faith in
the Gift of God, which is Eternal Life, free unto every creature, are witnesses
thereof, and the Resurrection of this Light and Truth has and does torment the
whole World of Idolaters, that have or are hunting in the many ways, from the
one thing needful, the Kingdom, Power and Spirit in them: yea, in the Heathen,
at which the professing Idolaters rage, though the Scriptures in which they
trust, testify of it, that the very Crucifiers of Jesus had the Kingdom in
them; and so from they 12fth page to thy 15th, I have little to meddle with of
thy stolen words, of an in-eye and internal root, and of the stirring of the
center, which all that have read Jacob Beamon's mysterious mist of
imaginations, knows where thou had them: though thou would make people
believe they were thy own, and so namest not thy A^thours, as honest Writers
use to do: but letting all that pass, and thy so often repeating, as formerly,
the Light of Conscience is not the Christ: I answer, I never knew any but thee
say it was; so it seems thou have been a confuting thy self, hoping thereby to
confound others; but the Light only shows that in us, is not of us; but to the
blind all is alike, else surely thou would not after all thy Arguments and
framed Reasons to draw the mind from the Light within, to eye the Person
without, to confound and destroy thy own Doctrine, by saying, my intent in this
writing is not to draw the mind forth from waiting within it self, for the
manifestation of God in it self; for that which is to be known of God is to be
revealed in man: what, will the Scriptures (think thou by thy winding,
adding and diminishing) serve thee to prove or disprove, as thou would have
it? sure all that have an eye see thee, that have denied the Light within to be
either God, Christ, or his Principle, and yet would have them wait within for
it: what then would thou have them wait on? thou talkest indeed of a Sword
that God had set in the human Soul, to keep the way of the Tree of Life; then
Robert is the Tree of Life, where the human Soul is, and yet neither Christ nor
his Principle: and in the sixth page thou say, there is a Light in man that
is the Habitation of God; and in thy fourteenth page, that God has chosen the
heart of man for his Habitable Place: so it seems the Light thou speak of,
and man's heart in thy sense are one; and would thou have man wait within his
own heart, from whence proceeds all manner of evil; for thou concludest it is
man's duty to wait in his heart for the promise of the Father, and yet neither
Christ nor his Principle there, as thou say; and so if thou know another
thing to he waited on, or to open the heart then Christ, thou should have
declared it; for the internal Root, what is it? or that which can bring into
the heavenly Canaan, if not Christ? then thou have another root to be brought
to or wait on, then the Christ of God, or to lead then he, it is an Idol: So
thou that have been so long crying against them that preach up the Light within
the way to God, cries up an internal root, an in-man of the heart, and what
not, so thou may keep from the one thing needful, in the many things: Oh how
vain is man in his imaginations, and that continually! witness this precedent
relation of R. C. that would set up any thing of his own or others inventions,
to draw from the one safe, sure, and unalterable Way of Life; and which all
that are come to, and have life in, cannot but testify that it is almighty,
and in the strength thereof, as we receive, must testify against all and every
one that would deceive, or draw aside by subtle divising and craftiness of men,
to blind the eye of the mind, presents that there is other ways and means to
be looked to, and to be waited on, then the only begotten of God, which alone
has been testified of, and witnessed to by us that have learned of the Light,
and therein received the earnest and assurance of a Kingdom that cannot be
shaken; the sure rock against which Hells strength shall never prevail: And so
knowing assuredly that he is in us that saves from sin, and his name is Jesus,
cannot but testify against all Images, and their makers; for unto him alone is
our eye, that is from everlasting to everlasting, that in the fullness of time
took flesh upon him, and dwelt amongst us, and this is our Light, our Life, our
Root, Spirit and Power; and shall wear out all created lights, imagined
internal roots, and natures light, with all R. C's and others imaginations, who
not being able to get from under the Righteous Judgments of God, goes about to
speak evil of the things he knows not; and so the natural light, and the
spirit of a man and the light of Conscience, or what the carnal man can see and
know, being his own, he brings forth, and says, these are our opinions; so in
the Truth must all lies and falsehood be turned on the head of the liar, from
whence they come, and in Truth are we established more and more, having no God
but one, and he everlasting and almighty; who commanded Light tashine out of
darkness, and has shined in our hearts to give us the Light of the knowledge of
the Glory of himself in the face of Jesus Christ, and this is that I had of the
Lord to give forth as a testimony against R. C. his paper, entitled God's
Truth attested according to Scripture, about 8. months since, and about that
time was it written; but having the knowledge that a brother (whom in the Lord I
honor for his faithful continued service in and for God's Truth's sake) was
answering of it, I laid these my papers aside not knowing a use for them, not
looking on them, as I know, for seven months time; but about three weeks since,
or thereabouts, looking among my writings, I lighted on them, and had
something, as I was reading them, in my heart, that it must be published.

But not at that instant giving up clearly to it, the next night, or the next
after, the Lord visited me with a sore and dangerous Distemper of body, and I
being an ancient woman, that have and do wait for my change, received it as a
Messenger for my removal out of this Tabernacle of clay; and not at all
grievous unto me, having by obedience to, and by Faith in the Light obtained
redemption out of that which must come to an end, and an entrance into the Life
and Kingdom that shall never have end: so waiting quietly on my weak bed for
the revelation of his will whom I serve in my spirit day and night, what his
will and pleasure was to do with me, for I have learned that its better to live
to God, then to have a life in this World: and whilst I thus waited, my sleep
being short, I had in them several sights of something I was to suffer and do in
this present World, among which a sight of a late work of R. C. in which he
would bespatter the servant or servants of the Lord; and the morning after this
Vision, one came in and related to me, that R. C. had sent his Queries out to
G. F. and his ministers, but G. F's life is where the evil one, nor any of his
ministers can come; sent of God, Blessed, and a Blessing to the Generation of the
Righteous: Then the Lord cleared it to me, that what I had writ, or should
farther be given in unto me, as to or of R. C. to give forth, and then an
assurance I had of being healed of my weakness, and declared it to one Friend,
that the Lord had something more for me to do ere I went hence, and if but this,
in bearing testimony against this Instrument of the evil one, I shall lie down
in peace, for I speak the truth, I lie not, the Lord in a Vision by night,
before ever I saw R. C. in the outward, showed me him, and his dwelling and
family, in the night season, and that he should be a Troubler of the House of
God and cause his people to suffer; and I have seen and traced him in his work,
and am well acquainted with his outside love and feigning whereby he has
deceived some simple in his pretended singularity and elocution of his own
doctrine and way: and though he long walked with us, yet never came to the
knowledge of the Truth; and the old bottle being unbroken, such as he had, and
has, he brings forth of it, and has by cunning led some silly ones captive by
perverting the good way of God; yea, so prosperous has he been in his cursed
practice among those that were willing again to embrace this present world,
that he has perverted whole families, that were called with the high and
heavenly Call, but never come to the election; and so have been deceived, and
are found such as have taken the name of God in vain, and are not, nor shall
not be held guiltless; and though they have or may make merry over the slain,
perverters and perverted from the good way of the Lord, yet their Condemnation
slumbers not, and the Lord has and does behold their wicked works, that having
betrayed the Truth in themselves, would tempt others to believe a lie, as if we
were like unto themselves, and looked for Salvation by another way, then by
Christ Jesus the Son of God: so that none may believe a lie is this sent
abroad, that he, and he only of whom the Scriptures declare is our Salvation,
and there is not another way to God; and what is recorded of him, and by him in
the Scriptures of Truth, from the first of Genesis to the last of the
Revelation, knowing that they were given forth as holy men were moved of the
holy Ghost, and not of a private interpretation for the unlearned of this
Spirit, have and do interpret to their own destruction; for none have seen God
at any time but the only begotten, and they to whom he reveals him, and by
spirit only was and is made manifest, and that a measure of this is given to
every one to profit withal, the Scriptures bear witness; and this, and no other
is their Principle that are called Quakers; and by Faith we have profited,
dwelling in this Light and Spirit, know the blood of Jesus which cleanses from
all sin, and gives us fellowship with the Father and Son, in the measure of
this Spirit that has filled our hearts with love and good will unto all; and
so with the hazard of all this World has, through sufferings, accusations and
bad reports we pass, sounding forth the good will of God unto every one, that
he has given a measure of his own Spirit to profit withal; and they that will
not hearken unto it, will not believe though one from the dead should be sent
unto them; and this is that which was given unto me to be sent forth as an
answer, and to come over the imagined doctrines of R. C. in his first paper,
that is called the Truth at tested according to Scripture, but is found
contrary to Scripture and Truth, and by us testified against, that have cried
up no light but that which he that was sent of God bears witness to, Christ
Jesus.

These following Lines were added since Robert Cobbits Queries came to my hand;
and it is manifest, his own Work therein, has and shall ensnare him.
I Have read or heard of a Tyrannical Persecutor, that among other cruelties
invented to destroy the Christians; and one was, to have them rent in pieces
with wild Beasts, and to make the Beasts more eager of their prey, would clothe
the men designed for death in Beasts skins: that which brought this to my
remembrance, is, the late works of R. C. and one that writes her self E. A.
they being in the same design as the Tyrant was, to hinder the increase of
Truth, and to make the obedient thereto odious to all honest hearted people,
that are afraid of false gods and worships, by declaring that the people called
Quakers set up a Light to be trusted in, and learned of, and say, it is God and
Christ; and then make a relation of such a light as they have invented, which
they call by many names, and as far as I understand by several natures, as in
reading their writings any may see: saying, that the Light is the spirit of a
man, and the light of a humane soul, and a formed light, and the light of
nature, and the Accuser, and the worm that never dies; and yet also, that is a
Habitation or Dwelling for God, and those that he has given to Jesus Christ,
with many more such expressions of the insufficiency and badness of their
imagined light; and then again of the excellency of it, to and fro, for and
against; babble indeed: and all this to make people believe that we call to
such a light as they imagine, and have set up in their own brains (and that we
believe not in Christ the true Light) which manner of light (which they would
have people believe we preach up) is their own, and the burden thereof, which
they would lay upon the Lord's people, shall turn upon themselves; and the
snare they laid shall take them, and the least of the many thousands of Israel,
know their light is darkness; and thousands with me can witness, that have
constantly walked for these thirteen years, with these people, (that these
Instruments of envy and strife are risen up against) and that in all our time,
we never heard of any such light as they declare of to be trusted in; nay, I am
bold to say many thousands amongst us never heard of a formed light, to be a
dwelling place for God, and those he will give Christ, much less have we
believed in such a created lie: I answer for the Lord and his chosen, and in
his presence that searches every heart, that I am persuaded that thousands of
these people, called Quakers, would lay down their lives, rather then ever
confess or bow to such a Light as R. C's and E. A's, whom I am willing to join
together, for they have joined in one iniquity; yet there is not much danger
that her work will hurt any, as her self, being so contradictive in it self,
and to him that is in the same work with her, to call that which R. C. calls,
The Principle of Christ, and Gods Dwelling, the Tree of Knowledge, and in this
confusion calls the Quakers Mystery Babylon: and so all may see, that give heed
to the true Light, how these Perverters have gone about to clothe the true
Worshippers in their idolatrous and monstrous invented errors, that, by a Lie,
they might keep from believing the Truth, which all the Worshippers in the
Spirit of Jesus are led into; and never did the People called Quakers, since
the day of their first coming forth to this day, declare of any other Light,
then the Spirit of Jesus, that Word of God, that was with God before the World
was made, that as a two-edged Sword, divides between Soul and Spirit; but who
of this Word have not learned, sets up that spirit (that is to be divided from)
for the Word, and for the Light; here the Mystery of Iniquity entered, and is
upheld to this day, in a pretense of God, Antichrist setting man's spirit above
all that is called God, as God, Christ, and his Spirit, sets up a likeness, or
the spirit of man, to draw from the one Spirit that can only lead into Truth;
and the obedient thereunto declare, as they have learned, that by obedience to
the Spirit the Soul comes to be sanctified and separated, as says the Apostle
Paul, from all that separates from God; but the Apostle did not say this of the
Spirit of the Humane Soul, or the Light of Nature, but of the Eternal Spirit
that raised Jesus from the dead, and has quickened your mortal bodies, and this
is the Light and Life that we have declared of, the Spirit of Life that sets
free from sin and death, not divided from, but proceeding of Father and Son;
but of this R. C. and E. A. are not learned, as may be seen by their
imaginations of the Light and Spirit of Christ, which the People of God, called
Quakers, have testified of; but were it not for a full assurance I have, that
she and R. C. whom I am called to plead against, are Fighters against God, I
should never have waded in such dirt as they have brought forth; but being on
my heart, as an addition to what I have eight months since writ to R. C's
first, now to speak a little to his many Queries, I writ this as a preface
thereto; not so much for his sake do I writ, (though unfeignedly I wish he
might find a place of repentance) as for others whom he is seeking to betray;
and as the scope of his first work was to persuade people we preached of a
false Light and Christ, even such a one as he imagined; so in these his Queries
he would insinuatingly, by asking questions, and perverting the words of Truth
that have formerly been given forth, persuade the people, as if we denied
Christ Jesus, of whom the Scriptures testify: And though I have no life in
contention, but have and do labor in all things to avoid such questions as
gender to strife, yet having fallen on the vain janglings, and unprofitable words
that he has filled his paper with (for which he shall surely be called to an
account, with all other his idle words) and though it be not my purpose to be
large in the matter; though in every Query, and all his other words therein, he
manifests his folly and envy therein, with his vain repetitions, and
unprofitable questions, and may all be turned upon his head; yet I shall only
take a particular notice of some few of them, with some of the Lies he charges
the Lords people with, and the wicked and blasphemous imaginations he has of
the Son of God, and answer to him, as our Savior did to the subtle Generation
that came by questions to ensnare him, who instead of answering, gave them a
question which they durst not answer, neither would he give an answer to them,
neither should I, nor any of the Lord's people, (that have learned why we came
into the World, and cannot spend our time here unprofitably, but must answer
the will of him that sent us, that we may render our account with joy) ever
have put pen to paper to have answered R. C's first or last impertinent or
false matters, if not called of the Lord, for his Truth sake, and your sakes
that may be hindered, or hurt, or kept out of the Way of Peace, where we have
found him whom our souls love, and cannot but testify of his good will unto
all that his hands have made, and that you may believe the Truth.

For no other Way, Means nor Name did we ever find Salvation by, or declare to
be believed in for Redemption and everlasting Life, then the Son of God; and
that was and is he of whom the Scriptures declare, without any cover or deceit,
as our enemy intimates that he may deceive; but in plainness before the great
God that searches every heart, and has and will Judge in Righteousness every
false Speaker; no other Christ have we faith in, or testify of, then he that
was conceived by the holy Ghost in the Virgins womb, and brought forth in the
fullness of time, as it was prophesied of, and was carried into Egypt to be
saved from Herod, that pretended to worship, but went to murder the Child
Jesus: This was he that made a good confession before Pilate, and was slain by
wicked hands, but it was impossible that Death should keep him under, so he
rose and declared unto the woman that was a witness of his Resurrection that he
ascended, and gave her command to declare to others; and so whatever the
Scriptures, that were given forth by the holy Spirit declare of Christ Jesus,
his body, his Suffering, and Rising, and his Ascension, we believe; and he is
ascended far above all Heavens that he may fill all things; who was and is the
everlasting God, the mighty Counselor, the Prince of Peace; yet this I nor any
ever knew savingly (whatever we have heard or read of it) but as it came to be
revealed in us by his own Spirit, which was the promise of the Father, of the
Son, that were and are one forever; and (though R. C. blasphemously denies it)
he pours forth his Spirit on his Sons, and on his Daughters; and this is the
Covenant, that they should not depart from him, but be taught of him; and this
was it the Apostles spoke of, That a measure was given to profit withal, and
more we know not of God, nor Christ, then of this we learn; and as we receive
thereof, we give to others, and all that believe therein find profiting
thereby, and are brought into the plain Way, and feel their Redemption thereby,
and Jesus with them, that saves from sin, and so can no longer worship Idols,
and so all Image-makers come to be tormented, from him that sits at Rome, to
the least of all the Harlots brood; for of her they are, and in her sorceries,
that imagine and sets up any thing to be looked to or trusted in for Life and
Salvation, but Jesus Christ, which is only received and known by his own
Spirit: And this is the doctrine of the people called Quakers from first to
this present day, and forever, at which all Image-makers rage and are
tormented, that their Diana's must come down; and among which R. C. strugles
that his may have a place to be; for though he could never stoop to obedience
of Truth, yet he feels and knows it shakes his images as well as others, and
fearing the falling thereof makes lies his refuge; but the Truth has and shall
come over all, and my desire is even to the God of my hope (that is Light, and
in him is no darkness at all) that the honest in heart may receive this
Testimony, and it is true, that what ever has been given forth by Prophets,
Christ's mouth, or the Apostles, or any sent of God concerning or of the Son of
God, we believe, but deny and witness against all the imaginations of the
comprehending mind, that measures heavenly things in the earthly carnal mind,
that never could discern the things of God; so in this from first to last has
the mystery of iniquity wrought, and been brought forth, talking of the flesh
and blood of Jesus, yet never come to eat thereof, nor to know an effectual
cleansing thereby, but offering despite unto the Spirit of Grace which brings
Salvation, and whilst they are talking of the Blood that was shed at Jerusalem,
they trample the Blood of the new Covenant under foot, from the Mother of
Harlots to the least of her false begotten Children, among which R. C. is to be
testified against; and the call of the Lord is to come out from all their
Sorceries, the images and likenesses of heavenly things; to the Substance,
Power and Life, that the Lord in this our day has visited us with, the
dayspring from on high, the Hope of the Righteous in all Generations, that,
many are come to partake of, and receive Life, the Life that shall never have
an end; this is by the Spirit of Life: So blessed be all and every one that
has an ear to hear what the Spirit says.

R. C.
I Have looked over thy many Queries, and finding them unprofitable not tending
to the edification of any (but to stir up strise) so I said in my heart, If
thou had believed the Scriptures, or understood the words of Truth that has
often been sounded in thy ears, thou had never asked such Questions; some of
which thou know we never denied; and had thou ever come to the one thing in
which there is no Error, thou had not so run into the many things, in which
all err; and though thy darkness be great (as all must be that would have the
knowledge of God and heavenly things by any other way, then the Spirit of
Christ) yet I have cause to fear that in the Spirit that lusts to envy, thou
charges that upon us, that thou do not believe we are guilty of, for thou
hearing us so many years only to testify of the one thing, the Gift of God,
and the Spirit of Jesus, that faithful and true Witness, that was with God in
the beginning; and never hearing any that bear testimony to or for the Light,
speak of any other for Salvation, but the only begotten of God; could thou
think we meant any other, that thou should devise so many errors and false
Opinions to place on us, and yet not be able to bring any of our words or
writings (that so many years together thou were so conversant with) to prove
that we ever cried up any such things as thou charges us with? (what will the
end be of wilful sinning) did thou ever hear us set up or call to any
witness, but the Spirit of Christ? and thou beginst thy Queries of a witness
that we affirm to be God and Christ; and I answer, so we do, that faithful and
true one, that made all things, and we have this witness in our selves; and is
it honesty in thee to say this is but the spirit of a man? it is like that the
Witness thou witnesses with is a false spirit, but ours is the true; thou
should not speak evil of that thou know not; for thou art as unknowing it
seems of what we declare as unbelieving, that calls the Spirit or Witness we
declare of, the Worm that never dies; what, no difference R. in the dark I see;
what would thou have God and Divil one? that I hear indeed, is the Ranters
principle, which thou in this seems to be one with: what, no difference between
him that judges in Righteousness, and he that accuses? all that can be said in
this matter for thee, is, that thou have more knowledge of the Worm that never
dies then of him we believe in; but how thou can make good thy former
doctrine, that the Light in Conscience should be a Habitation for God, and
those that he has given to Christ, and yet should be the Worm that never dies,
I know not; for we believe no such confusion; for thou might as well have
said Hell and Heaven are one, and the Divil will never break the Serpents head,
as that thou have said, and these are thy own, for we testify of no such
witness, but against that and thee that so invents, for we are joined to, and
believe in him, in whom the Accuser has no part. And in thy twelf page thou
repeats some Scriptures that our Friends its like have put forth, which
testifies to Truth; as these words, He that has not the Spirit of Christ is
none of his, and that none receives the Spirit but he that believes in Christ
that is giver of the Spirit, to which thou addest these words as a Query,
Whether the Spirit you walk by is the Spirit of Christ, or the power of Magic,
Answer? to which I Answer, may not all that have an eye to see, see what spirit
thou art of, that so much speaks of Scripture, and when such Scriptures are
brought as smites thy Image, and testifies to the Truth, thou art so far from
answering any thing in plainness to it, that thou turnest into a Query, whether
our Spirit we walk by be the Spirit of Christ, or the spirit of Magic? O how
do thy evil thoughts and imaginations gender to strife, what ground have thou
to question this, but a lie of thy own framing? saying, we deny him to be the
Christ that was the offering for sin, which lie must turn upon thy own head,
for he that did and does live make to intercession for all that come to God by
him we confess to, and there is no offering for sin, but Jesus, whom we witness
to save from sin: so for thy Magic and Sorcery, it is thy own, for we have no
fellowship with them that work it, but know, that such as withstand the Truth
(as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, by bringing forth likenesses of what
Moses wrought in and by the Finger and Arm of God) they that bring forth a
likeness by their Sorceries, whereby the hearts of the Oppressors were
hardened, and the Seed which God would have delivered kept the longer in
bondage, and how deeply thou have been in this work of Jannes and Jambres thou will one day know.

And many of thy Queries, yea, the most tending only to ensnare, in asking, if
that Christ which was and did the things mentioned in Scriptures, be the Christ
or Light in the Conscience? to this I Answer thou art speaking as one that has
many Gods and many Lords, but we who walk in the Light have but one God and
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and he and his Spirit is one; so he that said
to his Disciples, that he which was with them (not divided) would be in them;
so one God do the Children of Light confess to, made manifest by his Son in
Spirit, and these are one; but thou in the second page of thy Queries say,
Christ is not the Eternal Father, and that he and his Father is not one; and
thy carnal Reason for it is, that he that gives is one, and he to whom it is
given another, and this to prove or maintain Christ and God to be two; well
may thou fight against us, and our words of Truth, that goes about to make
void or disprove the words of Christ, that says, My Father and I are one, when
he was in the Person thou so much speak of; but thou say they are two,
and the Apostle John says (John 1. 3.) all things were made by him, and without
him was nothing made that was made; and the Apostle Paul says, all things were
made by him and for him; but thou R. C. art not ashamed to deny the words of
the Apostles, and say plainly, all things were not made by him, thou
blasphemously going to comprehend the things of God in thy dark mind, denies
the words of Christ.

And in thy nineth page say, I see not wherein you are wronged in being
charged to deny God and Christ, in a Place, above Sun, Moon, and Stars, and
Elements; nay, it is like thou do not, nor will not see our wrong, that art
so great a Wronger of us, that in so many years as thou watched us with an evil
eye, yet not having from our own words, to charge us of error or evil, comes
forth as publicly as thou can to set the World against us, by telling them
we cry up and worship such a light as thou have invented, and thou might as
truly have said, that we denied God any where as that thou had said; but let
Truth come over all thy former Lies, as this, God being our Witness that we lie
not, but have and do confess before men, that our Lord is above and over all
created things, the Earth, the Heavens, and all therein, the works of his Hands
in whom we believe, God blessed for evermore, whose Throne is Heaven above all,
and the Earth his Footstool, and under his Feet shall all his Enemies be put,
then will every Image-makers be brought down, and every Liars mouth be stoped,
and false Accuser; and he that invents wrong shall have no place, but that
which is prepared for him.

And in thy nineth page thou Queriest, if the Christ, which John said was the
Christ, or the Light in man be the Christ, which G. F. says is the Christ;
explain, say thou: To which I Answer, without guile in the Truth, I have
known G. F. as thou neither have nor can know him, while thou fightest
against the true Light, and thousands can witness, that of God he was sent, to
bear witness of the same Light and Christ, which the Apostle John bear witness
to; and there is but one Christ what ever thou imagins, in whom was and is
Life, and this Life is the Light of men, and this is the true Light which
enlightens every man that comes into the World; but thou and all that love
darkness better then Light, cannot comprehend the true Light, and so despisest
the Messengers thereof, growing in envy against them, as Cain against Abel that
offered in Faith, and had this Testimony that he pleased God; but Cain in the
unbelief grows angry, and rises against his brother; and so those who through
the unbelief, loving darkness better then Light, rise up against the witnesses
of Light, if it be Apostles, or G. F. or who ever, as thou R. C. do, who
deny'st John's words, that says, All was made by him (the word Christ) and
thou plainly say it is not so; for he did not make himself, (say thou) so
none will marvel thou can not see nor receive G. F's testimony of Christ,
that cannot receive John's testimony; yet no other Christ then he that gave
life for all men has G. F. testified of, and we know he lives for ever, and he
and his [mark] no comprehender knows, who was from eternity to eternity; and
though in the days of his humiliation his Judgments was taken from him, who can
declare his generation? not thou, which vainly asks what is become of him the
Christ which the Scriptures declare of: to which is answered, he is every
where, (and all things are upheld by him) and in us of a truth, that in his
Light have believed: But thou and all that in the imaginations of your own
hearts, are stiving against the Spirit of Grace, cannot wait for or discern his
appearance, and therefore ask what is become of him.

And in thy eleventh page thou Queriest, Whether Peter's witness in his
Conscience, by which he confessed Christ to be the Son of God, was not as much
God and Christ, as the Witness in you? I Answer, Christ told Peter, It was the
Spirit of his Father, and Christ's answer has and does satisfy all that
believe in him, and that Father, Son, and Spirit are one; which then did and
now do speak in us that believe, to the torment of all vain imaginers, as art
thou, that asks if the witness in us be any other then that in Peter, which
Christ bears testimony to, and that to him; but thou say the witness is the
Worm that shall never dies. This was the Spirit that called the Master of the
house Beelzebub, that makes a slight thing of the Spirit of the Father, as if
less then God or Christ, by which we that believe are saved, and have
fellowship with the Father and Son, and all that are in the Light, where the
blood is witnessed, which takes away all sin; and of it, and to this Spirit we
witness, that thou in thy first page say, it is the Spirit of a man, and the
Worm that never dies, and that against our doctrine thou must testify: So
repent of thy blasphemies if thou can, it is a fearful thing to fall into the
hands of the Living God: but to draw to a conclusion of speaking much more to
thy Queries, the most being but repetitious of the like unprofitable stuff, I
shall a little take notice of what thou say to them thou call thy old
friends, (and if I have not fully answered, yet I have given thee what is given
unto me, and am clear; it shall stop thy wicked purpose, and the Lord has many
valiant Soldiers for his Truth, that shall yet smite every enemy that rises up
against the Faith, till your Chariot-wheels be struck off, and you all
swallowed in the deep, who do what you can to stop Israel in his way; but Hells
strength shall not prevail against our Rock Christ, revealed in Spirit, receive
it if thou can) and thy old Friends, as thou call them, thou go on to
speak to, whom thou say, thou would not have fall short of entering the
Rest; and then urges it by a lie; but if they were dreaming of such a Rest as
thou imagins, and in thy first Book calls it a Dwelling place for God and his
people, and in these thy Queries, the Worm that shall never dies, which it will
be well for all to fall short: but whom do thou account thy Friends among
us, if it were such as knew thee, when thou appears to be that thou were not,
though they may pity thy soul, yet can they do less then abominate thy
hypocritical practices, for so many years together that seemed to be, and were
not? and if to the plain hearted thou speak, that hates deceit and every
evil way, thou will not by thy feigned words get any entrance; but if by the
old Friend, thou meanest those that once took the name and profession of Truth
in their mouths, as much as thee or more, and by their own unbelieving hearts,
and thine, or such like Betrayers, are drawn back, such manifesting they have
taken the name of the Lord in vain, and the Lord will not hold them guiltless,
for they have and do grieve his holy Spirit.

And which of thy Rests thou have preached to these I know not, but their
obedience to thy Earthly spirit, they manifestly hold forth in their returning
again to their vomit, and as Swine to wallow in their former Mire: the
Ministers of the Light and Grace of God, have called and do call out of the
World, and the Customs and Fashions thereof, to him that was not, nor is not of
the World, Christ Jesus: but to whom have thou called, that have brought to
brodered Hair, Gold and Pearl, and boldness of Face, instead of shamefaceness
and modesty, to cringings and bowings, worshipping of Creatures instead of
sobriety and fear; and more might be spoken, if convenient, of those thou have
perverted from the Way of Truth and Honesty; and these if they repent not, will
not fall short of thy Rest, The Worm that shall never dye; and then thou give
an exhortation to beware that no man deceive you, for the Spirit foreseeing
what would be in the latter days, foretold a departure from the Faith, and
that men should rise up, bringing in most damnable errors, and denying the Lord
that bought them, and many shall follow their pernicious ways, of whom the Way
of Truth shall be evil spoken of; so thou drawest to an end as thou beginest;
for as thou would have people believe that we worshipped and believed in such
a god as thou imagin'st, and then placest conclusions on thy own invented
doctrine, so the evil thou divisest must fall upon thy self; for here thou
brings a Scripture, that there should be a falling from the Faith, and would
place it on us, now that the evil spoken of by the Apostle is and does come
unto all that deny the faith, is true, but is it we or R. C. that have denied
the Faith? let the wise in heart judge, for the Faith which the Scriptures
speak of, by which the Saints did overcome the World, but the Faith which R. C.
has preached, has carried back into the World Know the Tree by the Fruit,
they that in measure were redeemed out of it, having again embraced this
present World, and they are such as deny the Lord that bought them, even such
as the Apostle Jude speaks of, that like the first Angels, that kept not their
first state, and likewise that kept not their Habitations, but despises
Dominion, and speaks evil of Dignities, so these speak evil of those things
they know not; but what they naturally knows as bruit Beasts; now is not this
R. C. and his Disciples (that have risen up against the Dignities that are from
above) running into the way of Cain, and perishing in the gainsaying of Corah;
has not his envy made it manifest? O forget not, for as it was spoken it is
come to pass, the Earth has swollowed up many of you, and none shall escape
that divise against the Worship in Truth and Spirit, and sets up a formed
Light, and natural Light to be the dwelling of God and his people that he has
given to Jesus Christ: So thou art manifested to know nothing, but what thou
know naturally, as a bruit Beast, and so appointest a natural rest, for
those that believe thy doctrine, and warns thy old Friends, not to fall short
of it, for it seems thou know not another then what thou know naturally;
but they who are come to the Law of the Spirit of Grace, that sets free from
sin and death, know there is a Rest prepared for the people of God, and an
entrance thereinto many have and do witness, and are set down in heavenly
Places, with Christ Jesus; and this Rest and Glory was before the World was;
not a formed, but that which Christ testifies of, he had with the Father before
the World was; and this shall abide when all thy imaginations shall cease, and
thy formed Rest fail thee: O how restless then shall thou be, when thy hope
shall perish! but our hope standing in him, that is without beginning of days
or end of life, we shall never be ashamed; and all that have this hope purify
themselves as God is pure.

So to thy imagined Rest, thou art left, where thy trouble and torment will be
increased, though thou and those deceived by thee, and their own evil hearts,
have rejoiced in iniquity, and if any by disobedience to or unbelieving in the
Light have been overtaken with evil, or run into the pollutions of this World,
this you Backsliders have gotten to strengthen you in your envy and
back-drawing, though your own appearance manifests you are one with them that
have forsaken the good Way of God, and the precious Truth, to return to the
vanities and customs of this present World, denying his blood that has called
out of the World, and the Judgments of him that judges in Righteousness you
shall not escape; but as one shall you all be judged, which have despised the
Spirit of Grace, or have turned from it into wantonness; so your portion shall
be one from first to last, that have left the good way of God, and profained
the Name of that Power and Life in which we that believe have and do know the
fulfilling of the promise, and are become partakers of the Divine Nature, and
born again thereof, and thereby to inherit Life and immortality, and an
entrance into the Kingdom which all you are shut out of, and have no part in.

And know to the increase of your torment, that have writ against the Light,
thousands in faithfulness thereto, are kept out of the pollutions, yea, and
love of this World, and witness redemption out of all that which must come to
an end, and to us are daily added, and shall be added, all that shall he saved;
we have not believed a Lie, but the Truth, and it is stronger then all, and
shall wear out your Envy, and shall overcome all your invented Images and
Mischiefs that you have divised against the Lord and his Anointed; for the
expectations of the Righteous in all generations is come, and who through the
regeneration have passed, are sat down on Thrones, and do and shall judge the
Tribes of Israel, but our reward you cannot see nor partake of, who have been
unfaithful to him that called you, and so never came to the Election, but have
betrayed it, as faras it lay in you, and have grieved many little ones; and
better had it been for some of you, that you had never been born, or that a
Millstone had been hung about your necks, and you thrown into the bottom of the
Sea, then a wrought the work of evil against the Lord and his Truth, which he
will more and more raise up and increase against and over all the strength of
Hell; and they, and they only, are thy Friends R. C. that in plainness warns
thee of the wrath to come, which shall overtake thee, and all that harden their
hearts, and stop their ears against that which sometimes pricks them, though
they kicks against it; and some that are stout-hearted shall confess unto, when
their Joy and Hope shall come to an end; but the Lovers and Obeyers of the true
Light have Peace and Joy in that which is endless and everlasting; therefore
the evil purposes, and accusations, and threats of those that disobey the
Gospel cannot disturb nor make us afraid.

So we would that all men (with us that believe in the Light) might come to the
knowledge of God and be saved; but who hate the Light abide in darkness, and
brings forth confusion as R. C. has done, and there I leave him; only Query of
him, as follows.

I. IF the Light and Witness (thou say) the Quakers declares of the worm
that will never dies; then, where is the Rest thou said before that God had
made or created for his People in the Light in or of the Conscience? answer.

II. Do thou imagine the Worm that never dies, and the Rest to be both one?
answer if thou can.

III. And I query, since thou have given so many names to the Light in or of
the Conscience, for it seems thou know not which; saying, It is the Dwelling
of God; and sometimes a formed Light; and sometimes a Rest for the People of
God; and sometimes Natures Light; and the Spirit of a man; and the Worm that
shall never dye: I query, if the spirit of a man, and natures light be a
Dwelling and Rest for God and his People that he has given to Christ, as thou
have said? prove if thou can by Scripture.

IV. I query of thee, what the Conscience is, of whose light in or of thou have
brought forth so many strange Images? and though thou have not brought one
Scripture for thy many names of the Light in or of the Conscience; what is
Conscience? declare if thou can.

V. I query, if thou can bring any Scripture for proving God's Dwelling and
his people in the Light of the humane Soul? or that the spirit of man is the
Rest? or that the Rest and the Worm that never dies be the Light of or in the
Conscience as thou affirmest? Answer if thou can.

VI. Query, Was it not the true Christ of which John speaks, he was slain in
the great Street spiritually called Egypt and Sodom? and is he slain in that
Person that was visible at Jerusalem? or who, or where? Answer if thou can.

VII. I query, John says, he that is born of God sins not, how should he? for
the Seed of God abides in him: is that Seed Christ in his Person? Answer, for
the Apostle Paul says, he speaks not of Seeds many, but the one Seed Christ.

VIII. Query, And did this promised Seed Christ never break the Serpent's head?
but in the Person which was made manifest at Jerusalem? and if he did, where
and how? answer.

IX. Query, Whether it was the Person at Jerusalem that came down from Heaven
and was the Son of man in heaven? that could only ascend to Heaven, or what?
Answer.

X. Query, And whether that Talent taken from the unprofitable Servant, and
given to another, was the Worm that never dies? or a formative Light? or the
spirit of the earthly humane Soul? or the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil,
as E. A. talks of? or what? Answer if thou can.

XI. Query, Whether does the Son of God abide with his to the end of the World?
is it in Light or in Person? Answer.

XII. Query, Whether Christ, who told his Disciples he that was with them would
be in them, whether he has fulfilled his Promise? (for he cannot lie) and if
in them, is it in Person or by Light? Answer plainly.

XIII. Query, Whether the Unction or Anointing (which the Apostles said should
teach them all things) was Christ in his Person without, or Christ in them?
answer.

XIV. Query, Christ told* those that followed him, except they eat his Flesh
and drink his Blood they had no life in him: So I query, whether it was that
Person they were to eat and drink, or what? if thou can, answer.

XV. Christ says, he that eats my Flesh, and drinks my Blood has Eternal
Life; now I query, if they eat that Person? or who they are that have Eternal
Life? answer if thou can.

XVI. Christ says, he that eats my Flesh and drinks my Blood dwells in me,
and I in him; now I query, if this dwelling be in Person, or in Light? answer
plainly.

XVII. Query, Whether the Accuser of the Brethren that was to be cast down from
Heaven was the spirit of a man? or the light of nature? or the Worm that shall
never dye? or the Habitation and Dwelling Place for God and his people? since
in thy writings thou make all these one; Answer plainly.

Several Lies in R. C 's Second Page.
1. THat we say Christ is only an Example. These are but a few of thy many
false Accusations.
2: That we despise his Flesh, and trample his Blood under our feet. 3. That we
set up the creaturely light in Conscience, for Christ and his Light. 4. That we
deny him to be the Christ that in his Person was an Offering for Sin. 5. That
we deny Christ in Heaven. 6. In thy 16th page, that our Teachers teach entrance
into Rest by Works of obedience to the Light of Nature.
These things thou never heard'st nor read'st by any of those thou call'st our
Preachers: So thou publishest to the World, that we hold that which thou
think, and so declar'st thy self a false Accuser.

Postscript.
THis rose in my heart for your sakes, that would know the will of God to do
it, and are rather waiting to have him work your works in you, then labor in
your own imaginations to know and comprehend the incomprehensible God in your
minds, where all Images and idolatrous Worships have been framed and brought
forth, yea from the same ground all wickedness and blasphemies, from the first
transgression to this day, by all that went out from God, and then as Cain
would offer of their own; and so have his generation all along to this day,
those born of the Flesh, warred against those born of the Spirit, who
worshipped in the Faith, as we do, confessing to know nothing of God and his
everlasting Truth, but as we are taught and led of this Spirit, and in this
know both Father and Son, and receive power thereby to become the Sons and
Daughters of God; and cannot but declare of his Glory and Good will who has
sent us, that according to the measure received of him, we may Glorify him; of
whose Grace we have received Grace for Grace; and know his continued Good will,
even to all and every one that believes in his Light and Word of which the
Scriptures testify, both by Prophets and Apostles, as it is written, Amos 4.
13. 1 John 1. 1. Heb. 4. 12. and of another Light and Word did we never Write
or Declare; then of Jesus the First and the Last, which they that have erred
from, are offering despite to us, as R. C. in his Practice and Writing does;
who having walked some Years amongst us, as if he had been one of us, yet not
bowing to, nor believing in the true Light, where Power is received, grew in
Envy against those that were in it, by which he and such like have been given
up to a Reprobate Mind, to change the Invisible God into the likeness of
Corruptible Things, as R. C. has in his first and last; as may be seen and
read in his vain Imaginations of God and Christ; uttering his Lies and
Blasphemies against God and his Tabernacle, some of which I have in my
foregoing lines recited, that all may see he is contrary to Scriptures and
Truth, and to us, that no more any may be deceived by him.
