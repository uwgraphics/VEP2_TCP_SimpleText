AN ANSWER TO A PAMPHLET INTITVLED The Lord George Digby His Apology for
himself; Plainly discovering the cunning untruths, and implicit Malice in the
said Pamphlet against the Just and Legal proceedings of the Honorable the
High Court of Parliament.

London, Printed for Thomas Johnson, Anno Dom. 1643.

An Answer, to a Pamphlet, entitled The Lord George Digbyes Apology for
himself.
MEeting with a Pamphlet, entitled the Lord George Digbies Apology for
himself; and being well acquainted with the excellent gifts and natural
indowments of the man, I could not choose but with a great deal of desire
venture on the perusal of the said Pamphlet, which indeed began with so much
modesty and harmelesnesse, that I did begin to entertain a very good opinion
of the rest; but therein the said Lord played his masterpiece of craft, to make
his sufferings, as it were, the preamble to that Discourse; so to beguile the
minds of the vulgar Readers, and allure them to commiserate his misfortunes,
by the displaying and protesting his innocence, and consequently his injuries:
and surely so subject is man's nature, especially the wavering multitudes, to
pity misfortunes, even in the most desperate malefactors, whom before in their
wishes they had devoted to a thousand deaths and torments; that when they
evidently see them suffer, they are very apt to compassionate their dist^^^^.
So I believe it is with this young Lord, who having with his fair andspecious
Apology, as the ancient used (even their capital offenders) provare ad
populam appealed to the peoples censure, he ho^es) he shall by the winning
and imploring language of his said Apology, entice and persuade them to an
absolute belief of his innocence, nothing being more uncertain then the
minds and votes of that giddie and blatant beast, the multitude.

But to judicious and discerning eyes, who weigh every circumstance by
judgment, not passion, this his Apologeticall discourse will rather appear an
absolute accusation then a disingagement of him from his crimes, that goodly
and verdant grass being not of height enough to hide the swelling and
invenomed Serpent that lurks under it, which in spite of my Lords fained
modesty will break out and declare the rankour of his heart toward the good
of the Commonwealth, and the proceedings of the honorable the High Court of
Parliament of which he says, he was once a Member, and demeaned himself
with that free and just deportment for the good and advancement of the public
affairs, that he had gained a very good opinion whilst he was in the lower
House, still associating himself with such of the said House, as were most
forward in the Commonwealths cause. That he did all this, is confessed: For
men can never gain any thing by detracting from an enemy; and that he did
proceed with much zeal and diligence in that which befitted him in the
public affairs; in especial, about the trienniall Parliament, and the
business of my Lord of S^^fford, against whom he declaimed with much
judgment and discretion, but afterward in that very business which with so
much acrimony and and courage he had pursued, to wit, the att^inder of the said
Earl, he fell off, even against his own conscience, being then touched with
that first some of the Angels, ambition, which makes men like poisoned Rats,
who, when they have once swallowed the pleasing bane, rest not until they
drink, and then can rest much less, until they burst with it: For about this
time, diverse of those subtle Malignants, taking special notice of the growing
virtues and admirable abilities of that young Lord, thought it advantageous for
their purpose, by drawing him with the line of honor to their purpose, to
withdraw him from the service of his Country, which he had so courageously
undertaken; and therefore intimating to his Majesty his abilities, he was
instantly by writ called out of the lower House, where he was by election a
Burgess, into the upper House, where by that new creation he was to sit as a
Baron and a Peer of the Realm. Besides, as himself confesses in his
Apology, there was notice taken, and advisement given him by a friend, that
he was lost in the opinion of many by his frequenting the Court; and indeed,
he was so, for then the young man's nature being wrought upon by the
persuasions and promises of those subtle Malignants, and puffed up by their
manifesting his immense deserts and hopes of a signal and sudden preferment,
he then turned recreant to his former virtue and care of the Commonwealth,
declining it, in regard of his private advancement and profit; and then, to the
wonder of all, and grief of most good men, he fell off from his opinion in
that case of which he had formerly been so great a patron, and then made that
infamous and unhonourable Speech, so much detested of all true lovers of the
Commonwealth, which by order from the honorable the high Court of PARLIAMENT
was publicly burned by the common Hangman; a Speech indeed deserving no
better destiny, then to be sacrificed by the fire to oblivion; and neither the
finenesse of my Lord Digbyes wit, nor the comptnesse of his phrase, can by both
their endeavors excise that Speech of absolute apostasy to his former
integrity; nor incite to believe that so many honorable and wise men as were
then resident in the House of Commons, would have condemned that Speech to so
much infamy, and proscribed the Author incapable of honor and office in the
commonwealth, had it not been stuffed with unpardonable and apparent abuses,
both to the honor and utility of the State; and therefore to no reasonable man
can my Lords Vindication of that Speech appear valid. But not to insist too
long upon this Article, let us descend to the examination of that which
declared him a professed enemy to the State, namely, the business at Kingston,
whither he protests he only went by his Majesty's command, to deliver a
message to some Soldiers and Cavaliers, not with any intention or act of
hostility, or rankour against the Parliament: Let us but rightly consider the
men with whom he went to treat, and out of that will appear my Lords
equivocation at least, if not absolute falsehood in this point: First, these
forty men he talks of, were at least eight score, all of them of the
Commanders that were in the Northern expedition, men for the most part of as
desperate souls as fortunes; and that these men were drawn thither, either by
the Lord Digby's persuasions, or some others of his stamp and condition, is
evident, in that the said Commanders were destined as a leife guard to his
Majesty, into whose head my Lord Digby, and such other Malignants, had subtly
instilled fears and jealousies of his sacred persons security, against which
no man would ever be so audacious as to have a thought of harm; and so got his
Majesty to entertain those Cavaliers, being indeed aptly to be resembled to
those desperate Gladiators among the Romans.

And whereas my Lord excuses himself, or at least thinks he does so, of all
these machinations and practices, by alleging he is not of his Majesty's
Council; grant it, yet having his Majesty's ear as well as Master Porter and
the rest of his Cabinet-councellors, it is cer^^ine his Lordship might give as
dangerous advices as the most perverse Malignant among them: Virtuous men, when
they once decline to vice, are of all others the most vicious: as among the
Turks none are so deadly and desperate enemies to the Christians as Christian
Runnegadoes; and whereas my Lord says, if he had been of the Council he
could have detected diverse, who said the King was not worthy to live, and words
of the like barbarous and disloyal consequence; why did not his Lordship
declare and appeach those persons, that they might have been given up to the
Laws punishment, which certainly the honorable the High Court of Parliament
would have seen with all severity inflicted on them. And though his Lordship
does so much stomach his being called and declared Traitor to the King; if he
had committed nothing else, cerrainly this concealment so long of the author of
such words is safficient to convince him of Treason; but if actually to levy
war against the Kings people, be Treason against the King, as my Lord
apparently did at Kingston, then is my Lord Digby guilty of Treason, not
otherwise; if to be the author and abetter of ill counsels to the King, and
dangerous and destructive to the peace of the Kingdom, as is evident my Lord
is, by his intercepted Letters, wherein he required his Majesty to withdraw to
some place of strength and safety from this Parliament, be to be a Traitor,
then is my Lord so, otherwise innocent. And for his Lordships withdrawing by
the Kings license out of his discontents into Holland, in hope that tract of
time might reconcile him to the good opinion of the people, and abolish the
memory of his disgraces; the falsehood of this pretension is more apparent them
any of the former; and that my Lord went over merely as an agent to promote
and advance the distractions between his Majesty and his Parliament, by
procuring foreign ayds, which by his own Letters is testified against him,
that he endeavored both in the Netherlands, and in other parts; as also by the
information of sundry Merchants of good credit from thence, my Lord desiring to
have himself written unto by the name of Baron of Sherburne. Next from whence
came all those supplies of ammunition and arms to Newcastle, but from my Lord
Digby and his accomplices. Finally, there is nothing in all my Lords
well-penned Apology, that is worthy any judicious man's belief or pity,
unless they may in Christian charity grieve that so many rare^ and excellent
parts as are in the man, should be so mis-imployed: for past question by this
that is here set down in answer to his said Apology, it is manifested
perspicuously how ill a title my Lord can lay to innocence, and how evidently
malicious guilt has been contiguated with all his actions, since his revolt
from his duty to his mother the Commonwealth, from whom he can deserve no
better a^ style then that which the honorable the High Court of Parliament
has affixed upon him.

FINIS.
