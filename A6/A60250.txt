READER.
THis was done at first in another language And albeit I know that there is so
much sobriety in the most able, who put pen to paper in those days, as makes
them to find some scarring upon their own spirits: when they suppose, how many
of those who look upon a new book, may happen to welcome it into the world,
with a word of snuffing disdain, Tush, the world is too full of books already.
Yet I am some what above the fear of the hardest censure for this small and
indirect accession to the adding of one poor sheet more; that I am rather
confident that (Read who will these few pages) his conscience within him (such
as it is) will extort so much from him, like a testimony to the ways of God
that he shall at least say, O that I may dye the death of the righteous, and
that my latter end might be as his. And that the Reader, who is taught the
fear of the Lord, will be farther enlightened and refreshed, and persuaded of
the ways of holiness. And more particularly of these few things following.
First, that there is a Holy Ghost which dwells in, and shall be with the saints
for ever. And 2. that he is the comforter who alone can and should comfort the
soul. And 3. that his consolations are not small; by which there is singing for
joy of heart and glorifieing God even in the fires, and by which beleivers are
enabled to laugh at destruction and famine, and dearth and pestilence, and to
lift up their heads, and be able to stand before the Son of God, though they
should live to see the greatest distresses of nations, and the shakeings of
heaven and earth: which make the hearts of the stout to stoop, and fail. 4.
That the pure ordinances of Christ are noe vayn things but ought to be much
followed and cleaved unto, and that there Christ gives his loves. 5. That the
word is that sword of the Spirit, and there is none like it against that Goliath,
that red Dragon, that Leviathan, and the King of Terrors. How mighty was this
young Damsel in the Scriptures, and the young one wanted not his own number of
Scripture places: by which, through grace, they did quit themselves like men,
and overcame: and, at their death, declared themselves, by the faith and
consolation of the Scripturs, to have attained to the stature of perfect men.
Christians, know what hour it is of your day, and what is your work. Be
faithful in the lesser or greater things of opportunity and means of working
out your salvation. You do not know what evil may be upon the earth; albeit we
know, that the Cup of trembling (go round as it will) from Nation to Nation,
from Church to Church, from City to City, from Family to Family: yea, often,
it begins at the house of God, and his own sanctuary. Ezekiel. 9. 2 Pet. 3. But
yet a little while, and it shall be taken out of the hand of the Lords people,
and the dregs thereof shall be wrung out by all the wicked of the earth, and that
most Signally, by Antichrist, apostates, seducers, persecuters, and others
also, who have a form of Godliness and deny the power thereof.

THE LAST HOURS OF SUSANNA BICKES in the 14th year of her age.
SUSANNA BICKES borne in Leyden Ianuarij 24. 1650. was visited / from the hand
of the Lord / with the Pestilence / upon the 30. of August 1664. being
Saturnday / betuixt 7. of 8. at night. And after the beginning of her sickness
/ there were considerable presages of her death. And very speedily she betook
herself to the great Physician of soul and body. The first night / she
exercised herself to earnest prayer / by herself alone (without many words / or
speech to others) that God would furnish her with strength in her soul / to
bear out that great conflict / which she did apprehend to be approaching with
the waves of death: that she might by faith and patience / as becomes a dyeing
Christian / partake of the victory / which Christ has purchased over death /
to all these / for whom he himself had tasted of death. And as God had blessed
the preaching of the word abundantly to her / and the exercises private and
publict / upon the Cathechisme: So / that she had acquired a mervellous measure
of knowledge / and daily increasing in the same / from the very day that she
was in any capacity to learn: So / what instruction she received in the
grounds of Religion: it did so take hold upon her / that not only she retained
the notions thereof in her understanding: Bot the impressions of the truth were
engraven upon her heart / of which she gave remarkable proofs at this time of
her death. And that the word of God had dwelt plentifully in her: whereby she
was enabled to speak unto herself / and to sing with grace in her heart /
making sweet medoly to the Lord / while surrounded with the billows of the
King of Terrors / marching in battle array against her / with the terrible
slaughter weapon of the Pestilence. As abundanly is evident by the ensueing
words uttered by her / and faithfully collected; and / by the advyce and help
of some judicious and Religious persons / published / for the use of others
both old and young. The account whereof might have been much larger then here
it is done; but that several things did escape the memories of the bystanders
/ and of the Penman / being partly through grief / and partly through wonder
/ diverted from the exact noteing of the things which she uttered.

At the beginning of her sickness / she was heard / with much feeling and power
/ breaking forth to God with these words of Psalm, 119. If thy law were not my
delyt I should perish in my affliction. Whereupon her Father said to her: be of
good comfort my child / the Lord will be near unto thee / and us / under this
heavy and sore tryel / and will not forsake us; although now he chasten us.
David / by these words / belike / meant of the Lords hand which had been heavy
both upon his house and upon his person several ways. Whereof we read in the
Scripture. Yea Father / said she / Our heavenly Father does chasten us for our
profit that we may partake of his holiness. As we read Hebr. 12. 10, 11. And
albeit (as it is said there) no chastening for the present time seems to be
joyeous bot grievous: nevertheless, afterward, it yields the peaceable
fruit of righteousness unto them who are exercised by it. The Lord is now
chastening me upon this sickbed / and I hope he will bless it so / as to
make it to yield unto me that same blessed fruit / according to the riches of
his mercy and compassions which fail not: and then sighing to God with her
eyes up to heaven / she said: be merciful unto me / o Father / be merciful
unto me poor sinner according to thy word.

And looking upon her sorrowing parents who stood by her. Father said she / It
is said in the 55. Psalm. verse 23. Cast thy burden upon the Lord: and he shall
sustain thee: for he will never suffer the righteous to be moved. Therefore /
dear Father and Mother / cast all your care and sorrow upon the Lord who shall
make all things go well that concern you. Oh (said the Mother) my dear child
/ I have had noe small comfort from the Lord in thee / and the fruits of his
grace in thee / whereby thou have been so much exercised unto godliness in the
word / and prayer / and religious and gracious discourse unto thine own and our
comfort and edification. The Lord himself / who gave us thee / make up our
loss of thee: If it be his pleasure that we must now part one from another. D.
Mother (said she) albeit I leave you / yet God shall never forsake you: for it
is said Isai. 49. 15, 16. Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should
not have compassion on the fruit of her womb: yea she may forget: yet I will
not forget thee. Behold I have graven thee upon the palms of my hand etc. Oh
comfortable words both for mothers and children. Mark dear Mother / how fast
the Lord keeps and holds his people that he has them (even) graven on the
palms of his hand. Therefore think with your self / that albeit I must part
with you or ye with me / yet the Lord shall never separat from you or me.

She being wearied through much speaking / desired to rest a little: and after
a very little tym she awaked. Her Father asked how it was with her / but she
asked what day of the week it is now. Her Father told her / it was the Lords
day. Well said she / have ye given up my name to be remembered in the publict
prayers. Her Father told her he had done so. I have learned / said she / that
the effectual fervent prayer of the Righteous does avail much. The two
worthy Ministers / who are aftermentioned / she would have much desired they
should have been by her / but from her love to them / being much tender and
careful of their safety / she would not have them desired to visit her: but
rather satisfied herself to be cast upon the Lords own hand / and to accept
of / and improve the visits of others / whom the providence of God should send
unto her: or those (who being judged by the Church sit for the visiting of the
sick in these caices of hazard) arewont to come with more freedom. Of whom
their was one who used to come several times to her / and who was through the
Lords blessing useful to her: to whom she gave hearty thanks for his visit.
And one tym / after he was gone / she began to weep bitterly / and her Father
asked her the cause. Have I not matter for weeping / said she / for what I have
heard / but just now / by the visiter: that Domine de Wit was to day taken
sick in the pulpit / and went home so unwell. which is a sadd token for the
people. For / when God is about to smite a Land or a City / often times he
smyteth and removes their Pastores / and ought we not then to lay such a thing
to heart. although for my part / I know that I shall not long live to behold the
evil which may come / and which I have helped to procure als well as others.
And therefore I pray with David Psa. 25. Remember not, O Lord the sins of my
youth, nor my trespasses, according to thy tender mercy, remember thou me for
thy goodness sake, O Lord. Oh how do I long; even as the Heart pants after the
water brooks, so pants my thirsty soul after thee, O God. My soul
thirsts for God, the living God. Oh how does my soul thirst all the day
after thee, O God. Psa. 42. And farther / in the words of that 51. Psalm. Have
mercy upon me, O Lord, according to thy loving kindness; according to the
multitud of thy tender mercies, blot out my transgressions. And so forward to
the 11. verse / which she much insisted upon / often repeating the same /
especially the 5. verse / Behold I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my
mother conceive me. Upon which words she enlarged her meditation and speech /
according as she had learned from the Scriptures and the Catechism / and the
books written thereupon for explication / concerning that subject of original
sin. This is comed / said she from the disobedience and fall of our first
parents in paradise / that our nature is so corrupted; that we are all / and
altogider conceived and borne in sin: So we read also Genesis 5. 3. Thus / Adam
(it is said) begat a son after his own liknesse. Sin is not of God / for he
has formed man upright in the beginning; but he has sought out many
inventions. Eccl. 7. 29. Therefore, as by one man sin entered into the world,
and death by sin, and so death passed upon all men, for that all have
sinned: but death reigned from Adam to Moses; even over them who had not sinned
after the similitude of Adams transgression. Romans 5.

She spoke also many things very judiciouslie of the old man / and the putting
off the same: and of the new man / and of the putting on thereof: from Ephesians. 4.
and then she fell again upon the 51. Psa. and these words / The sacrifices of
God are a broken heart, a broken and a contrite Spirit, O Lord, thou wilt not
despise? that brokennesse of heart / said she / which is built upon / and /
flows from faith: and that faith which is built upon Christ / who is the
propper and alone true sacrifice for sin. And heerupon she spoke of the
offerings and sacrifices of Abel and of Cain. Hebr. 11. 4.

Thereafter she desired to rest and having slumbered a little / she said / ah
dear F. and M. How weak do I find my self. My dear child / said her Father /
God shall in his tender mercy strengthen you in your weakness. Yea Father /
said she / that is my confidence / for it is said Isai. 42. The bruised reed he
will not break, and the smoking flax he will not quench. Should I not then
believe / read Hebr. 11. How Abraham being proved of God did by faith offer up
Isaac in sacrifice. Oh what a steadfast and loyal faith was that of Abraham /
which made him willing and ready to offer that his own one son. Oh / what
is faith? Faith is the substance of things hoped for, and the evidence of
things not seen. Heb. 11. 1. Also 2. Tim. 2. 19. the fundation of God stands
sure, having this seal, The Lord knows those who are his own. Bot now dear
F. and M. why weep ye so over me / knoweing so well / I hope / that if the
Lord shall be pleased to take me out of this lamentable woeful world / it shall be
well with me / and that therewith ye ought to be content. It is said Psalm. 115.
Our God is in the heavens and does all what soever he pleases. Yea / we pray
every day that his will may be done on earth as it is done in heaven. Now
Father / this is Gods will / that I ly upon this sickbed of this diseas.
Therefore we must be content that it be to us according to our prayer. Otherwis
we then should murmr against God: without whose good pleasure / nothing comes
to pas. Although I be thus stricken with so heavy and sadd a diseas: yet it is
the will of God / and there is my silence. Therefore I will pray that his will be
done and not mijne. Therefore / Father / never doubt of Gods providence / for it
is said Matthew. 10. are not two sparrowes sold for a ferthing and that not one
of them falls to the earth without your Father, yea the hairs of your head
are also numbered. Therefore fear not: ye are better then many sparrowes. And
Lam. 3. 38. There goes not out of the mouth of the almighty good and evil.
Adversity and prosperity are both good. Some things may seem evil in our eyes
/ but the Lord turns all to good. Amos 3. 6 Shall there be evil in the city
which the Lord does not. Comes not the Pestilence from God. What mean those
people / who say that it comes by the air? and is not the Lord the Creator and
the Ruler of the air / and all the Elements. Or / if it come out of the earth:
yet is it of the Lord. What talk they; that it came which a ship which was
come from Africa. We have long ago read together out of Lev. 26. 25. I shall
bring a sword upon you to avenge the quarrel of my covenant, and where you are
assembled in your cities, then shall I bring the pestilence in the midst of you.

After this / she sought some rest again: and having slumbred a little / she
said / O now my dear Fat. and Mot. now is this day for the opening of the first
quest. of the catechism / and if we were there with others; we should hear /
that whether in death / or life; we are the Lord I. Christ's / our faithful
Savior / who has by his own precious blood redeemed us from the power of the
devil. And the following words / Romans 14. 8. for none of us lives to himself,
and none of us dies to himself, for whether we live: we live unto the Lord,
and whether we dye, we dye unto the Lord, whether then we live, or dye, we are
the Lords. Then be comforted: for whether I dye / I shall dye to the Lord / or
if I live I shall live to the Lord. The life which God at first gave me; I have
as yet / and so long as the soul is in the body there is hope. wherefore then
do ye so much afflict yourselves. But what shall I say: with weeping I came
into ye world, and with weeping must I go out of it. Oh my dear parents /
better is the day of death then the day of ones birth. Eccles. 7. 1. There is a
time to be borne, and a time to dye. If my time to dye / be not comed, I shall
then not dye. So then ye must comfort yourselves / and think that God shall
make all well. Ah my d. F. and M. let us pray together / and pray the Lord with
me; that he would vouchsafe upon me a quiet and peaceable passage through
death. Her Father / after he had prayed. being full of fatherly sympathy and
care of such a child; both in what concerned her soul and body / asked her /
if he should once more bring the physician to her. Nay / said she / the Doctor
shall do me nothing / nor can he help me / but I hope abundantly that my
heavenly Father shall help me. Well / said her Father / my child we shall use
the ordinary means: and let the Lord bless / as he sees good. Yea / said she
/ dear Father / the heavenly Physican is the true helper: he shall help / he
can help both soul and body. It is said Matthew. 11. 28. Come unto me all ye who
are weary, and heavy laden and I will give you rest. See there / Father /
there is the helper / even as Psa. 50. call upon me in the day of distress: I
shall delyver / and thou shall glorify me. All who are in trouble / must call
upon God alone / for when humain help is done: then begins Gods help for
them who call upon him in truth and in faith. Therefore let us once more pray.
After her Father had prayed / the friend abovementioned came to visit her / and
as the Lord had so opened and enlarged her heart that every word spoken to her
from the Scriptur took hold upon her with refreshing impression / so was the
visiter also much refreshed by her / wondering at the grace of God in her / and
that she spoke so pertinently and aftectionatly to her parents / for comforting
them. And so after she had bid him thanks for his visit / he took his leave
with tears: which were tears als much of joy as sorrow. When he was gone / she
asked what day is it now / they told her / it was Monday. Then said she / to
morrow is the catechizing day in our quarter. There is one thing I will
earnestly beg of you / Father / and that ye will promise it to me / and that
is; that ye shall go to Dom. de Wit and Ardinois, and thank them for the
learning and instruction which I reaped by their catechizing / and tell them
that these excellent and brave places of Scripture which they taught me upon
the catechism at the meetings in the Kirk / have been / and are blessed of God
for my comfort / now upon my death bed / yea / are useful unto me / for my
salvation. Oh that sweet catechizing: unto which I did alwis resort with
gladness / and waited upon it without wearieing / until it was ended. I have
seen and understood / that there is so little comfort and good / and so much
vanity in the Kermis and holy idle days of play / that I have grieved / and
been ashamed both for young and old people / to see them so glad and mad upon
vanity. Also dear Father ye shall give thanks to my Schoolmaster / and
Mistress; who taught me the first beginnings of my reading / I entreat and
hope that ye will do so / and not forget my thanks to the Ministers / as ye
have already promised. Yea / said her Father / I promise you I shall / if the
Lord preserve my life and health (which accordingly he did / at convenient
occasion / on her behalf: which was refreshing / and acceptable to these
worthy men / as if it had been a present of another nature / from some greater
personage.

Being wearied and weakened with speaking / she sought some rest; and having
turned her to the wall / she slumbered about a quarter of an hour / and being
awake / her Father asked how she did / and expressed somewhat of the great
satisfaction and contentment he had in her reading / and writing / and her
religious profiting. Yea Father / said she: in that ye have been so careful for
me / to get me to read and learn / has been better to me / then if ye had
provided ten thousand gilders of portion for me: for thereby have I learned to
comfort myself out of the word of God.

Her Father perceiving her groweing weak / said to her / my dear child / I
think thou becomes very weak. Yea said she / I feel it so more and more / as
also your grief for me / I see / does increase / which is a piece of my
affliction. be content I pray you / it is the Lord who does all this. And let
us (with David 2 Samuel 24. 14.) fall in the Lords hand; for his mercies are
great. David, while his child was sick / he fasted / and ate not: but when the
child was dead / and God had declared his purpose in it; then he did eat. Yea
/ why should I now fast / said he? can I bring him back from death: I shall go
to him, but he shall not return to me. 2. Sam. 12. 23. so ought ye to comfort
yourself also / after my death / and say / our child is well; for we know that
they who trusted in God / are well. My dear Mother / who has done so much for
me / ye must promise to me / that after my death ye shall not sorrow so much:
for I am afraid for you / when I consider your grief for me / and for my other
sister / and brother / who are gone through death before me. And consider your
neighbor / who has lost her two sons / and has no more children. Ye shall
both of you promis me / that ye will comfort one another. Comfort yourselves
with Job, who having lost all his children, said, the Lord has given, and the
Lord has taken away: blessed be the name of the Lord. Do ye not think but it
went very sadd with him. Ye know well that Christ said to the Apostles Joh. 16.
33. In the world ye shall have tribulation. But be of good comfort: in me ye
shall have peace: I have overcome the world. And must the Apostles suffer so
great tribulations? and shall not we endure some what. Yea / has not Jesus
Christ my only life and favior / in the garden of Bethsemane / swatt blood for
my sake. was he not mocked / and spitted upon in Jerusalem: and / thereafter /
nailed unto the cross: and a spear thrust through his blessed side: and all
this for my sake; for my stinking sins sake. Yea there he cried with a loud
voice: my God, my God, wherefore have thou forsaken me. Now thus has he
purchased his church with his own blood. Act. 20. 28. From the cross is that
precious blood to be gotten / which alone can cleanse us from all sin. 1.
Joh. 4. 7. There did Jesus hang naked / who has purchased to me the garment of
salvation / and clothed me with the rob of righteousness. Isai 6. 10. And
salvation is in none other besides him. Yea there is no other name in heaven,
or earth among men, by which to be saved. Act. 4. 12.

Oh dear F. and M. I wax more and more feeble / and weak. oh / that I may
quyetly fall asleep in his bosom: and till then / he may strengthen me / and
take me in his arms / as he did the little children / and said Mark. 10. 14.
suffer little children to come unto me, for of such is the kingdom of God. And
it is said verse 16. he took them in his arms, and laid his hands upon them,
and blessed them. I lie here as a child. o Lord / I am a child; receiv me
into thy gracious arms. o Lord / grace / grace / and not justice / for if thou
enter in judgment with me I can not stand. Yea no living shall in thy sight be
justified. Psalm. 143. 2. for there is none who sins not. 1. k. 8. 4. 6.

Thus with continued speaking she became very faint / and all her strength
seemed quite gone; yet she forced a cry more / ah my dear mother / ah how faint
and feeble. This did so pierce the heart of her mother; that she could say
nothing / but ah my dear child. Then began she again to comfort her mother: so
long as my life is in this body / there is hope / said she. If it should pleas
the Lord to recover me to life and health: how careful / and earnest would I
be to pleas you / in my work / and learning / and what ye would require / and
lay upon me. And here upon again being a little more revived / the Lord renewed
her strength wonderfully / to speak as before / and to comfort herself / and
her parents / out of the scriptures / sayeing with the Apostle Romans 8. 28. we
know that all things work together for good to those who love God; even to
these who are the called of God, according to his purpose. O God / establish me
with thy free spirit: that I never fall from thy love. Yea / its said there /
who shall separat us from the love of Christ. I am persuaded that neither life,
nor death, nor Angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor
things to come, nor height, nor deepth, nor any other creature, shall separat
us from the love of God; which is toward us in Jesus Christ our Lord. Also Joh.
10. 27, 28, 29. My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me,
and I give unto them eternal life, and they shall never perish, and no man
shall pluck them out of my hand. my Father, who gave them me, is greater then
all, and none shall pull them out of my Fathers hand. But now let me rest a
little.

After some slumbering / she spoke to her Father again / with much gladness /
and joy of heart. It is said / says she 1. Cor, 15. 54, 55, 56, 57. death is
swallowed up of victory: o death where is thy sting; o Hell? where is thy
victory, the sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law: but
God be thanked who gives us victory, through our Lord Jesus Christ. There ey /
see that my dear savior has overcome death? and the sting of death? who then
would not be earnestly content to dye. For we must all once dye. We are from
the earth / and to the earth we must return / the dust is mother of us all.
Eccl. 12. 7. the dust shall turn to dust, from whence it is, and the spirit to
God, who gave it. So that my spirit shall turn to God / who is the giver of
all things. But oh / what is man's life upon earth. The days of man upon earth
are as the grass, as the flower of the field, so he floorisheth. The wind
passes over it, and it is no more. And his place knows him no more. Psalm.
103. 15, 16. And if a man should live long; yet the longer he should live / he
should the more have sin. Psalm. 90. 10. The days of our years are threescore
and ten years. And if by strength, they be fourscore: yet is the strength
thereof labor and sorrow. Now the Lord shall free me from all that labor / and
that sorrow. Suppose / and think with yourselves / that ye were both sick / and
the Lord should come and take you from us / and leave us poor children behind
you? How far greater loss should that seem for us. Is it not better that the
Lord remove us first / who would / belike / have so few friends behind you. Bot
we know not the thoughts of the Lord: yet we know / they are peace and good /
and not evil / and to give an expected end / unto good. But oh? what shall I
say; my life shall not continue long / I feel so much anxiety. Oh / Lord / look
upon me graciously: have pity upon my weak and distressed heart / my
distressed soul: I am oppressed / undertake for me / that I may stand fast and
overcome. Here again / a little reviving / she said.

It is said / Joh. 14. 16. I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another
comforter, who shall remain with you for ever, even the spirit of truth. O
Lord let him not leave me. O Lord continue with me / till my battle and work
be finished. Without thee I can do nothing. Ioh. 15. 5. I am, said Christ /
the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. ah / ah / my God let me be a
branch of that living vine. Oh / what are we poor worms / who can of ourselves
do nothing. O dear Father / how lame / and halting go we in the ways of God
and salvation. 1. Cor. 13. 9, 10. For we know but in part, and we prophecy but
in part, but when that which is perfect is come: then shall that which is in
part be done away. Oh that I had attained to that. Now? but what are we of
ourselves. Genesis 6. 5 see / not only / the weakness / and nothingnes / but also
the wickedness of man: that all the imaginations of the thoughts of the heart
are evil, and only evil continually. and Ephesians. 2. We were by nature the
children of wrath, and are conceived and borne in sin, and unrighteousnes.
Psalm. 51. Oh / oh / this wretched and vile thing / sin. But thanks be to God
who has redeemed me from it. Romans 8. 15, 16, 17. Ye have not received the
spirit of bondage again to fear: but ye have received the spirit of adoption,
by which ye cry Abba, Father. It is the spirit which witnesses with our
spirit that we are the children of God. And if children, then are we heirs;
Heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ. Thence ye see / Father / that I
shall be a fellow heir with Christ / who has said Joh. 14. 2, 3. In my Fathers
house are many mansions, I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go to
prepare a place for you, I will come again, and take you to my self, that
where I am, there ye may be also. O Lord take me to thy self. Behold / dear M.
he has prepared a place and dwelling for me. Yea / my dear child / said her
Mother he shall strengthen you / with his holy spririt / until he has fitted
you / and prepared you fully for that place / which he has prepared for you.
Yea Mother / it is said in Psalm. 84. How lovlie are thy Tabernacles, O Lord of
hosts: my soul does thirst, and longs for the courts of the Lord: one day in
thy courts, is better then a thousand. Yea / said David / I had rather be a
doorekeeper in the house of my God, then to dwell in tents of the wicked. Read
that Psalm D. M. and therewith ye may comfort one another. As for me / I am more
and more spent / and draw near to my last hour. Pray with me. Pray that the
Lord would vouchsafe unto me a soft death. And when they had prayed with her /
she turned her to her Mother / and with much affection / she said / ah my dear
and loving Mother / that which comes from the heart / does ordinarily go to
the heart. Once come and kiss me before I leave you / and also my dear father /
and my sister. And / father / let my sister be trained up in the ways of God /
as I have been / I bewailed and weeped for my sister / thinking she should dye;
and now she weepeth for me. Also / she took her young little sister in her arms
/ a child of 6. months old / and she kissed it with much affection / as if
her bowels had been moved: and spoke with many heartbreaking words / both to
the parents / and the children. Her father said to one standing by; Take from
her that poor lambkin / from the hazard of that fiery sickness. Give her
from you: for ye have too much already to bear. Well father / said she / did
not God preserv the 3 children in the fiery furnace. Ye yourself learned me
from Isai 43. 3. When thou passest through the fire, thou shall not be burnt;
neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.

After this / she had some little rest / and being awaked / she said. We read 1.
Cor. 15. 42, 43. The body is sown in corruption; but shall be raised
incorruptible. It is sown in dishonor, but shall be raised in glory: it is sown
in weakness, but shall be raised in power. Behold thus it is / and thus it shall be
with my poor mortal flesh. Revel. 14. 13. Blessed are the dead who dye in ye
Lord, because they do rest from their labor, and their works shall follow
them: Isai. 57. 1, 2. The righteous perish, and no man lays it to heart; and
the upright are taken away, and no man regards it; that they are taken away
before the evil which comes. They shall enter into peace: they shall rest in
their beds, every one who have walked in their uprightness. Behold now father
/ I shall rest and sleep in that bedchamber. Also Job says / chap. 19. 25,
26, 27. I know that my Redeemet lives, and that he shall stand at the latter
day upon the earth. And though, after my skin, worms destroy this body, yet in
my flesh shall I see God. Whom I shall see for my self, and mine eyes shall
behold, and not another; though my reins be consumed within me. Behold now /
father / this very skin which ye see / and this very flesh / which ye see /
shall be raised up again: and these very eyes / which now are so dim / shall on
that day see and behold my dear and precious Redeemer. Albeit the worms shall
eat up my flesh; yet with these eyes shall I behold God: even I myself and not
another for me. Joh. 5. 28, 22. Mervell not for this: for the hour is coming,
in the which all who are in the grave, shall hear, and come forth: these who
have done good, unto the resurrection of life. See / Father / I shall rise on
that day / and then I shall behold my Redeemer; then shall she say / come ye
blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared fore you, before the
beginning of the world. Behold / now I live, yet not I, but Christ lives in
me: and the life that I now live in the flesh, is by the Faith of the Son of
God, who loved me, and has given him self for me. I am saved, and that of
grace, through faith: and that not of my self: it is the gift of God. Not of
works: to the end that no man should boast. Ephesians. 2, 8 9, My dear Parents / now
we must shortly part: my speech fails me. pray the Lod for a quiet close to
my combat. All our dear child / how sad is that to us / that we must part.
Yea said she; I go to heaven / and there shall we find one another. I go to
Jesus Christ / and to my Brother Jacob / who did so much cry to God / and call
upon him / to the very last breathing: and to my little sister / which was but
three years of age / when it dyed: and when we asked it? if it would dye: yea /
said it / if it be Gods will / I will go to my little brother if the Lord will.
Or / I will also stay with my Mother / if it be his will: but I know that I
shall dye / and go to heaven / to God. Oh / see how so small a babe / to which
so much grace was given / as to have it self / every way / and in all things /
so subjected / and submitted to the will of God: as if it had no will of it is
own / it said alwise; If it be the will of God: if it pleas God: Nothing for it
/ but as it was the will of God? the pleasure of God, etc. And therefore / dear
F. and M. give the Lord thanks for this his free / and rich grace: and then I
shall the more gladly be gone. Be gracious then O Lord unto me also / be
gracious to me: wash me thoroughly from my unrighteoushes, and cleanse me from
my sin. It is said Isa. 1. 18. Although your sins were as skarlet, they
shall be white as snow. Although they were red as crimson, yet they shall be as
wool. Behold / God has washen away my sin. Oh how do I long: for in this
body, said the Apostle / we earnestly sigh, and groan, longing for our house
which is in heaven; that we may be therewith clothed. 2. Cor. 5. 2. Now I also
ly here sighing / and longing for that dwelling / which is above. In the same
sermon / which I heard / or shall ever hear / on earth; I heard of this / in
the new Kirk: which is matter of great comfort now unto me.

Then she brought forth several notable scriptures / which were quoted in
that sermon / especially. Revel. 22. And then she called for prayer. Pray with
me / said she / that my sins may be forgiven me / and that I may have the more
abundant faith / and assureance of it / and the comfort of that assureance /
and the strength of that comfort / according to my necessity. She prayed
herself / and continued a pretty space.

After prayer (in which she insisted principally / for pardon of sin) she
said / my (...) parents? have I angered / or grieved you / at any time: or done
what became me not; forgive it me. O poor child / say they / if all children
carried so to their parents / as thou have done / there should be less grief and
sorrow / upon all hands. And if any such thing had escaped thee / we would
forgive it / with our wholl heart: you have done (...) a good child.

The heart of her being quieted by her peace with God her Father in the heavens
/ and her peace with her parents on Earth / then she began to dispone her books
/ and other little things: and as the grace of God had made her so wise unto
salvation; so she did show some proportion of christian prudence / almost in
every thing / smaller / and greater. My dear mother / said she / ye shall keep
my Catechize book / in remembrance of me. Ye shall keep Dom. de Wits
Catechisation / so long as ye live: and let my little sister have the other book
/ as my remembrance. In the mean while / she told that she found her heart
exceedingly pained / and overwhelmed / and that she knew that her life should
quickly pass away. Her Father speaking a word / as he was able / hoping the
Lord would be near with his strength in this sad hour of her necessity. Yea /
said she / The Lord is my shepherd: Although I pass through the shadow of the
valley of death; I will not fear, for thou art with me: thy rod and thy staff
shall comfort me Psa. 23. And it is said / Romans 8. the sufferings of this
present life, are not worthy to be compared to the glory which shall be revealed
in us. Shall I not suffer and endure: seeing my glorious Redeemer behoved to
suffer so much. Oh how was he mocked / and spitted on / and crowned with
thorns / that he might parchase a crown of righteousness for us. And that is
the crown / of which Paul said / 2. These 4. 7, 8. I have foughten the good
fight, I have finished my race, and kept the faith. Henceforth, is laid up
for me, a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, shall
give unto me in that day: and not only to me, but to all who love his
appearing. 1. Cor. 6. 20. Ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in
your souls and bodies, which are his. Must I not then exalt / and bless him /
while I have being / who has bought / yea bought me with his blood. Isai 53.
Surely he has borne our griefs, and took our infirmities: and we esteemed him
smitten and stricken of God. But he was wounded for our transgressions, and
bruised for our sin: the chastisement of our peace was upon him, and through
his stripes are we healed. And the Lord has laid on him the iniquities of us
all. Joh. 1. Behold the Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the world.
Behold / that Lamb is Jesus Christ; also / for my sins / he has satisfied.
So said Paul 1. Cor. 6. 11. Ye are washed, ye are sanctified, ye are justified
in the name of the Lord Jesus, and through the Spirit of our God. My end is now
very near. Now shall I put on white raiment / and be clothed before the Lamb /
that spotless Lamb / and with his spotless righteousness. Now are the Angels
making ready to carry my soul before the throne of God. Those are they who
are come out of great tribulation, who have washed their robs, and made them
white in the blood of the Lamb. Revel. 7. She spoke this with a dying voice:
but full of the Spirit / and of the power of faith. And this her lively
assureance / and persuasion of her salvation / she further uttered with the
words of Paul / 2. Cor. 5. 1, 2. For we know, that if this earthly house of
our tabernacle, be dissolved; we have one, which is built of God, a house not
made with hands, but eternal in the heaven. For in this we sigh for our house,
which is in heaven, that we may be clothed therewith. There / Father / ye see
that my body is this tabernacle / which now shall be broken down. My soul
shall now part from it / and shall be taken up into heavenly Paradise / into
that heavenly Jerusalem. There shali I dwell / and go no more out; but sit
and sing / holy, holy, holy is the Lord God of hosts, the Lord of sabbath. And
her last words; O Lord God, into thy hands I commit my Spirit. O Lord be
gracious / be merciful unto me a poor sinner; and heerupon she fell asleep.
Being the 1 of September in the evening betwxt 7 and 8: having obtained / very
remarkablie / that which / so often / she entreated of the Lord: to wit / a
soft and quiet departure / and the end of her faith / the salvation of her
soul.

The last words of her Here follow the last words of her BROTHER JACOB a child
of 7 years old.
THis little child was visited by the Lord with a very sore sickness / upon the
6 of August: three or 4 weeks before his sister / of whose death we have given
some account already. For most part he sleeped till near his death. That which
he spoke ordinarlie / when he was awake; is / in these few words fowowing /
communicated to the christian Reader. So often as he awaked / he gave himself
to pray. Once / when his parents had prayed / they asked him? if they should
not / once more / call for the physician. Nay said her, dear Fa. and Mo. I will
not have the Doctor any more: The Lord shall help me. I know he shall take me
to himself / and then he shall help all. Ah my dear child / said the Father /
that makes my heart sore. Well / said the child / Father / let us pray; and
the Lord shall be near / for my helper. And as the parents had again prayed /
he said / come now dear Fa. and Mo. and kiss me. I know now / that I shall dye.
Adieu dear Fa. and Mo. adieu my dear sister: adieu all. Now shall I go to heaven
unto God / and Jesus Christ / and the holy Angels. Father / know ye not what is
said / by Jeremie chap. 17. Blessed is he who trusts in the Lord. Now I shall
trust in him / and he will bless me. And 1. Joh. 2. Little children, love not
the world; for the world passes away. away then all that is the world: away
with all my pleasant things in the world. away with my dager (which a Student
had propined him) for where I go / there is nothing to do with dager / and
sword. Men shall not fight there / but praise God. Away with all my books / for
where I go / there is nothing ado with books: There I shall know and be
learned / sufficiently / all things of true wisdom / and learning / without
books. The Father being astonished with wonder / knew not well what to say; but
/ my dear child / the Lord will be near to thee / and uphold thee. Yea / Father
/ said he / the Apostle Peter says. God resists the proud but he gives
grace unto the humble. I shall humble myself under the mighty hand of God; and
he shall help / and lift me up. Ah my dear child / said the Father / have thou
so strong a faith. God will strengthen thy says. Yea said the child / Father
/ God has given me so strong a faith upon himself / through Jesus Christ; that
the Devil himself shall flee from me: for it is said Joh. 3. He who beleiveth
on the son, has everlasting life, And has overcome the wicked one. 1. Joh.
2. Now I believe in Jesus Christ my Redeemer / and he will not leave nor
forsake me. but shall give unto me eternal life. Then shall I sing holy, holy,
holy is the Lord of Sabbath. And with the short word of prayer Lord be
merciful to me a poor sinner. He quietly breathed it out / and sleept in the
Lord. August 8. 1664.

To conclude; we may see here / by the mouth of these children (being, as it
were, two or three of that blessed cloud of witnesses. Hebr. 12. 1.) That
verified / which we read / Isa. 65. 20. THE CHILD SHALL DIE AN HUNDRED YEARS
OLD. Reader I have noe more to say to thee; but / as thou would wish to live
for ever / stand in alw of that which follows / immediately / in that same
verse: BUT THE SINNER / though AN HUNDRED YEARS OLD, SHALL BE ACCURSED.
