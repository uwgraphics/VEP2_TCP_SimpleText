THE PREFACE.
I. IN Our Translation of the London Dispensatory, we did intend to Complete
that Book, with all such necessary Additions as the Modern way of Practicing
requires; but finding the Book to swell beyond its designed Limits; whereby,
had I done, what I first designed, it would not only have been very Cumbersom,
but also past the possibility of being bound up in one Volumn, I was
necessitated to cut off much of the matter; and so much the more, for as much,
as that it was in great have of coming forth, and designed to be Sold at an
easy price.

II. But that the first Design should not totally fall to the ground, I have
reduced the Surplussage of what the former could not receive into the following
Method; and in the two last Books, the Titles of the Chapters both in the
Dispensatory, and in the Supplement Answer one another, the latter containing
only what the former wants.

III. This Work we have divided into three Books; the I. Book is a Supplement
to the Materia Medica, containing, as well as particular Additions, a System of
the general Notions, relating to the Practical use of the same; wherein among
other things, we have completely handled the Composition of Medicines, both
Medically and Mathematically; as also given you a special abstract of Chemical
Preparation, directed to the most useful things in particular. The II. Book
contains a Supplement to the Internal Compound Medicaments. The III. Book
contains a Supplement to the External Compound Medicaments, all Classically
answering to those in the Dispensatory.

IV. In this Tract, as you will find the Art of Chemistry Exemplifi'd, together
with an Idea of the process of the universal Medicine of Paracelsus; so also
you will find many other rare Secrets of the Medical Art, not yet vulgarly
known to the World, attained to by much Labor, Pains, Care, and Industry, not
only of the Author, but also of several other Worthy and Learned Men, who were
persons of great Understanding, men of profound parts, Universal Scholars,
practically Experienced, Exemplars (...) Piety, and Professors of these Arts.

V. Many very simple Preparations, and mean Compositions you may also here
find; which for the poorness of the matter, at first sight may be slighted; but
in those low things by us so much commended, we have found sometimes much more
Power and Virtue than in many others of greater Name and Fame, which for their
numerous Ingredients, difficulty of Preparation and high prized Value, hay
made a great noise in the World.

VI. However the Book may be worth what you may give for it, if it be but for
the Preparation of the seven following things; viz. 1. Our Guttae Vitae, or
Cordial Drops. 2. Our Family Pills both with and without Aloes. 3. Our Royal
and Bezoartick stone. 4. Our Electuarium ad Tabidos. 5. Our Balsamum
Artificiale. 6. Our Regulata, or Ey-Water, than which, without doubt nothing is
more excellent of that kind. 7. Our Emplastrum Arthriticum, Or Gout Emplaster.

VII. The Compositions and Preporations of all these things, we have very
faithfully discovered; except one Ingredient in Our Guttae Vitae, wherein the
chief excellency of the whole Composition consists, and without which it has
not the quarter part of its Force and Virtues: this thing we thought good to
keep in Our own Breast for a season, yet so as we shall not be unwilling to
Communicate it to any Worthy and Ingenious person requesting it of us, of whom
we shall be persuaded the republic may be served, and the Author himself not
abused for such his good will, nor the Secret, be unseasonably divulged to
ungrateful and unworthy Minds.

VIII. To Conclude, (Lovers of Art) as I have begun, so I hope I shall continue
in this good Work (through the Assistance of the Divine help) till I have
happily rendered the whole Body of Physic, (complete in all its parts) in the
English Tongue; which I know no good Man can be Angery at: and as for evil Men,
as it is not my design or desire to please them, so Ivalue them not, their
Hateries or Detraction being of equal estimation with Me: Mean season, my
Advice to Thee is, That as Thou art a Lover of Art, in the first place, be a
Lover of God; who, as he is the only fountain of Wisdom, can only make Thee
truly Wise: keep a good Conscience in this untoward Generation; and whatsoever
Men may say of Thee, be sure to let Thy Words be few, and Thy Conversation
modest; and let Thy Actions bespeak Thee Just and Honest, so will the Blessings
of him who dwelt in the Bush, descend upon Thee, and as a Wall of Fire,
surround and preserve Thee, (in spite of what Envy or Malice can do) till he
Adds to Thy future Happiness, a Crown of Eternal Glory.

Epilepsie, Palsy, Sciatica, and Ruptures in Children. Outwardly, it cleanses
and heals old stinking and corrupt Ulcers, which are hard to heal. In the
Dropsy it is a Specific given in Rhenish Wine, j at a time. It is called
Bonus genius, Stataria, Foeniculus Porcinus, Horestrange, Sow-fennel, and

(...), Prunum Sylvestre, Bullies; which is, for the most part, taken also for
Sloes, whose proper name in Latin is Prunelum. Of the wild Plum or Sloe, is
made the counterfeit Acacia, in my opinion no ways inferior to the true. The
Flowers purge the Reins, help the Heaviness of the Heart, loosen the Belly, and
Cure the Pleuriesi. Upon the Black Thorn also grows a Moss, which cures
Ruptures. Schroder says, that the Sloe tree or black Thorn, becomes a
Garden-fruit by good ordering, and the Fruit will be much larger. See our
Pharm. lib. 1. cap. 4. Sect. 536, and 537. cap. 5. Sect. 56. and cap. 6. Sect.
77.

called Ranunculus Illyricus, or Apium Risus, which is said to kill; for, being
taken inwardly, it spoils the Senses and Understanding; and draws the Sinews of
the Face so together, that they do seem to laugh; and so without present

digest in a warm B.M. for six weeks; then put a quarter of the Infusion, with a
quarter part of the Wood, into a Vesica, and power on more Rain or River water,
till it is within six Inches of the Brim. Cover it with a Head, and fix to it a
large Recipient; and give a gradual convenient Fire, until the water in droping
appears to have no more of Oil in it. The Recipient ought to be large, because
the Oil which falls in the end would be lost, if new Recipients should be
applied. This is also to be noted, that Oils of Aromatic Woods do distill
somewhat warm, which is quite contrary to the distilling of inflamable and
violatile Spirits; for Oils must be separated from their bodies by a strong
Ebulition and heat, raising it with the Aqueous Vapors; but the heat must again
be temperated, lest the Phlegm should ascend too largely. Whereas, in Spirits
the water above the worm must be kept very cool, and when it grows too hot, the
cold ought to be renewed; but not so in the distillation of these oils. You
must separate the Water from the Oil according to Art. They both of them have
the virtue of the Wood, and are powerful against the Stone, and to cleanse the
Kidneys.

CHAP. II. Of Secondary Alteratives.
1. ACetum, Vinegar. 1. A strong Water out of the Lees of Vinegar. Faeces or
Lees of Vinegar, distill in a Vesicatory, with it is Refrigeratory, so will you

separating the Oil and Spirit from the Water.

2. Ammoniacum. 1. It is an admirable thing in Pains of the Spleen and the
Gout, and to dissolve hard Swellings. 2. Out of the Gum you may make a Resinous
Extract, which has the Virtues of the Gum exalted.

3. Gum Animi. 1. This Gum by dissolution, in S. V. rectified, makes an
incomparable white and clear Varnish; which besides it is use for Varnishing,
has all the Virtues of the Gum. 2. Dissolved in Oil Olive, it becomes an
excellent Balsam for the Sinews and Joints. 3. Dissolved in rectified Oil of
Turpentine, it yet makes a better Varnish.

is Liquor of Myrrh. It takes away Morphew, Scurf, as also Spots and Scars
contracted by the French Pox. 2. A Perfume of Benjamin. Dissolve pure Benjamin
in Oil of Nuts, chiefly, of Cherrie Kernels; to which, add Ambergrise, Musk,
and Civit; after six months strain it off; it is an excellent Perfume for
Gloves.

7. Camphir. 1. A Fucus for Ladies Faccs. Simple Oil of Camphir, distilled with
Bole; put into it fine Talcum in powder, digest in B. M. two or three days, or
a Week, so will it grow white, and be an admirable Fucus. 2. Oleum Camphorae
Johannis Caspari. Camphir p 1. Bole p 2. powder, and distill in a Retort, in
Sand, so will the Camphir come forth like Butter. Take of this p.j. Tartar
calcined pij. S. V. enough to overtop it 3 Inches. Digest in B.M. till the
Camphir begins to ascend, then abate the Fire, and decant the S. V. that
distilled forth, into a strait mouthed Glass; add Water, and the S.V. will be
white, the Oil of Camphyr swimming at top, which separate. To the matter left
in the Still, add more S.V. distill again, and separate as before; this work
repeat, till no more Camphir will ascend; so have you Oil of Camphir very
strong, but in a small Quantity, about an eighth part; the S. V. rectify for
other uses. 3. Another Oil of Camphir. Camphir viij. Salt j. Salt of Tartar
ijss. Powder, and make a kind of Cataplasm with Milk; digest three days in
Sand, then add Canary xij. distill by a low Alembick with a close Receiver, and

cures all sorts of Wounds at once dressing.

9. Copal. You may make an Oil from it, as from Gum Animi, and Colophony, which
is excellent for the Cure of green wounds. There was a Liquor which came from
the West Indies, called Oil of Copalyra, which Clusius supposes to be from
this Rosin.

10. Elemi. It yields an Oil by a Retort, which is a Specific in Gouts,
Palsies, and Convulsions.

11. Fuligo, Soot. It cleanses and cures the Suffocation of the Womb, the Salt

12. Galbanum. 1. Oleum de Galbano Clossaei. Dissolve Galbanum in Vinegar, and
make a blew Oil from an Iron Kettle, laid on one side, and a Retort upon a
Trivet of Earth, then cover it with a Cover, having a hole in it, that so the
degrees of Fire being kept, the Spirit may first come forth, then the Oil;
lastly, a Balsam. They have the virtue of the Gum, but the Oil and Balsom are
more powerful. 2. Compound Balsam of Galbanum. Purified Galbanum, dissolve it
in Oil of Turpentine, then with Rosin and Wax a. q. s. make a Balsom. It
dissolves hard Nodes, eases Pains of the Gout, and cures all sorts of green
Wounds, in a very short time.

13. Labdanum. Although it be flamable, yet it will not (as Schroder says) be
dissolved with Fats. The Arabian is the cheaper, and is brought to us in an
uniform mass. It is a good thing in the Toothache and Stomach pains, being
boiled in Wine and used. Outwardly, is said to be excellent against falling of
the Hair.

14. Lacca, Gum Lac. It is made of the Juice of a certain Tree in Pegu and
Malavar; yet some say it is made by the winged Pismires, being a Juice that is
sucked by them, which turns to Lacca, as Honey in Bees; this, they leave upon
Boughs, with which it is brought to us. But there is two sorts, the former is
vulgar Lacca, the latter is the true, which others think rather grows or sweats
out of the Boughs. It is prepared or washed in the Decoction of Birthwort and
Schaenanth, till it is clear, then gathering what settles.

15. Mastiche, (...), Mastich, Rosin of the Lentisk tree. 1. Oil of Mastick,
with S. V. Mastich lbjj. Bole in powder M iij. S. V. enough to make a Paste;
digest 14 days, then distill by a Retort in an open Fire, so will you have a
light Oil at the top, and a heavy at bottom, rectify both with Bole and Salt;
the one you may call Oil, the other Balsam. The Oil is good in all Weaknesses
and Crudities of the Stomach and the Cholick; the Balsom in green wounds. 2.
Simple Balsam of Mastich, It is made by boiling the Gum in Oil of Roses
Omphacine. It is a good Healer and incarnative. 3. According to Clossaeus, it
yields Oil alone in Plenty: and if you rectify it upon Vitriol, it will be
sharp; and adding water by B. M. it will be yellow.

16. Myrrh. 1. To depurate it. Powder it grossly, digest it in Wine three
Inches above the Powder, by a gentle B. M. being dissolved, strain while hot,
and inspissate. 2. Oil of Myrrh, with S. V. Liquor of Myrrh, put to it S. V.
digest, and distill by an Alembick. 3. Oil of Myrrh with Vinegar. Mix the
powder of Myrrh with Vinegar, digest, and then distill. These Oils have the
Virtue of the Myrrh.

17. Terebinthina. To make the blew Oil of Turpentine. It is made by laying the
fat Fir tree roots sliced, and flowers of Camomile Stratum super Stratum, in a
Copper Kettle or Vesica, in Water, fermenting some days, till the Turpentine
which is in the Fir, has drawn a Tincture from the Copper, which it carries
with it through the Alembick. Thurnheuser commends it as an incomperable
Vulnerary.

18. Tacamahacca. It is a most admirable Gum against all Pains and Tumors,
Nodes, and such like. Schroder says, that he has seen old Aches of the Thighs,
cured by a Plaster made of this Gum; I suppose he means the Sciatica.

19. Vinum, Wine. Magistery, or vegetable Stone of Wine. Putrify Sack for the
Space of forty days in a horsedunghill; distill in B. M. so have you first a
Spirit, then an Oil: separate them; after deflegmate the Spirit, and putrify
the Oil for forty days in a Horse dunghill; from the Faces with the Phlegm make
a volatile Salt without Calcination. Then purisie both together, impregnate the
Salt with it is Spirit, and digest it; after add the Oil, and then digest till
you have a red powder only. A few Grains (or Drops, if it be liquid) will make
a quart of Water have a Winish Property.

CHAP. III. Of Purgatives.
Choler Purgers mild.
1. CAssia Fistularis. It is hurtful to a moist Slippery Belly and Stomach, and
is windy; it is corrected with a Grain or two of Pepper, Anniseed or Cinnamon,
and is given in a Bolus, a vj ad ij. to Children ij.

2. Tamarinds, or Indian Dates. They are good for hot Constitutions, and
because of their Coldness, are corrected with Cinnamon and Mace: they purge
Slowly, but are quickened with Whey of Goats milk. Dose in Pulp, ab j. ad ij. or
iij; and in Infusion to v.

3. Manna Calabrina, 1. It is said to be of two kinds. 1. Liquid, which are our
ordinary Honey dews. 2. Solid, which is that which we intend here, and is only
to be had in the Shops. It is only gathered off of the Leaves and Boughs of the
common Ash, called Fraxinus, and of the wild Ash, called Ornus, but off no
other whatsoever. 2. This is the Opinion of Alcomarus and Donzellus, both
Italian Physicians, and of many other Eyewitnesses, who testify, that Manna
is a Juice or Gum, which distills from the Ash-tree, condensed by the heat of
the Air, and that it ought to be ranked in the number of Gums, which distill
from Trees, dissolving with Moisture, and coagulating with Heat, being far
different from Arabian Manna, which is only a dew that melts with heat. 3.
Baptist a Ferrarius a Physician of Calabria, whence that comes, which we daily
make use of, says, That there are three sorts of Manna's in Calabria, one from
the body of the Tree, another from the Boughs, which is forced; and another
from the Leaves; being no Dews, but a Juice distillled from the Fraxini, and
Orni, gathered in a hot settled Season, when no Rain falls. 4. It begins to
distill when enters from the body of the Tree; this, if it comes forth
voluntarily, is a white, clear, and chrystaline humor; which is gathered, and
carefully dried in the Sun; this flows about six Weeks. 5. The second begins to
distill when the former ceases, which is about the beginning of August, the
boughs and body of the Tree being wounded through the Bark with very sharp
Instruments: the Manna slows from these Wounds from Noon till ten a clock at
Night; this runs to the bottom of the Tree, like little sticks of Wax, and is
gathered the next day: This is not so much esteemed as the former, being
yellower or browner, yet full as much purgative. 6. The third, from the Leaves,
flows voluntarily, like little drops of Water, being, as it were, a kind of
sweat upon the nervous part of the Leaf, during the heat of the day, and
extends it self all over the Leaf: These Drops harden and become white in the
Sun, being something bigger than grains of Wheat. In August, the great Leaves
of the Ash will be so laden with these drops, as if they were covered with
Snow; it is as good as either of the former, yet less gathered, because of the
Trouble of separating it from the Leaves. See Mr. Ray of the Royal Society of
London, his Catalogue of English Plants, where these things are confirmed. 6.
Manna tartarized. It is made of Manna dissolved, and cleansed, and cast into
Tablets, adding to every ounce of Manna, one dram of Cremor Tartari. It has the
Virtues of the simple Manna, but purges better than it. 7. Spirit of Manna,
Dissolve it in a large quantity of fair Water, which, ferment; keep it till it
has a little vinous Acidity, then distill the Spirit, as spirit of Wine. This
Spirit will be better if in the Dissolution of the Manna, you add to every lbxx
of Manna v of Salt of Tartar. It is a great Cordial and Sudorifick, excellent
in malign or pestilential Fevers. 8. Water of Manna. Take Manna, distill it with
a gentle Fire, so will you have an incipid Water. The Virtues are the same with
the former, dose ab j ad ij; with this is made the yellow Tincture of Sulphur.
9. Spirit of Manna with May Dew. Dissolve Manna in May Dew, and cohobate till
it sublimes to the head of the Alembick like Snow; so the Mercury being brought
to the fluid nature of a Spirit, becomes a Solutive for the mineral of Gold,
without any corrosive force or Operation. 10. Crude Manna. It is safe in all
cases, excepting burning Fevers. It is quickened with Syrup of Roses solutive;
give it in Prune broth, or broth of a Cock or Hen, to the quantity of iij or
iiij.

4. Aloe Succotrina. Taken in too great a quantity, it inflames the Liver; and
because it opens the Orifices of the Veins, it is not safe for Women with
Child, and is hurtful for hot and dry Constitutions. It Is commonly impregnated
with Juice of Damask Roses, and corrected with Mastich. Dose a ss to j. and
more.

5. Rhubarb, the Soul of the Liver; It is not given alone, because it is apt to
sum, and easily exhales, but with Endive water, or Syrup of Roses solutive; it
ought not to be given to such as are subject to the Strangury or Hemorrhoids:
It is corrected with Cinnamon, Spicknard and Schenanth. Dose a j to ij. This
Root is called in general, (...), Rha, Rheon, Rheu, Raved, Ravet, Racoma,
Rhecoma. That which grows in Pontus, and about the Bosphorus is called (...),
Rha Ponticon, Pontick Rhubarb. That which comes from China, is called Rha
Chinarum, Rha Indicum, Indian Rhubarb. The best Rhubarb is the Indian, or that
which comes from China. The best next, is that which comes from Barbary which
is the Common. And that which is of least Virtue, is the Rha Ponticum, or that
which comes from Pontus. But there is another fort of Rhubarb, which grows in
Our Country, viz. (...), Thalietrum, Rhabarbarum monachorum, Garden Patience;
Dock, or Monks Rhubarb. See it in our Pharm. lib. 1. cap. 1. Sect. 119. and
cap. 4. Sect. 564. of the same Book.

6. Damask Roses, musked, fragrant, bitter and detergent. Their Virtues are
increased if their Juice be mixed with double quantity of Whey, and aromatized
with Spike and Cinnamon.

7. Violets. They are of like Virtue with Roses, exceeding good against the
Headache, and in most diseases of the head.

8. Turpentine, chiefly Venice, if made into a Bole with powder of Liquorice or
Elecampane, and Sugar, it cleanses and heals the Stomach, Lungs, and Reins: The
white potion made of it with the Yolk of an Egg, and Plantane water, is
excellent to strengthen, and cleanse both.

9. Syrup of Roses solutive. It is hurtful to Women with Child, because it
opens the Veins of the Womb, being given ab ij ad iiij.

10. Syrup of manna laxative. It is excellent to purge Children with.

11. Electuary of Hiera. It is an admirable Purger of sharp and choleric
Humors from the very extreme parts. Dose a j ad ss, Hitherto of such Choler
purgers as are mild; these following are stronger.

12. Asarum. If it be long boiled it loses it is Strength, the Infusion is best
in a proper menstruum: beaten to a fine powder it is emetick, and may be given
with Whey, Wine, and Honey, soden together.

13. Scammony. It ought not to be given to such as are weak and feverish,
because it is Acrimony inflames the Spirits, and disturbs the Boby. You may give
it alone in Broth; that which is corrected is called Diagrydium. Dose a gr. vj.
ad xvj. It is called in Greek, (...), Scammonium.

14. Pilulae Rudii. It is not only an excellent Purger of Choler, but an
universal Purge, for all Times, Ages, Sexes, and Constitutions. Dose ad j or ss.

15. Pilulae Aureae. They are of the nature of the former, and more in use.

Phlegmagogues mild.

used fresh and new gathered. That which grows on over-old Oaks, by it is over
much humidity, subverts the Stomach,

34. Sena, It is one of the best of Melanagogues in Nature; it draws Humors
out of the Stomach, Spleen, and Mesentery, and from remote parts; it is given
in Broth of Prunes, or of Raisins. or in Whey, or by Infusion in proper Water,
or in Spirit of Wine. The Cods if gathered before they are ripe, whilst full of

CHAP. IV. Of the Temperament of Medicines.
1. ALL Medicines simply considered in themselves, are either, hot, cold,
moist, dry, or temperate.

The Qualities of medicines are considered in respect of us, not of themselves;
for those Simples are called hot which heat our Bodies, those cold, which cool
them; and those temperate, which work no change at all in us, in respect of
either Heat, Coldness, Dryness, or Moisture. And these may be temperate, as
being neither hot nor cold, yet may be moist or dry: or being neither moist nor
dry, yet may be hot or cold; or lastly, being neither hot, cold, moist, nor
dry.

2. In Temporature, there is no degree of difference. The differences of the
other Qualitics are divided into four degrees, beginning at Temperature: So
that a medicine may be said to be hot, cold, moist, or dry in the first,
second, third, or fourth degree^.

The use of Temperate medicines, is in such c^ses, (where there is no apparent
Excess of the first Qualities,) to preserve the body temperate, to conserve
Strength, and to repair decayed Nature. And note, that those medi^ines which we
call cold, are not so called, for that they are really cold in themselves; but
because the degree of their Heat, falls below the Heat of our Bodies: and so
only in respect of our Temperature are said to be cold, being otherwise in
themselves really hot; for without beat, there could be no Vegetation,
springing, nor Life.

3. Such as are h^t in the first degree, gently heat our Bodies, being cooled
by Nature or Accident, thereby cherishing the natural heat, when weak, and
restoring it when it is wanting.

Their use is, 1. To make the offending humors thin, that they may be expelled
by Sweat. 2. By outward Application, to abate Inflammations and Fevers, by
opening the peers of the Skin. 3. To help Concoction, and keep the Blood in
it is just Temperature.

4. Such as are hot in the second degree, as much exceed the first, as the
first exceed a Temperature, or our natural Heat.

Their use is to open the Pores, and take away Obstructions, by cutting tough
Humors through their own essential f^ree, when nature cannot.

5. Such as are hot in the third degree, are more powerful in heating, being
able to inslame the Body, and cause Fevers.

Their use is, to provoke Sweat extremely, and cut tough Humaurs, and therefore
all of them resist Malignity, Plague, Pestilence and Poison.

6. Such as are hot in the fourth degree, burn the Body, if outwardly applied.

Their use is, to cause Inflammations, raise Blisters, corrode the Skin, and
expel wind.

7. Such as are cold in the first degree, fall as much on the one side of
Temperature, as hot medicines do on the other.

Their use is, 1. To qualify the Heat of the Stomach, and cause Digestion. 2.
To abate the Heat in Fevers. 3. To refresh the Spirit almost suffocated.

8. Such as are cold in the second degree, are chiefly of use to abate
Inflammations.

9. Such as are cold in the third degree, are such as have a repercuslive force.

Their use is, 1. To drive back the matter, and stop Defluxions. 2. To make the
Humors thick. 3. To limit the Violence of Choler, repress Sweat, and keep the
Spirits from fainting.

10. Such as are cold in the fourth degree, are such as stupisie the Senses.

They are used, 1. In violent Pains. 2. In extreme Watchings, and the like
Cases, where Life is dispaired of.

11. Drying medicines consume the Humors, stop Fluxes, stiffen the parts, and
strengthen nature. But if the Humidity be exhausted already then these consume
the natural strength.

12. Such as are dry in the first degree, strengthen; in the second degree,
bind: In the third, stop Fluxes, but spoil the Nourishment, and bring
Consumptions; In the forth degree, dry up the radical moisture, which being
exhausted, the Body must needs perish.

13. Moist medicines are opposed to drying; they are Leoitive, and make
slippery.

These cannot as some say, exceed the second degree, because they say, heat
dries up the Humidity, and cold congeals it; but such are mistaken, for if the
cold or heat is not excessive, or the medicine be temperate, it may be humid to
the sourth degree.

14. Such as are moist in the first degree, ease coughing, and help the
Roughness of the Wind-wipe; in the second, losen the Belly; in the third and
fourth, make the whole Habit watery and phlegmatic, filling it with Dropsies,
Lethargies, and such like dull diseases.

15. Thus medicines alter according to temperature, whose active qualities are
heat and cold, and whose passive are Dryness and Moisture.

16. The Active qualities eradicate diseases. The passive are subservient to
Nature.

So hot medieines may cure the Dropsy, by opening Obstructions; and the same
may cure the yellow Jaundice by it is attractive quality, in sympathizing with
the Humor abounding: cold medicines may compress or abate a Fever, by
condensing the hot Vapors; and the same may stop any flux, by it is congealing
power; dryness or moistness, all this time, only assisting of Nature. Thus much
of Temperaments in general.

CHAP. VI. Of the Appropriation of Medicines.
1. CEphalicks, are such medicines as are appropriatrd to the Head, and help
against such Diseases as it is subject to.

1. Cephalicks are some hot, some cold, and so manifestly alter the disposition
of the Head; or else, by an occult property, in changing the disposition of the
mind, by their sweet Scent, pleasing Harmony, delightful Signature, or
excellent Taste. 2. They are known (most of them) from their Signatures, from
their Warming, cleansing, cutting, and drying; and from their thin, subtle,
volatile and spiritual Substance and Property. 3. Cooling Cephalicks are used
in watchings and headaches; heating Cephalicks, in Dullness, Heaviness, and
Sleepiness. 4. If the Brain be afflicted, before you strengthen it, purge and
cleanse it; and when you purge it, let it be done with Cephalicks: but first be
sure to purge and cleanse the whole body, lest the head be soon filled with
Vapors again. 5. In purging and cleansing of the Brain, Cephalic Pills, and
other purging Medicines, are commonly used; but these are not the best things.
God and Nature have ordained another way of purging the head and brain, which
is, by the Nostrils. In this case, solid Errhines are best, and of great power
and force to cleanse and bring away all Impurities: These, ten or twelve times
used, will cleanse the Brain, and bring away more filth and corruption, than
ten thousand Internal Purges given in Pills, Potion, or what other form you
please. 6. The Brain and Head being purged by these solid Errhines not only
much relieves the head, eases headaches, takes away Dullness and Drowsiness,
etc. but it is of excellent use in all Distempers of the Eyes, Ears, Throat,
Amygdala's, etc. in all Strumous or Scrophulous Tumors of the Neck, defluxions
of Humors, Rhumatisms, etc. by drawing a vast Flux of matter from all those
parts by the Nostrils. 7. Under the name of the Head are contained the Eyes,
Ears, Nose, Pallet and Teeth; and most things (if not all) which respect the
Brain, respect them also. 8. In Externals, apply not to the Eyes, things too
hot, sharp, hard, biting, nor viscous; nor yet things oily. To the Nose apply
not things stinking, because they hurt the brain. 9. The Palate requires
things grateful, because otherwise the Stomach would be subverted. The Ears
require warming and drying medicines, because they are cold and dry in
Substance. 10. The Teeth are soon hurt with sour, sharp, and austere things,
because they are not covered with either Flesh o^ Skin to defend them. They
require things cleansing and binding; sweet and fat things rot them.

2. Pectorals, Are such as are appropriated to the Breast and Lungs, and these
either regard the parts afflicted, or the matter afflicting.

1. In ulcerated Lungs, things glutinative and binding are used, which are
naturally enemies to the Lungs because they hinder respiration and cleansing;
but Lenitives are most proper, because they open and remove the matter which
sticks, and cause free breathing, as also easy spitting. 2. In Distillations,
if the matter be so thin, that it cannot be expectorated, it must be made
thicker; if too thick, it must be cut, and made thinner. 3. Those things which
make thick, are cold by nature (as Poppies, Opium, etc.) Those which make thin
are hot, (as Bawm, Coltsfoot, etc.) But such are natural Pectorals, whose
essential Properties, are to strengthen the Breast and Lungs.

3. Cordials are such medicines as are appropriated to the Heart; and these, by
a singular Property, cheer, comfort, and revive the Spirits.

1. The heart is afflicted, either by too much heat, by Vapors, or by Poison:
and therefore such things as cool the heat of Fevers, strengthen the heart, and
resist poison, are Cordials. 2. Yet are not all cold things cordial; for
Henbane is cold, as well as Coral or Pearls, yet not a Cordial as they are. 3.
And of Counter Poisons, some strengthen the heart against Poison; others by
Antipathy oppose it. 4. Such things as strengthen it, do it either by
Similitude or by Attraction, which is a forceable drawing away of what offends.

4. Orecticks or Stomachicals, are Medicines appropriated to the Ventrical or
Stomach, which by a pleasing Sharpness, contract it, and by a grateful Taste
delight it.

1. Their use is, first in lost Appetite; secondly, in Concoction weakened:
thirdly, in the Retentive Faculty destroyed. 2. The first is cured by cleansing
and acid things: the second by Aromatical, heating, and strengthening things:
the third (from whence comes belchings, Vomitings, etc.) by Astringent
Medicines. 3. The first ought to be given after due cleansing of the Stomach;
the second before meat, for so the Concoction is best helped: the third against
Vomiting, after meat.

5. Hepaticals are such Medicines as are dedicated to the Liver, to open
Obstructions, to strengthen it, and to correct it is Vices.

1. Such things delight and strengthen the Liver, as are sweet, and do gently
bind: (but because the Liver is most subject to Obstructions, have a care of
great Binders.) 2. Such things correct it is Vices, as either hinder
Obstructions, or open them; and these are such as cut, attenuate, and cleanse,
with a gentle heat. 3. But if after Obstruction, there be Inflammation, you must
use cooling Hepaticks. Here then beware, that you hurt not the concoctive
Faculty, or so cool the Diaphragma, as to hinder breathing.

6. Spleneticals, Are such things as are appropriated to the Spleen, the Seat
(as some suppose) of Melancholy.

1. And these are such as are appropriated to Atrabilis or Melancholy; and do
remove Obstructions of the Spleen, arising from that humor. 2. This is done,
first by cordial, cooling, and moistning medicines. Secondly, by opening and
cutting Medicines, which differ from Hepaticks in this, that these are more
loosing, those more binding, by Sect. 5. 1.

7. Nephriticks or Renals. are such medicines as are dedicated to the Reins and
Bladder, remedying their Vices.

1. The Urine is stopped by Stones, Humors, or Inflammations, and therefore,
those Medicines, 1. Either break the Stone, 2. Or cut gross Humors. 3. Or cool
and cleanse. 2. Binding things in these Cases are dangerous, because they stop
Urine; and therefore those are only proper, which are Lenitive, cut and
extenuate, without violent Heat.

8. Hystericals are such things as are appropriated to the Womb, and these are
most of them Cephalicks.

1. These are known chiefly by their Scent; for sweet scents draw the Womb that
way they are applied; stinking Scents the contrary. 2. The Reason is, because
it sympathizeth with the head and Brain, from whence the nervous parts take
their beginning. 3. And therefore those are said to be Hystericals, which (as
well as by their intrinsic Virtue) have a power or force in their Scent, to
repress Vapors and fits of the Mother.

9. Arthriticals are such Medicines as are appropriated to the Joints, having a
drying, heating, and gentlt binding quality.

1. Their use is either in easing of Pains, or strengthening the part that is
weakened. 2. Pain is either taken away (by taking away it is cause) or assuaged.
3. It is assuaged by Anodyns, when the Symptons are so great, as to cause
Fluxion, Inflammations or Fevers. 4. If you respect the part, use Anodyns; if
the pain Narcoticks. 5. If by the pain there be an Influxion, it is a Sign the
matter proceeds of Blood or Phlegm. 6. Such things as take away the Cause, are
strong Cephalic Drawers and Cutters. 7. After the Pain is ceased, and the
cause taken away, apply Astringents, not only to strengthen the parts lately
weakened, but also to hinder future Defluxions.

CHAP. IX. Of the Properties of Medicines.
1. EMollient Medicaments are such, as soften and resolve an hardness to an
equal Temperature. Or thus, An Emollient is that which by Heat and Moisture,
warms what is frigid and congealed, and moistens it is dryness.

1. Cold thickens the Humors, and Dryness hardens them, and this in a Tumor
requires an Emollient. 2. Their use is, first in melancholic Tumors; where, if
the Humor be complicate, so must the Medicine be; and if the Humor be very
tough, the Medicine must be the hotter. Secondly, in softning hard places.
Thirdly, in Sinews shrunk. 3. And these are known, First, by Taste, as being
sweetish or incipid, fat and oily. Secondly, by feeling, as being smooth and
Slippery.

2. Relaxers, Are such as l^osen any member contracted, or through Cold,
Dryness, or Repletion of Wind, Humors, or other matter; and they are a little
hot, and very moist.

1. This property of stretching, properly belongs to the musculous and nervous
parts of the body, to which, Relaxers are generally applied; and therefore,
less heat and more moisture, is required. 2. Their use is chiefly in
Convulsions, Cramps, and such like Diseases.

3. Rarifying Medicines are such, as being of thin and subtle parts, make tough
and thick Humors thin and rare, and so fit them for Expulsion, being only so
hot, as neither to draw matter together, nor yet to discuss it being gathered.

1. Their use is, to open the pores of the Skin, make matter thin, and so ease
pain. 2. Their Anodine property appears from this, for that in Tumors, it is
not only plenty of Humors. which causes the pain, but a certain dryness,
hardness, and stretching of the Skin, which these medicines remedy by their
emollient and relaxing Property. 3. To these are opposed Medicaments, making
thick, which have opposite qualities: these are cold, moist, and viscous, such
as stop the pores of the Skin.

4. Aperitives are such as (being of thin parts, and biting) open the mouths of
the Vessels, warming and comforting of them.

1. Their use is, chiefly in Mouths of the Vessels in the Stomach, in the
Aspera Arteria, and other Vessels dedicated to the Lungs, and also to ease the
violence of Coughing. 2. They are known by Taste, being sharp and piercing,
biting the Tongue like pepper.

5. Attenuating Medicines are such as by a gentle cutting quality, loosen the
Bowels, and open Obstructions there.

1. The Bowels being obstructed by thick, tough, and viscous Humors require
Medicines of a thin cutting Substance, being either hot or hold. 2. Their use
is, first, to open the Bowels; secondly, to cleanse the Breast of Phlegm.
Thirdly, to expel the Terms. 3. Let them be used after some gentle Purge: They
are generally in Taste sharp, sour, or bitter, dilating the tongue and not
contracting of it; and may properly be called Inciders.

6. Astringents are such at by their Sharpness and Roughness, contract, dry up,
and bind the places where they come.

1. They are all dry by Nature, being either hot as Cinnamon, or cold as Alum,
Opium; they are known by their contracting the tongue, and are generally
opposed to loosening, or lenitive Medicines. 2. Their use is, first to make the
Humors thick; secondly, to hinder Defluxions: Thirdly, to stop Fluxes of the
belly: Fourthly, to contract the pores of the Skin: Fifthly, to stanch bleeding.

7. Attractives are such as by their heat and thinness, draw Humors, or matter
to any part of the body desired.

1. And these do it either by natural Heat, as Onions, Leeks, Garlic, Briony,
Spurge, Nettles, Aron, Euphorbium, Dittany, Mustard, Pyrethrum, Crowfoot,
Cantharides, Oils of Turpentine, Bricks, Bays, Castoreum, etc. 2. Or by
Putrefaction, as Leven, Pigeons, Hens, and Goats Dung, and all other
Excrements. 3. Or by Sympathy, as all Purges and Vomits, Viseus Quereinus,
Peony, Amber, Load stone, etc. 4. Their use is, First, Inwardly, to take away
corrupt Humors out of the body, and to expel Poison. Secondly, Outwardly to
draw out Poison, Fire, or the offending matter. from the Internal to the
External parts. Thirdly, to warm parts over much cooled, and to help forward
the Crisis.

8. Repercussives, Repulsives, or Repellers, Are such as by a cold Quality
(being astringent also) drive back the matter or humor to some other place.

1. And so these are opposed to Attractives, as whites of Eggs, Horse-tail,
Roses, Purslane, Lettice, Nightshade, Housleek, Melons, Cucumers, Ducks-meat,
Quinces, Balaustians, Pomgranate peels, Poppy, Opium, dried Toads, the Popular
Ointment, Mercurial Ointments. 2. Their use is, chiefly, first to stay
Influxions, and repel Vapors. Secondly, to help Inflammations, hot Tumors,
Headaches, and the like. 3. They may be best used in the beginning,
Discussives in the latter end. 4. But if the matter be venomous or pain be
great, take heed of Repulsives, or forbear them till due purging. 5. Take heed
also, lest you too much contract the Pores with them.

9. Discussives are such as generally disperse the matter, and so dissolve it
by insensible Transpiration.

1. Their uses are chiefly External; first, in opening the Pores, and making
the matter thin. Secondly, to dissolve Tumors. 2. These Medicines the Greeks
call Diaphoretica, more because they make the matter perspire through the
Pores, than that they are considered as Sudorificks: but being inwardly given,
their chief Intention is to cause Sweat. 3. These Medicaments have adjoined
with them a power also of attracting, but they generally expel, or bring out
only serous thin Humors and Vapors; not Blood nor gross Humors, which are only
evacuated by Phlebotomy and purging. 4. But in Tumors, they ought to be used
with caution, lest by drawing away the thin parts the thick being left behind,
the Swelling should grow so hard, as to become past all the hopes of cure; in
this case, mix Emollients with your Discussives.

10. Cleansing Medicines are such as by a drawing quality, have power to take
away the Sanies, Filth, or Matter of Wounds or Ulcers, and make them clean.

1. In a putrified Sore, it is necessary to cleanse it before it can be healed;
and those Medicines do it by a certain kind of Roughness, Sharpness, or nitrous
quality. 2. They are hot, cold, salt, sweet, bitter, nitrous, used in external
Applications, as Purges are in internal Exhibitions. 3. As their use is to
cleanse the Sanies and filth of Wounds and Ulcers; so also ought they to be
used after general Prescriptions and Evacuations; the pain of the Ulcer being
first eased, the Quittor ripened, the flux of humors stopped, and the
Inflammation abated; otherwise, the Cure will never go on successfully.

11. Anodynes are such as by a gentle warming, or temperate quality, and soft
substance, ease and take away pain; with having some small regard to the cause,
and entering into the part by their Tenuity.

1. These are generally hot, and so abate the pain and heat of Inflammations, by
opening the pores, and letting those hot Vapors out. 2. Yet ought they not to
be too hot, lest, instead of easing the pain, they should inflame. It will be
good to choose such as are of a moderate Temperature, and of a thin Essence. 3.
And the reason is yet farther apparent, that they ought not to vary much from
Temperature, because they are to be applied both to hot and cold effects. 4. In
cold effects they ease pain, by opening the pores, penetrating, and warming: In
hot diseases they ease the pain by opening the Pores, by which, the hot,
fuliginous Vapors being let out, the part is cooled.

12. Narcoticks or Hypnoticks, ( improperly called Anodyns also) are such
things as by reason of their exceeding cold quality, case pain by Stupefaction,
or dulling the Senses.

1. These some think take not away pain at all, but only stupifie the Senses,
that you cannot feel it. 2. They are mostly used, when the Symptoms appear more
dangerous than the Disease: but in the beginning and height of Fevers, beware
of them inwardly, unless prepared with a sharp or nitrous Spirit. 3. If the
pain be in the Skin, let the Anodyn or Narcotick be liquid; but the deeper it
lies, the more solid, lest their virtue should be lost, before the work is done.

13. Carminatives are such as by a heating, rare, and anodyn quality expel
Wind.

1. Their chief use is in the Cholick, Stone, Griping of the Guts, and the like
Diseases. 2. Wind is generally contained in some certain cavity, and that
either in the Bowels, or in the External parts, in Tumors. 3. But in what part
of the body soever it be, if it makes too great a distention, it causes pain;
the removing of which, must be by opening the Vessels or the Pores. 4. So that
Carminatives are said to contain in them a complex Operation: for they ease
pain by opening the stoppag^s, letting the extending matter out; this they do
by their Heat, Thinness, and specific property to those Intentions. 5. And
they comfort and heal the parts already hurt, by an Anodyn property, having a
Sympathy with the part hurt and pained.

4. Diaphoreticks, or Sudorificks, are such as provoke Sweat, and work by
insensible Transpiration.

1. Their use is to expel serous thin Humors, and filthy Vapors, lying in the
outward parts of the body, and near the Surface of the Skin. 2. But if there be
gross matter with all, (as in Tumors) there is danger; for by sweating, the
thin matter being transpired, nothing but an incurable hardness is left behind.
3. They are to be used generally in the declining of the Disease, unless in
Diseases proceeding from Blood, where they are used in their Increase and
State. 4. They are of a hot quality, and thin parts. 5. But some Authors make a
difference between Diaphoreticks and Sudorificks; which to me seems needless,
they are so near a kin. 6. The former, viz. Diaphoreticks, they call
Transpirers, which are such things as drive the Morbisick matter through the
Pores of the Skin invisibly, or by insensible Transpiration. 7. The Latter,
viz. Sudorisicks, which they also call Hydroticks, are such Medicaments as
drive out the morbisick matter by the habit of the body, in a sensible manner,
to wit, by sweat. 8. But to declare my own Opinion in a word, I think there is
no difference between them, but in degrees; Diaphoreticks being the weaker sort
of sweating Medicaments, Sudorificks the stronger.

15. Alexipharmacks, or Alexiteria, are such Medicines as resist Malignity and
Poison.

1. They are twofold, First, such as strengthen Nature against Poison.
Secondly, such as overcome it by a contrary quality. 2. If poisons kill by
their quality, let them be overcome by their contraries, as cold Poisons by hot
Antidotes; Corrosives by Lenitives, etc. 3. The best way is to do it speedily,
by Vomit, Purge, or Sweat; let vomiting be first, purging next, and sweating
last, according to the Time, Place, Nature and Motion of the Poison. 4. For, if
it be newly received, and in the Stomach, use vomiting. 5. If by longer time it
has infected the Blood, and Spirits, or it be the biting of a mad Dog, or other
venomou^ Beast, use sweating. 6. If the body be cacochymical or full of evil
humors, use purging. 7. Lastly, the Cure ended, strengthen the parts of late
afflicted.

16. Pyroticks are such medicines, as by their exceeding heat, burn, or scald
the Skin or Flesh, or both.

1. These ^re threefold; first, Catheretica, or Corrosives, which by excessive
drying, consume the Excrescences of the Flesh: Their use is in Ulcers, to eat
away dead Flesh. 2. Septica, or Putrefactives, which by their vehement heat
ulcerate the Skin, with very little pain: their use is to draw Blisters. 3.
Escarcotica, or Causticks, which consume all they come near: Their use is to
make Issues. 4. The first are strong, the second stronger, the third strongest.
5. They are also used in eating off of Hair, and then they are called
Psylothrons; as also in wasting hard and callous Tumors, consuming Warts,
Polypus, in Gouts, Lethargies, Fistula's, malignant Ulcers, defluxions of
Humors, violent Burning, malign and pestilential Fevers. 6. But beware lest
they inflame, or cause Convulsions, which you may prevent by purging the body
well first. 7. Take heed also, lest you inflame the parts adjacent, which you
may prevent by anointing the place round with Defensatives.

17. Suppuratives ( called in Greek Peptica) are such as by a natural heat,
bring Blood, raw, superfluous, and undigested humors, to Matter and Ripeness.

1. These by reason of their emplastick Body, close the Pores of the Skin; and
so by keeping the heat together, bring to Putrefaction and matter. 2. These
differ from Emollients in this, They make hard things soft; These draw, or
generate humors, and ripen them. 3. Their chief use is to ripen Plegmons, or
Tumors proceeding of Blood, and are generally applied in the height of the
Disease.

18. Sarcoticks, or Incarnatives, are such things as breed Flesh, changing the
blood there into.

1. These are generally hot in the first degree, and something drying; if they
be applied to a dry part of of the body, the Sarcotick must be very dry,
sometimes in the fourth degree. 2. And these prevent the Blood, that it may not
turn into Corruption while it turns into Flesh. 3. If they be applied to a soft
and tender place, let the Medicine be gentle, and not exceed the first degree,
unless the Ulcer be moist.

19. Glutinatives are such Medicines, as by their glewy quality, join the
mouths of Wounds or Ulcers together.

1. These the Greeks call Symphitica, and are generally dry in the second
degree, drying up, not only what flows out, but what remains liquid in the
Flesh. 2. They are to be used when the Ulcer is cleansed, and filled with
Flesh. 3. They are of a consistence either dry and earthy, or moist and watery,
but without any biting quality.

20. Cicatrizing or Scarrifying medicines, called in Greek Epulotica, are such
as by a drying and binding quality, cloth a raw place with Skin.

1. These are to be used after the Ulcer is cleansed, incarnated, and the lips
of it joined together. 2. They perform their work by consuming both that which
flows to, and that humor which is already in the Flesh, that it may be changed
into the property of Skin. 3. They are drying, that they may suck out the
humidity in the place; and binding, that they may stop a Flux of new matter, by
strengthening the part.

21. Emmenonagogicks are those medicines, which by a certain specific quality,
prevoke the Terms.

1. These medicines are generally of a hot nature, and thin essence, which have
a power to attenuate and rarifie the Blood, and to open the mouths of the
Vessels. 2. They are generally hot in the third degree, but not over drying, 3.
In the Exhibition of these Medicaments, you are to consider the Age and the
time. 4. As to the Age, they are rarely to be expected before 14 years old, and
they commonly leave the Woman about 50. 5. As to the Time, that you give the
medicine four or five days before the time of their flowing or coming down;
having a day or two before used universal Preparatives by proper Catharticks,
of which, the Tincture of Colocynthis in S. V. or it is decoction in water, or
infusion in Lime water, are excellent; so also Syrup of Roses solutive given to
iiij. Alocs Rosata, Elixir Proprietatis. 6. The retaining of the Terms, often
breeds Dropsies, Cachexies, Green Sickness, Fits of the Mother, Convulsions,
Falling Sickness, Blindness, and other cruel Diseases; and sometimes Madness it
self. 7. Always have in mind this verse, Luna vetus veteres; juvenes nova Luna
repurgat.

22. Diuretics are Medicines which are said to make a Separation of the Serum
from the Blood, and so to provoke Urine; or, such as provoke it by opening the
Vrinal Passages.

1. Such things as make a Separation of the Serum from the Blood, are the
things intended here, the other, which open more powerfully the Urinal
passages, you may see, Cap. 11. Sect. 26. and Cap. 12. Sect. 6. following. 2.
These are hot and dry, and are known by their taste, as being very biting, and
of an attenuating, cutting, and abstersive property, that they may alter, and
make more fluid, the thick, tenacious, and viscous Blood, whereby it may let go
it is Serum. 3. Those things of a nitrous Property, properly open the Urinal
Passages; of which, hereafter. 4. Beware of giving violent Diuretics, before
the passages be opened, lest, instead of curing, you kill the Sick, which in
this case often happens. For, strong Diuretics being given while the passages
are stopped, make the Obructions more obdurate, and sometimes incurable; and
then the water not having it is natural Passage, either falls into the Abdomen,
or regurgitates into the Veins, and then the sick dies of a Dropsy. 5. Give
also with and before them, a good quantity of Oil of sweet Almonds,

23. Traumaticks or Vulneraries, Are such Medicines as having a specific
Virtue to the Intention, are accommodated to the more facile, dextrous, or
speedy healing and curing of Wounds and Ulcers.

1. These Medicines ought to be used after a due purging, and cleansing of the
body, lest they being received in, be, by the habit of the body, turned to
Corruption also. 2. They ought to be given for a long time, viz. during the
whole Cure (after proper purging) that they by their Balsamic property, may
beget a habit of healing. 3. They ought to be conveyed in such a menstruum, as
may not be too strong, lest it inflames the wound, or endangers a Fever: and
likewise such as may have a good diuretic force, that if the sick should drink
freely of it, it may not endanger a Dropsy. 4 It ought to be grateful, that
the Stomach may receive it with pleasure, for thereby it is healing power is
more easily exerted and insinuated into the Universal Habit. 5. The Distinction
between Traumaticks and Vulneraries, may be said to be this; the former are
used internally, the latter externally: No Balsam that I know of, was ever
called Traumaticum, the latter is common.

24. Cosmeticks are such Medicines as beautify and adorn the Body.

1. These are applied either to the Skin, Hair, or Teeth. 2. Freckles,
Sunburning, and blackness of the Teeth, are to be taken away by cleansing
Medicines; redness of the Face, according to the Cause, as from heat of Blood
by internal Coolers; from external Accidents, by cooling and extenuating. 3.
Wrinkles are remedied by Lenitives and Emollients. 4. Falling of the Hair, by
correcting the Humor which causes it, and by gentle heating the part; too much
Hair by, cleansers and corrosives. 5. Smoothness of the hair by Dryers and
Binders, which cause it to curle. 6. Scurf and Dandriff is taken away by
Abstersives. 7. Looseness of Teeth, by things drying and binding.

CHAP. XI. The Kinds of purging Medicines.
1. PVrgation is a taking away of somewhat; or a convenient drawing out of
Humors, offending either in Quantity or Quality, or both; by Medicines proper
thereto.

2. It is sixfold, to wit, Cathartick, Emetick, Diuretic, Sudorifick,
Ptarmick, and Salivatick.

Of CATHARTICKS.
3. Cathartica, are such Medicines as work downwards, or purge out Humors by
stool.

4. These humors are either small in quantity, or they abound; or they cause a
Fever or no Fever: or, lastly, they wander through the whole body, with
vehement Symptoms.

5. They ought to be prepared, or made fit for Expulsion; such as are clammy,
being cut, and the thick to be attenuated; the Passages being made open and
free by Clisters, Suppositories, emollient Broths, and such like.

6. The Medicaments by which this Evacuation must be performed, are either
mild, which reach only the Interior parts; or strong, which penetrate beyond
the Liver, to the Exterior parts, and into the habit of the body. Again, they
are either particular, appropriated to some single humor, as Choler, Phlegm,
Melancholy, or Water; or Catholic and Universal, which purge all humors at
once.

7. Therefore, Consider the humor abounding, (See Our Synopsis Med. lib. 1.
cap. 44.45. and 46.) and the Medicaments proper to evacuate the same, and give
them; the contrary put the sick in danger.

8. Those which are appropriate to Choler are called Cholagoga; to Phlegm,
Phlegmagoga; to Melancholy, Melanagoga; to watery humors, Hydragoga; and to all
humors, Panchymagoga, or Holagoga.

9. The body ought to be first (before purging) prepared, as at Sect. 5. above,
as first by exciting natural heat, and strengthening of it: Secondly, by fitting
the Humors, as if tough and clammy, to prepare them with cutting Syrups, as
those of Sorrel, Wood Sorrel, Vinegar, Limons, Citrons, Honey of Squills, etc.
If thick, to make them thin. Thirdly, by opening the Passages by Clisters, etc.

10. The next thing you are to do, is (as well as to fit the purge to the
humors) to make it sympathize with the parts of the body afflicted. And so,

11. Agarick is truly appropriated to the Head: Cassia to the Breast and
Kidneys; Aloes to the Stomach and Guts; Rhubarb to the Liver; Sena to the
Spleen; Turpentine to the Reins; Iallop to the Throat and Bowels; Colocynthis
to the Brain; Scammony to the Womb, and extreme parts; Hermodacts to the
Joints; Mecoachan to the habit of the Body.

12. Let every Purge receive it is due correction, with things of thin parts,
which are odoriferous and carminative; as Pepper, Ginger, Cinnamon, Mace,
Nutmegs, Cloves, Spicknard, Aniseeds, Carroways, Schaenanth, Liquorice, Spirit
of Salt, Oils of Vitriol, or Sulphur, allayed with Water; lest that they should
over-turn the Stomach, and that Wind may be expelled: yet let not the Corrector
be in so great a quantity, as to move Urine.

13. If the purge be dull or slow in working, let it be quickened by addition of
some nimbler thing, as Cremor Tartari, Sal Gem. For since that purges act by
help of the expulsive Faculty, so as to disturb and jumble the whole mass of
Blood, and then to separate the humors (although their substance be partly in
the Veins) the nimbly and smoother they work, it is certainly so much the better.

14. The Conveniences of Purgation are now to be considered; viz. 1. Whether it
ought to be done, or no. 2. How much or often. 3. When. 4. After what manner.

15. If the Body is sound and well; or sick and dissolved, thin, or
consumptive; or is griped without Evacuation; or has an Apostem in the Guts; or
the parts you would purge rage with pain; or the Belly be bound, or Stomach
weak; or if the Sick purges only by the smell of Physic; or if there be a
paucity of Humors; or if the Midriff be extended, raised, burned, or inflamed,
and the Urine fiery; or the Belly is exceedingly bound: In any of these cases,
you may not purge, but rather give a Clyster.

16. But if there be Gripings without a Fever, heaviness of the Knees, and pain
in the Loins; or if the Sick be hard to vomit, and indifferently fleshy; or if
the matter conceived in the Member be moveable; or if nature does not incline
to a Crisis; or where the Conditions at Sect. 15. are absent: In all these
Cases you may purge.

17. How much, or often: Herein you must consider. 1. That you first use gentle
Purgations, rather than strong; a Dose rather too small than too great; and
purge more seldom than too often. 2. That the parts in the Region of the Belly
require Lenitives; the Vessels moderate Purgatives; the Habit of the Body,
strong ones. 3. That a strong Cacochymick Body be not purged too violently,
lest the Spirits be dissipated: the less the humors are, the stronger may be
the Cathartick. Weak Cacochymick bodies ought to have smaller Purgations, and
the remaining humors to be drained away by gentle repeated Lenitives. 4. If the
Strength languishes through Resolution, as in a Consumption, you must purge
gently and often; so also Women with Child, in the seventh month, lest, the
Child being heavy, by the strong working of the Medicament, it should be cast
downwards. 3. Old Persons, whose Age has consumed their Juyces; Children, who
by reason of their growth and rarity, easily evaporate their Humidity; Men of a
rare or thin Texture of Body; Lean Persons, and such as are Long Legged, who
because they have large Veins, are easily purged; Stammerers who are liable to
a Looseness; and such who have their Stomach only out of Frame: All these ought
to be purged with Gentle Catharticks, for they cannot bear strong Purgers, but
suffer Detriment thereby. 6. But such as live hardly, as Rusticks; Such as are
Melancholy, so made, either by Nature, Diet, or Sickness; or Such in whom
gentle Purgations will do nothing; or Such as have their bodies solid, and full
of Juice: All these require strong Purgations. 7. Lastly, Where great Plenty of
Humors are profoundly situate in the body, or where manifold Evacuations are
needful, you must use plentiful Purgations, either jointly or severally,
beginning with the more gentle first.

18. The Quando, or when you ought to purge. 1. Purge Women with Child, about
the middle of their Time, or when the Child begins to stir, (See our Synopsis,
lib. 3. cap. 13. Sect. 57.) and that when the humors are in Agitation: Women in
Childbed, are not to be purged till their Month be over, 2. In peracute
Difeases, if the matter be unruly and in Motion, you may purge the very same
day, because of the Tenuity and Fluxability of the matter. 3. In intermitting
Diseases, you may purge in the Intermission; by no means in the Paroxism. 4. In
Chronick Diseases, purge not before the matter is attenuated and made fluxile,
and the passages opened. 5. In Summer time, give the Purge by break of day, in
Winter time, by daylight; and let it be given two or three Hours before Meat.
6. Lastly, the Juyces which are in motion, or will suddenly be in Motion, are
forthwith to be evacuated, to prevent the Increase of the Disease.

19. The Modus, After what manner. 1. To every Humor, you must exhibit it is
proper Purgative, letting it as much as may be sympathize with the part
afflicted. 2. To the Bowels and near parts; or in melancholy cases, it is good
to use Medicines of a Liquid form; but if Melancholy simply abounds, the
Cathartick ought to be mixed with Lanitives and Moistners. 3. In purging the
remote parts, as the Head, Brain, Arms, Feet, Nerves, Joints let the form be
hard, as Pills Troches, etc. for they lie longer, to call the offending Humor.
4. Purgers that leave a binding quality behind them, are hurtful in evacuating
tough Phlegm or Melancholy, because they make the Humors harder, but in Choler
and putrid Phlegm, (from whence comes Defluxions and a Looseness) they are very
proper. 5. Of these kinds of binding Purgers, are Aloes, Rhubarb, Rhapontick,
Damask Roses, Wormwood, Myrabolans of all sorts, Prunes, Tamarinds, etc. All
which, (except the Aloes) are best given in Infusion; the Aloes, because of
it is bitterness, is best in the form of a Pill. 6. In Summer time, you ought to
give your Purges with cool things; but in Winter time, after Preparatives,
mixed with Attenuaters, because then the Humors are more difficult to move. 7.
Lenitives or gentle Purges, must be given a little before or after meat, lest
nature put it to a wrong use, by turning it into Nutriment; Strong Purgers,
three hours before meat; for about three hours after they work, the sick may
begin to eat: but in giving the strongest Purges, let the whole Operation be
over, before the Sick dines, or begins to eat any food; but if the Sick cannot
hold out, but during the Purgation, seems to be weakened, or is very hungry, let
him drink presently after the taking of his Medicament, a draught of Broth, or
Posset Drink, or thin Mace Ale. 8. Lastly, When the Evacuation is ended, (which
is known by the great Thirstiness of the Sick) let the broth of a Pullet be
given with Sugar, to wash the Guts.

20. The Accidents in pur ging. 1. Not working. If it works not at all, give
hot Broth, Posset drink, Pulp of Prunes, or an emollient Clyster, or all of
them. 2. Working too violently. In this case, you may give Barleywater, or
Broth, for that will cause that it shall work little or nothing, by reason of
it is restrictive Faculty; or, the Dissolution of Gum Tragacanth; or, Decoction
of Mallows; or, Oil of sweet Almonds; or, Syrup or Juice of Quinces, anointing
the Belly and Stomach with Oil of Roses; or, (if all the before said things do
no good) Laudanum, a gr. j. ad iij. or, if that fail, give a Vomit, to divert
the Course, and bring the matter upwards. 3. Voiding Blood. In this Case give a
Clyster of new Milk, Honey, and Oil; or, a Clyster only of Oil and Honey;
anointing the Fandament with Oil of Amber p. j. mixed with Oil of Almonds p.
ij. 4. Na^ seating or Loathing. It is taken away by a Linen Cloth dipped in
Vinegar, put upon the Cup; or, by drinking or washing the Mouth with Juice of
Pomgranates, both before and after the taking; or, by tasting a little Syrup of
Vinegar, or Limons, or Citrons, or Coral, or Mint; or, washing the Mouth with
Vinegar, and smelling to it. 5. Vomiting. It is stayed by Stomach Strengthers,
and the Medicaments at 4. Or, by Cupping-glasses, applied to the Navel; or, by
holding an Egg to the Throat; or putting toasted Bread to the Nostrils; or, by
smelling to an Onion; or, to Bread dipped in Vinegar. 6. Gripings. they are
mitigated by a Lenitive Clyster; or, exhibiting Carminatives by the Mouth; or,
a decoction of Mastich, with lukewarm water. 7. Convulsions. They are
remedied, by anointing with Balsamum Nervinum Schroderi, and taking inwardly,
Spiritus Diapente ad j. in generous Wine. 8. Lastly, to prevent the former, and
other ill Accidents, after the purge is taken, the sick must rest, that Nature
may embrace the Medicament; then use a little motion, to melt the humors, and
that the expulsive Faculty may be provoked. If the Medicament be strong, the
Patient may sleep a little after it; the contrary, if it be weak.

Of EMETICKS.
21. Emetica are such Medicines as purge or work upwards, and by Vomit. These
work more violently, and afflict the Body more than Catharticks.

22. The Humors ejected by Emeticks proceed from Choler, Phlegm, and Melancholy,
but those especially which reside in the Capacity of the Belly or Stomach, or
are contained in the Spleen, Hollow side of the Liver, or the Pancreas: as also
such which of their own accord, tend upwards, known by bitter Belchings, Pain,
Biting, and Heaviness of the Midriff. Therefore,

23. Let Emeticks be given; first, in all the aforenamed cases; secondly, in a
Cachectick, Scorbutic, and Cacochymick Disposition of the whole Body; for that
they draw from all parts.

24. Emetick Medicaments procure vomiting, either because they have an
Inclination upwards: or, because they do, as it were, float upon the Stomach,
and oppress the same: or, because they loosen the upper Orifice of the Stomach.

25. They ought not to be given to Women with Child: nor to Women subject to
Fits: or, to Persons in a Consumption, or that have an Ulcers in the Lungs: or,
that have a Suffusion: or, have a Weakness of Sight: or, to very old People:
or, to such as are hard to vomit.

26. But to persons of a Lean habit, such as are accustomed to, and easily
vomit, have a firm head, large Breast, nor spit Blood, they may safely be given.

27. Let Emeticks be given in Summer, because, then the Humors are carried
upwards, before meat, in thin and choleric persons; after meat, in phlegmatic
people.

28. If you vomit with Hellebor, be sure the body be free from a Fever, (lest
it cause a Convulsion) and let it be after long vomiting; let it be given in a
large dose ( ad ij. in powder, and ad j. in Extract) And if the Hiccup come
after taking of it, stop it, by giving Muld Sack, boiled with Rue.

29. Let the Vomit be so much lighter, by how much the Disease is the more
vehement: and so much the stronger, by how much the part to be cleansed, is far
situate in the body.

30. Let no Oil be used as a Vomit in Fevers, because of the Relaxation of the
Stomach, whose Strength (in those Diseases,) ought especially to be preserved.

31. Lastly, observe, that in giving Hellebor, a lesser dose than is fit,
agitates the Juyces, and disturbs nature to no purpose, for which reason, the
larger dose is so much the better, provided, that the Sick had used other
gentle vomiting for ten or twelve days before hand.

Of DIVRETICKS.
32. Diuretica are such Medicines, as purge downwards, and by Urine. Or,
Diuresis or Vrination, is the drawing of Humors out of the Body, by Medicines
provoking Urine.

33. They are given in Diseases of the Reins and Bladder; in Dropsies,
Scurvies, waterish Diseases of the Blood, Obstructions of the Urine by Gravel,
Stones, Slime, Matter, Stoppage of the Terms, Cachexia, Greek-sickness, etc.

34. They are also ducly administered in all such Diseases as are evacuated by
little and little; and where the Humors are thick and adust, and ought to be
made fluid.

35. But they ought not to be given to bodies full of ill humors, unless they
are first abated by Purgation; lest, by then Thickness and Plenty, while they
rush headlong into the narrow Passages, they should stop them, and so make the
Obstructions greater.

36. Neither are they to be given in dry Diseases, such as Consumption,
Madness, etc. nor where the Passages are either exulcerated or inflamed: Nor
ought they to be mixed with Perfumes, (if given to Women) lest they be drawn to
the Womb. See cap. 9. Sect. 22. aforegoing.

Of SVDORIFICKS.
37. Sudorifica are such M^dicines as purge by Expulsion and Sweat, through
opening the Pores of the Skin all over the Body.

38. They cause Sweat, by turning the Humors into Vapors, and thrusting them
outward.

39. All sorts of Sudorificks have a greater Tenuity or Subtilty of parts than
Diuretics have; and those which are hot, are more subtle than those which are
cold.

40. Hot Sudorificks, as they are more subtle, so they work by Rarefaction;
cold Sudorificks work by an occult quality, or by making the heat fly from the
Center to the Circumference.

This is apparent; for a man in a Sweat on a hot day, if he drinks cold water,
or small beer, will sweat the more; whereas, if he drunk Spirit of Wine, or
Strong Waters, they would cool him: for, as like cleaves to like, so every
unlike flys away.

41. They ought not to be given to Choleric people, because they sweat hardly:
nor when the humors lie in the Cavity of the Womb, Guts, or Stomach, etc. and
not in the habit of the Body: nor if the body be weak, or weakened by former
Sweating.

42. Nor ought they to be given where the humors are thick and many: nor in
Tumors, lest the morbifick matter being carried to the Skin, should evaporate
the thin, and leave the thick behind, to close the pores of the Skin, and so
cause a Scurf, or an incurable Hardness.

43. But in old and cold Diseases as Distillations, Catarrhs, Palsies,
Sciatica's, Gouts, Numbness, pains of the Joints; as also after Universal
purgings, and in the declination of Diseases, they are of exceeding good use:
so where the Humors are thin.

44. But they are of most admirable Effects in the Measles, Small Pox, all
sorts of Malign, and pestilential Fevers, wherein, they may safely be given
without respect to either Time, Disease, or Strength of the Sick. See cap. 9.
Sect. 14.

Of PTARMICKS.
45. Ptarmica are such Medicines as purge the Brain by the Nostrils, and that
either by a Flux of matter, or by Sneezing.

46. Those Medicaments which draw a Flux of matter, are called Errhina, or
Errhins; and these are either Liquid or Solid.

47. The Liquid are either in form of Water or Juice, which are either anointed
within the Nostrils, powered in, or east in with a Syring.

48. The Solid are made out of convenient Roots, Stalks, Bolus's, or
Electuaries, made nearly, stiff enough to make into Pills, and formed almost
pyramidal, of about an Inch and half long; or, they are formed of the Powder of
Simples, which are blown into the Nostrils with a Quil.

49. The Intentions of these are, to open, obdurate Obstructions of the Head,
such as have been of ten, twenty, or thirty years standing, where, by
inveterate Headaches, Megrims, Vertigo's, Carus, Lethargy, Dullness, Dimness of
Sight, Stoppages of the Nostrils, (causing the party to keep their Mouth always
open) Epilepsies, Apoplexies, Convulsions, Palsies, Catarrhs, Ulcers of the
Lungs Consumptions, Kings Evil, Quinsies, Coughs, Asthmas, and a multitude of
other such like, chronick, stubborn, and rebellious Diseases, are as it were
infallibly cured, the Brain cleansed, and the animal Spirits made clear; It is
a way of purging the Head admirable and easy, and will do more at eight or ten
times using than could possibly be done by ten thousand Cephalicks or head
Purgers, given by the Mouth in what form you please, if possibly so many could
be taken.

50. These by their attractive quality, dissolve and draw the Phlegm into the
Nostrils, which hangs about the Pellicles of the Brain; and by their Acrimony,
they provoke the Expulsive Faculty to cast it out, with such Excrements also as
stick in the Brain it self.

51. Those Medicaments which evacuate humors by sneezing, are called
Sternutatories.

52. They strengthen the Head, and purge the Brain of Phlegm and Water, being of
admirable use in gentle Obstructions, which have been of no long time standing;
as also in other Diseases of the Head, proceeding of Cold.

Of SALIVATICKS.
53. Salivatica are Medicines purging by the Pallet, causing spitting; and they
are either Apophlegmatizers, Expectorators, or Mercuriates.

54. Apophlegmatizers, are such as by chewing or gargling, draw down Phlegmatic
Excrements from the brain, by the Pallet: but such as are chewed, are properly
called Masticatories.

55. Expectorators are such as by the Pallet evacuate humors contained in the
Breast and Lungs: Their chief uses are in Coughs, Asthma's, Wheesings, Ulcers
of the Lungs, Shortness of Breath. Obstructions of the Stomach, etc.

56. Mercuriates are such Medicines, (as well outward as inward) which being
made of Quicksilver or Mercury, purge universally the whole body, by the
Pallet, causing a Flux of Rhume or Spittle.

57. Their chief uses are in in the Pox, Gonorrhaea virulenta, Gout, Sciatica,
Kings Evil, Scorbute, and other the like chronick, poisonous, rebellious and
slubborn diseases.

CHAP. XIII. Of the Accidental Virtues of Medicaments.
1. THE Accidental Virtues of Medicaments, are the Complements of the Essential.

Thus, A Medicine essentially provokes Urine; it therefore essentially cures
the Stranguria, etc. But by accident it helps the Dropsy, because it is a
watery Disease.

2. Therefore Medicines are considered in the Cure of Diseases under a twofold
Notion, to wit, as they either alter, or resist Poison, or purge.

3. Altering Medicines are considered, first, as they change the Temperature;
secondly, as they ease Pain; thirdly, as they restore something that is lost.

4. Those which alter the Temperature, do it by their Contrariety in Heat, or
Coldness, Moisture, or Dryness; and so make soft, relax, rarifie, open, bind,
draw, repercuss, discuss, cleanse, etc. and all this, as they are appropriated
to the Head, Breast, Heart, Stomach, Liver, Spleen Reins, Womb, Joints.

5. Those which ease pain, do it by Sympathy, as all warming things which are
called Anodyns: or, by Antipathy, as all cold things which are called
Narcoticks.

6. Those which restore something are called Analepticks, which are such things
as either increase Flesh, called Sarcoticks, as in Wounds and Ulcers; or add
Strength and Magnitude to the body, or some of it is parts, as in Consumptions;
which last, are only properly called Analepticks, or Restauratives.

7. Medicines resisting Poison, commonly called Alexipharmicks, or Counter
Poisons, are such as either defend the Heart and Vessels against the force of
the Poison, as Mithridate, Treacle, Virginian Snake-root, Contrayerva, Salt of
Vipers, Liver of a Mad Dog, etc. Or else such as, by Antipathy, destroy the
Nature and Essence of the Poison, as Salt of Tartar, and indeed all Alcalies:
or the Oils of Sulphur and Vitriol, and all the greater Acids, as they are
opposite to the nature of the Poison.

8. Purging Medicaments are considered as they evacuate, 1. By Stool. 2. By
Vomit. 3. By Urine. 4. By Sweat 5. By the Nose. 6. By the Pallat.

9. Those which evacuate by Stool, cure Diseases of the Humors, Belly, and
Joints: Those by Vomit, Diseases of the Stomach, Liver, Spleen, Gall, Joints,
and habit of the body. By Urine, Diseases of the Reins, Bladder, and Abdomen.
By Sweat, Diseases of the whole body, universal Corruptious, malign Fevers,
Plague, Poison. By the Nose, Diseases of the Head, as Apoplexes, Lethargies,
Frenzy, Madness, Epilepsie, Vertigo, Megrim, Headache, Sleepiness,
Convulsions, Palsies, Catarrhs. By the Pallat, Diseases of the Lungs, Liver,
Spleen, Bones, Joints, Diseases oecult, malign, and poisonous.

10. Therefore consider the places where Diseases lodge, the Humors from whence
they come, the Temperature that they have, the Effects that they produce, and
the Symptons by which they are known: and so according as a Medicine is said to
be either appropriate to that part, depress that humor, alter that Temperature,
destroy those Effects, or abate those Symptoms, either in part, or in whole; so
shall the Medicine be said to be accidentally helpful in, or good against the
Disease afflicting.

11. Hence the essential Virtues vf Medicines are taken from their Property
alone, by Cap. 9. and 10. The Accidental from their Properties conjoined with
their Temperatures and Appropriations, by cap. 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

CHAP. XIV. Of the Choice of Medicines.
1. MEdicines are to be chosen, either in respect of their matter, or in
respect of their use, or in respect of their form.

2. First, in respect of their matter. 1. That it may be powerful in rooting
out of Diseases. 2. That it may be cheap, and so the more applicable to the
poor and needy. 3. That it be easy to be made, to prevent Error in
Preparation. 4. That it be small in Composition, to avoid as much as may be
Hetrogenity in Nature. 5. That it be made pleasant as may be, to deceive the
Palate, and not become loathsome to the Stomach. 6. That it be small in dose,
because large Doses, and great quantities, not only overcome the Stomach and
burden Nature, but also bespeak so much the less Virtue in the Medicament. 7.
Lastly, that it may be durable, to retein it is Strength and Virtue through many
Ages; and this it can only attain through an exact Purity. And those are the
things which we have been as eareful as might be, to observe, in handling the
following parts of this work, and to communicate to the World without deceit.

3. Secondly, in respect of their Use or Intention. First, That they sympathize
with the part affected. Secondly, With the Habit and Constitution of the Body.
Thirdly, That they may be Specificks (if possible) against, and powerful to
root out the Disease afflicting. Fourthly, That they may be pleasant and
grateful to the Sick.

If one be to cure a Disease of the Head, besure it be with a Cephalic
Medicament. Secondly, Let it sympathize with the Constitution; so that whether
Salt, Sulphur, or Mercury abound, the Medicine may answer in Quality, viz. Be
either Saline, Oleaginous or Spirituous. Thirdly, Be sure all this while, it be
a proper Specific against the Disease. Fourthly, Endeavor to make it pleasant
to the Pallat and Stomach, and if it be not pleasant, give it in a pleasant
Vehicle; for, when all is done, if the Stomach loathes and abominates it, it
will prove insucoessful, nor will it answer the intended end; for, the Stomach
not embracing, but rejecting it, it is Virtues can be communicated to no part of
the whole man. By this you may easily perceive, how, out of variety of
Medicines (all equally powerful against the same Disease) to choose that which
shall really do the Cure: and without the Knowledge and Observance of which,
(although the Medicine be both proper and powerful, absolutely to extirpate the
Malady, yet) you shall wholly miss of the end. Now, the reason is this, if the
Medicine be homogenious with Nature, and the Stomach, (which is the Index of
Nature) it joins it self with it, and so easily overcomes the Disease, there
being two against one: but if it be beterogenious with Nature and the Stomach,
(although it be a real and powerful Specific, yet) then it performs nothing,
because it has two Enemies to contend with, to wit, Nature and theDisease.

4. Thirdly, in respect of their Form. 1. According to the Nature and Situation
of the Disease, the Medicament is either to be Internal or External, or both.
2. If it be Internal, it is either cast in by the Mouth or by the Lower parts,
and sometimes both ways: for, sometimes the inferior parts are so obstructed,
that the things given by the mouth, can do no great matters, till those
Obstructions be removed. 3. If the Medicament be external, it ought to have
respect to the Part, to the Pain, and to the Disease. In respect of the Part,
it ought to be hard or soft, moist or dry. In respect of the Pain, it must be
anodyn or narcotick. And in respect to the Disease, it ought to be specific..
4. If both Internals and Externals be applied, the Considerations ought to be
conjunct, as aforesaid.

CHAP. XV. Of the Forms of Internal artificial Medicines.
1. OF the Forms of Chemical Medicaments. 1. We have already delivered the
Forms of Chemical Medicaments in Our Pharmacopaeia lib. 6. cap. 16. and that in
a very particular manner; yet, besides what we have there delivered, these few
following things may be observed. 2. In distilled Waters, if you cohobate the
matter distilled often, it will be much the stronger and better: and if you
impregnate the Water with the Salt of the Ashes, it will make the Water not
only more virtuous, but more durable. 3. In making of Spirits from Juyces; if
the Juice be strained from fermented matter, and be fermented again with fresh
Herbs, there will be a greater plenty of Spirits. 4. In making of distilled
Oils from Vegetables; they ought first to be putrified; and then from that
putrified matter you may draw off the Oil (with some Spirits and a water) in a
Vesica, which by a glass Funnel, with a small Orifice, you may separate.
Moreover, dry Herbs yield more Oil than green; but Peels of Oranges, Limons,
etc. not dry, are best. 5. Tinctures are made with S. V. simple, or tartarized,
or acuated with Spirits of Vinegar, Sulphur, Vitriol or Salt; to lb 1. of
which, put of the matter of which you would make the Tincture, being dry, or
rasped, or grossly beaten, j. ij. or iij. to wit, so much as may yield Tincture
enough to fill the body of the Menstruum; digest in a warm place, till the
Liquor will no more augment it is Color or Taste; then decant it off, and filter
it; or, which is better, purify it by long Digestion. Mineral Tinctures are
extracted with Spirits of Vinegar, of Honey, of Sugar, of Salt, Vitriol, or
Sulphur: but an admirable Menstruum (whether for Vegetables, Minerals, or
Animals) is the Spiritus Vini Philosophicus Kirkringii, and that of Basil
Valentine, as also, Aqua Calcis. 6. Extracts are but only Tinctures
inspissated; for while the Menstruum remains unseparated, it has the Title of
Tincture: after Separation, it is called an Extract. These are most commonly
made of Purgatives, more seldom of Alteratives: and sometimes the Menstruum is
fermented Spirit of Malt, Honey, Sugar, etc. 7. In making of Magisteries, it
is to be observed, that if the matter, be very hard, as Stones, and such like,
that it will be best to be first calcined. 8. Salts are to be confidered in a
twofold Respect; viz. as volatile or fixed. The Volatile are raised by many
Cohobations of the Spirit or Liquor distilled upon the Faeces or Caput mortuum,
as we have taught in Our Pharm. Land. lib. 4. cap. 5. Sect. 1.9.29. and 32. The
more that there is raised of this Volatile Salt, so much the less will you find
of the fixed, which is made by Incineration. You may also have the Essential
Salt another way, according to that which we have taught in making the
Essential Salt of Sorrel, lib. 2. cap. 10. Sect. 5. And here both volatile and
fixed are conjoined. Fixed Salts if they be made very pure, by many
Incinerations, Dissolutions, etc. ought then to be given in a larger dose:
moreover, that the lixiviate Taste may be taken away, you ought to mix them with
an equal quantity of Sulphur, and then set them on fire; so will they be not
only more pleasant, but also much better resist the Penetration of the Air:
these fixed Salts distilled as common Salt (as some Chemists affirm) will yield
a most picrcing Spirit.

All artificial Medicaments have a twofold method of Preparation, as we have
hinted in Our Synopsis Medicinae, lib. 3. cap. 1. Sect. 17. to wit, either
Galenical or Chemical; and each method has its several mode or manner of
perfecting the thing designed; from which modes or ways of preparing arise
various forms of Medicines, which are either fluid, soft only, or solid;
according to the Constitution and matter of which they are made: and from which
form and matter arises their Division, Use, and Application, both to Internal
and External Purposes and Affects.

We here intend to show the principal Forms of Galenical Preparations, which
are in Number fourteen, viz. 1. Essences. 2. Wines. 3. Vinegars. 4. Infusions.
5. Decoctions. 6. Syrups. 7. Quiddonies. 8. Lohochs, 9. Preserves. 10. Sugars,
11. Pouders. 12. Electuaries. 13. Pills, 14. Troches. There are many other
Titles of Forms, but they are particular, as being derived either from some
part of the Body, or some singular formality of the Preparation; or, from the
manner of their Operation; or, lastly, from the manner of their Exhibition; all
which, are comprehended under some of those we have already named.

2. To make or prepare Essences.

1. Essences are made of the Juyces of Green herbs, pressed out with Spirit of
Wine, and digested in B. M. where they receive their Color, separated by
Inclination, and with a little Sugar reduced almost into the form of a Syrup.
2. The former way is good: But some, and they no mean Artists, make all
vegetable Essences only by Putrefaction; the Herb being bruised and putrified,
the Juice is separated while it stinks abominably; this is kept, and in one
Revolution it suffers a Change, the Internal Spirit or Agent revives, and the
Seminal Idea has a Resuscitation, Corruption puts on Incorruption, and a new
body appears in it is Purity (and Immortality, as in a Sense it may be said)
having the same natural Odor or Smell, and Taste, with that growing in the
Fields, or Garden; but much more pure, clear, perspicuous, powerful, strong,
and pleasant; containing in it self, all the natural Principles of which mixed
Bodies are composed, but separated from their Putrefaction and Filth. 3. From
hence appears how close the Spirit and Souls of things, adhere to their own
matter; that although the external form is destroyed, and the matter it self
bruised, broken, and as it were mortified; yet the Internal energetick power,
Life, or Idea, can suffer no Hurt, Diminution, Loss, or Change, but remains
eternally unalterable in it is pristine Estate, being at most, but only clouded
by the Alteration of the said external form. I could speak almost infinitely
about this Subject, and give Demonstrations not to be refuted: but I am
confined here to be short. 4. The Essences of Minerals are not to be prepared
without great Difficulties, because their bodies must also be brought to a
perfect Mortification and Putrefaction; but of this we shall say nothing here,
referring it to another place.

3. To make or prepare Wines medicate.

The ground of medicate Wines is commonly Rhenish, Sherry, or Canary; and they
are medicated by Digestion (in a gentle heat) of the designed Medicament. To
every Gallon of Wine, if you use dried herbs, you may put M. iv. If Juyces, lb
ij. If of Spices or Aromaticks, viij. If of Catharticks, xij. If of Emeticks,
chiefly, Antimonial, iv. But if you design the Aromatic or Spicy Wine to drink
for pleasure, ij. of the Spices will be sufficient, adding a little treble
refined Sugar.

4. To make or prepare medicate Vinegars.

The Foundation of these kinds of Vinegars, is pure Spirit of the best or
sharpest Wine Vinegar; of which, you may take one Gallon, and put thereto, of
dried Herbs Flowers, or Seeds, xvj. or better. If of Spices or Aromaticks,
viij. If of Alexipharmicks, xx. If of Vegetable Emeticks, xiv. or xviij. put
all into a glass Vessel, stop it close, and digest in the Sun for forty days,
or else in a gentle Sand heat, then decant, strain, and keep it for use.

5. To make or prepare Infusions.

. Let the Simples be cut, stamped, or rasped, then infuse them in Water, Whey,
or Mead, which agrees best with your Intention; set them in the heat of Ashes,
Sand, Sun, or naked Fire, for a day, two, or three, according to the Quality of
the things to be infused: The quantity of the Liquor is to cover the
Ingredients three or four Inches above them.. 2. Some instead of the former
Liquors use a Lixivium of Salt of Tartar; but then it is not properly what we
call an Infusion. Others use Aqua Calcis, or water of Quicklime, which is an
admirable Vehicle. 3. Infusions are chiefly used for purging Potions, upon
present occasions: but if the things be infused in S. V. or other strong
Menstruum, it is called Tincture, not Infusion.

6. To make or prepare Decoctions.

Take Spring or Rain water, Whey, Beer, Metheglin, or Wine, in which, put
either Weeds, Barks, Roots, Seeds, Leaves, Spices, or Flowers, being cut,
rasped or ^bruised; a pound of Ingredients, more or less (according to their
Strength) to a Gallon of Liquor, boil them in a glased earthen Vessel, or a
Copper Vesica tin'd within (commonly called a Dyet-Pot) close covered, to the
Consumption of a third or forth part of the Liquor; then clarify it with
whites of Eggs (if you so please, or it be not thin and clear enough) sweeten
it a little, and aromatize it with a few grains of Musk, or Tincture of
Ambergrise: if it be for Women, you may do it with Cinnamon. Decoctions are
chiefly used in Diets for affects of the Belly, Reins, and Womb; as also in
Distempers of the universal habit of the Body, as Scorbuts, Dropsies,
Consumptions, etc. and in all manner of Obstructions of the Breast, Stomach,
Liver, Spleen, and Womb, whatsoever.

7. To make or prepare Syrups.

1. The ordinary way. If the things be green, take their expressed Juice; if
dry, a strong Infusion or Decoction of them: This Juice, Infusion, or
Decoction, clarify with whites of Eggs, or otherwise; and to every Pint put
lbij. of good white Sugar, boil them together to the Thickness of new Honey,
taking off the Skum if any arises; then strain it, being hot, through a Flannel
bag, and keep the Syrup for use. 2. After this manner, are made the Syrups of
all cold, moist, and juycy Herbs. 3. But if you make your Syrup of hot and
spicy or Aromatic things, dry them and infuse them in S. V. (simple or
tartarized, or acuated with Oils of Sulphur, Vitriol, or Salt) ij. more or
less, (as the Ingredients are in strength) to a Pint: Digest in a very gentle
Balneo or Sand heat; close stopped, for ten, twenty, thirty, or forty days, as
the matter is in hardness; shaking or stirring it twice every day; then being
settled, decant off the clear Tincture, and with most pure Sugar, or clarified
Honey, a pound to a pound, both being put into a Pelican, let them circulate
for a month upon a gentle Heat; then pour it forth, and keep it in a glased
Vessel for use. 4. Zwelfer has another way of making Syrups, by distillation in
M. B. which is a very excellent way; you may see it in our Pharmacopaeia
Londinensis, lib. 4. cap. 16. Sect. 9. at large. 5. Faber a most excellent and
learned man, has also another way of preparing Syrups, no way inferior to the
former, only it is more troublesome to do: you may see it in our said Pharmacop.
lib. 4. cap. 16. Sect. 100. To which I refer the Reader.

8. To make or prepare Quiddonies.

1. Quiddony is the same thing which we call Rob or Sapa: It may be made of the
Juice of any Herb, Plant, or Fruit; but it is for the most part, made of the
Juyces of Fruit in this manner. 2. Take the Juice you intend to make a Quiddony
of, boil it gently, to the Consumption of a third part; then add to what
remains, half it is quantity or weight of White Sugar, and by repeating the
boiling to a just Thickness, make Quiddony. 3. Marmalades or Gellyes, are made
after the same manner, the Difference only being, that these latter are made of
the Pulp.

9. To make or prepare Lohochs.

1. Take any Infusion, Decoction, Tincture or Juice, of which, make a Syrup
according to Art; or take the Pulp of any fruit brought to a good Softness: To
this Syrup or Pulp lbj. add impalpable Powders of the things you design to make
your Lohoch of, ij. viz. a sixth part; mix and make a Lohoch, according to Art.
2. This is a needless Title among the forms of Medicaments; for although, it be
thicker than a Syrup, and thiner than an Electuary, yet it is, in Truth,
nothing more or less, than a soft Electuary.

10. To make or prepare Preserves or Conserves.

The way of making or preparing of Preserves and Conserves, whether of Roots,
Stalks, Barks, Flowers, Fruits, and Pulps; and those either with Sugar, or
Pickle, we have so largely and plainly taught in Our Pharmacop. lib. 4. cap.
19. that nothing more need be said here.

11. To make or prepare Sugars, Confects, or Lozenges.

1. Take white Sugar, dissolve it in Rose Water, or their proper Liquor, beat
them very well with whites of Eggs, and clarify it by boiling; strain through
a Cloth, boil again, till the Water is nearly consumed, which done, put in the
matter you would make Lozenges of, and then boil gently again, till it rises up
in great Bubbles, and being chewed, sticks not to your Teeth: then pouring the
matter upon a cold Marble, anointed with Oil of Almonds, (letting first the
bubbles sink after it is removal from the Fire) there work it with your Fingers;
and your hands being rubbed with the powder, of which your Mass is made, form
it into Lozenges, of what Fashion you please. 2. Here note, that the matter you
intend ought to be in a very fine impalpable powder if it be for Lozenges. 3.
Otherwise, if you take Juyces, and order them in the aforegoing Method, they
are properly called Sugars. 4. But if you take the things whole, whether Roots,
Tops of Herbs, Flowers, Fruits, Seeds, Barks, or Peels, and cover them with
Sugar, they are then called Confects: it is done thus. Take Liquid Sugar, or
Sugar made into a strong Syrup, with water, or Rose water: and putting the
things to be confected into a brass Basin or large Copper Vessel, let the
melted Sugar drop thereon from a place above, through a very small hole in a
Funnel; then continually move and shake the things over a convenient Fire of
Charcole, that the moisture may be consumed, and the Sugar clear, and at length
cover it over with a Crust. 5. Lastly, if you would make Confects crusted with
Sugar Candy, it is like that of Candying, only it differs in the Thickness of
the Liquor.

12. To make or prepare Pouders.

1. These are made of Vegetables, by drying them choicly, and beating them in
an Iron Mortar, with an Iron Pestle, adding in the beating now and then, a few
drops of Oil of Sweet Almonds, to facilitate the Labor, and this more
especially, if they be Resinous; then searse them by degrees, as they grow
small. 2. Minerals are brought to a powder by first calcining them, and then
beating them without Oil. 3. Let them be kept alone, but when they are
exhibited, adjoyn to them their equal weight of Sugar.

13. To make or prepare Electuaries.

1. Clarified Honey, prepared according to Art lbj. or xij. melt it; to which
add of the things you would make into an Electuary, (being first reduced into a
very fine or impalpable powder) iv. v. or vj. according as you would have the
Electuary in Thickness: mix them well together, stirring them till the Honey is
cold. 2. Put the Electuary either into a Glass, or glased Vessel, to keep;
else, it will pierce it. 3. Fill it not above 2/3 parts full, otherwise by
reason of it is Fermentation it will run over. 4. Tie it over with a Bladder,
and a Leather over that. 5. Note also, that if the Pouders be mixed with
Essences, Liquors, or Syrups, they are called Mixtures.

14. To make or prepare Pills.

1. Let your Medicines be brought to a fine Powder, and with any proper clammy
Liquor, (as Syrup of Vinegar, Limons, de Spina Cervina, or Honey) beat them
well in a Mortar, till they are exactly mixed, and stick well together. 2. But
here note, first, that purging Medicines ought chiefly to be made into Pills.
Secondly, That a small quantity of Cremor Tartari, or Crystals thereof be added
in the Composition; for that will make them work more nimbly and pleasantly. 3.
It is also to be observed, that Extracts and insipate Juyces, are better made
into Pills with proper Pouders, than by Inspissation only. 4. At the end, add a
few Drops of some Chemical Oil, as of Anise, Caraways, Cloves, Sassafras,
Rhodium, or some such like. 5. When you form the Mass, or any part of it into
Pills, you may (as the patient pleases) gild them with Leaf gold, by rouling
the Pills up in a Leaf, and shaking them in a Box.

15. To make or prepare Troches.

1. Bring your Medicament into fine Powder; and with the Dissolution of Gum
Tragacanth in Rose water, or Wine (persumed with Tincture of Musk or
Ambergrise, if you so please) make Troches, which dry in the Sun, or a warm
Oven. 2. But here note, first, if you make them long, they are called Rotulae
or Rouls; if broad, they have generally a Character impressed upon them, (as a
Viper, upon Troches of Vipers) Secondly, if they be of no regular form, but
irregular, they they called Morselli, Morsels. 3. Those which are made up with
fine Sugar, or Sugar Candy, are called Sugars, or Lozenges.

CHAP. XVI. Of the Forms of External artificial Medicines.
Consideration being had to this our brief Method, and our original Purpose and
Intent, which was to emit things needless, seldom used, useless or
unprofitable, and only to represent what is really the more effectual and
powerful to destroy, extirpate, and root out diseases; We out of the intricate
Labrinth of Authors, and great Variety of Forms, have only chosen these eight;
viz. 1. Lotions. 2. Oils 3. Balsams. 4. Ointments. 5. Cerates. 6. Emplasters.
7. Cataplasms. 8. Clysters; as being sufficient enough to exhibit the Virtues
of any Medicament whatsoever, according to any Intention or purpose.

1. To make or prepare Lotions.

1. Lotion is a general name given to all kind of Liquors for External use; but
in their particular Applications, they have as many various Names as
Intentions. 2. First, what is designed to beautify the Skin is called
Cosmetica. 2. If for the Eyes, Ophthalmica. 3. If for the nose Errhinum. 4. If
for Application by Sponge, Cloth, or Stuph, Epithema. 5. If for the Mouth,
Diaclysma. 6. If for the Throat, Gargarisms. 7. If for Washings, Lixivium. 8.
If for bathing, Balneum. 3. The Ground of all these is generally Waters,
Vinegar, Wine, Milk, Whey, Mead, Juice, or Lie: in which, the medicinal matters
are either infused, boiled, or dissolved; and then filtered, or strained, or
not; according to the nature and intention of the matter, for which it is made.

2. To make or prepare Oils.

1. If it be from hot Herbs, dry them, and infuse them twenty, forty, sixty, or
a hundred days in good Oil of Turpentine, or Amber; then strain and press them
out, repeating the Infusion if you please, two or three times; lastly, mix this
straining with double quantity of Oil Olive, and keep it for use. 2. But if
from cold Herbs, take their expressed Juice, and boil it in an equal quantity
of Oil Olive, to the Consumption of the Humidity, then strain, and keep it for
use. 3. But it will be much better, if you boil the herb and all being first
bruised, till it is crisp, then strain and press out; for by this means, the
Oil will be stronger, and of a green color, which last it would otherwise
want. 4. Some, before boiling, insolate for forty days in a ho^ Sun.

3. To make or prepare Balsams.

1. These are made of Oil, Butter, Fat, Suet, Turpentine, Wax, Gums, Rosins,
and other things, which will mix or melt. 2. Take Oil or Fat, and make it thick
by mixture only, or melting, with the things which you would have made into the
form of a Balsam; mixing with every ounce of Oil ij. of Sheep or Beef Suet. 3.
But here you must note, that if Juyces be added, they must be boiled to the
Consumption of their humidity, which is thus known; let a drop fall on fire
Coals, and if it makes no Noise, it is enough. 4. This also note, that let the
other Ingredients be what they will, if Oil, Turpentine, and Wax, be wanting,
it can be no proper Balsam.

4. To make or prepare Ointments.

1. If you make them of hot herbs, dry, and infuse them into Oil of Turpentine,
as we have taught above at Sect. 2. Then mix that Oil with Sheeps Suet, Hogs
Lard, or other Fat; and so much Wax as (being well melted) may make it of the
Consistence of an Ointment. 2. If the Herbs be cold, then take their expressed
Juice, and boil it in the aforesaid Lard, or fresh Butter, if you so please, to
the Consumption of the Humidity, adding at last, the Wax. 3. However, it will
be much the better, if you boil the Herbs and all, being first bruised, but not
juyced, till they are crisp, then strain and press out, so will your Ointment
be not only stronger, but of a delicate green Color. 4. Some, having bruised
the Herbs, beat the Lard with them, then insolate for forty days; and after,
boil as aforesaid. 5. Lastly, here note, that if it be made up without Wax or
Rosin, it is called a Liniment.

5. To make or prepare Cerates, or Cere-cloaths.

1. This form takes it is name from the Wax that is in it, being a very soft
sticking kind of Medicament, stiffer much than an Ointment, and yet nothing
near so hard as an Emplaster: But now in our days, all soft kinds of Emplaster
bear that name, although they have not the least Wax in them. 2. Take those
Ingredients you design to make your Cerate of, (reducing them, if they be
things that will not dissolve, into a subtle Powder put them into their equal
weight of Oil Olive, or other Oil; to which, add Turpentine, Rosin, A.p13. Wax
enough to give in the Consistence of a Cerate, or such a Thickness, that it may
easily spread, being cold. 3. For ordinary Uses you may spread the Cloth here
with but on one side; but for the first Intentions, for which they were
invented, the Cloth ought to be dipped in on both sides, while the Medicine is
scalding hot. 4. If instead of the Wax, you put in Pitch, or if you put in
Pitch also with your Wax, it is then called Dropax. 5. You may make it of what
Color your please; (if you avoid the Pitch) as Green by adding Verdigrise:
red, by adding Minium; yellow, by adding Oaker: blew, by adding Bice, or Smalt.

6. To make or prepare Emplasters.

1. They are made of sat things, Oils, Suet, Grease, Marrow, Turpentine, Wax,
Rosin, Gums, thus: Melt some of the aforesaid things, as Wax and Oil, then add
the Rosins (if there be any) and lastly, put in your pouders, if you design
them; stir them well from the Fire, till they are almost cold; then putting all
into cold water, work it well with your hands, and make it up into Rolls. 2. If
you add Litharge, you must boil it first in Oil. 3. If Gums be put in, they
must be first cleansed and dissolved in Vigar, or other Liquor. 4. If any
Decoction, Juice, or Mucilage, be put in, they must be first boiled with the
Oil, till their Humidity is exhaled. 5. Sometimes, instead of Wax, there is
added Labdanum, or other Gums, 6. The Proportions of each Ingredient cannot be
exactly set down; yet they are commonly an ounce of dry things to three ounces
of Oil, Fat, or Honey: an ounce of Wax, to four of Oil: an ounce of Rosin to
six or eight ounces of Oil or Grease.

7. To make or prepare Cataplasms.

. 1. A Cataplasme or Pultise is commonly made of Herbs dry or green, Roots,
Flowers, Seeds, Oils, Fats, Grease, Fruits, Bran, Oatmeal, crumbs of Bread, etc.
being beaten by themselves or with other things into a Pulp; or by beating the
dry things into a Powder, and making them into a Body with the moist. 2. It is
done either without or with fire. 3. Without fire a Pultise is made of green
herbs stamped, or of their juices, to which other Mucilaginous things are added.
4. With fire, the Ingredients being fitted and mixed, are boiled in a
convenient Liquor, as Water, Wine, Milk, Honey, Oil, etc. to their just
thickness. 5. Some Seeds as of Faenigreek, Lin, Mallows, Flebane, etc. are made
into a Mucilage by boiling first in Water. 6. Juicy Fruits are boiled in water
to be softened, and their pulse drawn out by a Sieve, and then other things
mixed therewith to the due thickness. 7. Green things ought first to be well
stamped, and then boiled to a Mucilage. 8. Lastly, Cataplasms are commonly laid
on pretty warm: but Anacollemata, which are Pultises for the Forhead; and
Sinapisms, which are to make the Flesh red, are laid on cold. 9. A Sinapisme,
Leven, Honey, Soap, or pulp of Figs boiled in Vinegar, ij. Mustard Seed well
beaten j. mix them.

8. To make or prepare Clysters.

1. A Clyster is a thin or Liquid Body impregnated with the properties of
Medicinal things, and cast into the Guts by a Pipe. 2. The Liquor is the
Infusion or decoction of Herbs, Plants, Seeds, Flowers, Pease, Flesh, etc. in
Water, Milk, Whey, Beer, Ale, Wine, Urine, Oil, etc. 3. The properties are
either purging or altering; the altering are either Emollient, cleansing.,
binding, Nephritick, Carminative, or Anodyne, etc. 4. The purging Clysters are
the more usual; they are made by boiling or infusing of the Purgative matter
(in double or treble dose to what you give by the mouth) in the intended
Liquor. 5. Altering Clysters are made by boiling in every pint of Liquor, of
the Medicinal Ingredients bruised from half an ounce to ij. ss. according as
the Medicaments are in strength; then straining and dissolving therein about j.
of common salt, or sal Gem. 6. If they be Emollient Clysters, you may mix with
them Oil iiij. v. vj or vij. 7. In purgative Clysters, if they be powders, you
need only mix them; of Electuaries or Extracts, only dissolve them in your
proposed Liquor, adding as aforesaid j. of sal Gem. 8. The quantity is for a
Child ab iij. ad vj. for a man ad xij. ad xvj. 9. To Clysters add Suppositories
and Pessanies: A Suppository must be hardish, smooth, long, and fit to put up
in to the Fundament, having in it all the medicinal properties of Clysters, as
Purging and Alterative: The Purging are either gentle, strong, or strongest:
Gentle, are such as are made of Bacon; of a Fig turned; of Goats, Ox, or Sheeps
Suet; of a Candles end; of Stalks and Roots, of Beets, Blites, Cabbage,
Mercury, Parsley, etc. Strong are such as have a little sharpness, as Alum cut
and formed; Honey boiled thick; Soap boiled; Turpentine; to which add Mustard,
Salt, Sugar: strongest are such as are made of Agarick, Aloes, Hellebor,
Scammony, Hiera Picra, Confectio Hamech, Gutta Gamba. 10. The way to make
Suppositories. Boil Honey gently to a thickness, so that you may handle it,
which you may try by droping it upon a cold Earthen dish; then pour it upon a
Plate anointed with Oil: if you will add any thing, do it in powder before
melting; otherwise make Rouls, and cover them therewith. The proportion of
Honey is j. of gentle purgers j. of strong purgers, common Salt, or Sal Gem,
from ss. ad ij. or j. 11. Pessaries are made for the Womb, in the same manner
as Suppositories (but of other Medicaments) being like in shape, but longer and
thicker. They are also put into a long Linen Bag, or tozed Wool; or may be
made of Roots of Madder, Cypress, Orrice.

CHAP. XVII. Of the Use and Application of Medicines.
1. THe use of Internal Medicaments are to be considred, either as to the time
of giving, or to the way and manner of giving.

2. The time is to be observed, in respect of the Quality: if it be an Alterer
only, it is best given overnight, unless it be a great opener: for then (as
Authors say) it is best given in the morning fasting, and sweating stoutly
after it; vix credo. All openers are certainly best given at night; for so
there will be the less danger the next day of taking cold.

3. If it be a purgative, let it be given in the morning; unless it be very
gentle, and then you may venture to give it overnight: otherwise it may be
given the one half at night, the other the next morning.

4. The way and manner of giving is taught from the form.

5. Waters are only Vehicles to convey other things in, down the throat.

6. Syrups may either be taken alone, or mixed with some convenient decoction,
Insusion, Water, Thicture, or Broth.

7. Tinctures and Spirits are best taken in some convenient Water or Syrup.

8. Essences, Oils, and Elixirs, are best taken in Broths, being first well
mixed with white Sugar) for so they least offend; or else with good and
fragrant Wine or Sack.

9. Pouders, Electuaries, Extracts, and Troches, are best made into a Bolus,
and with a little Syrup, or other moist thing swallowed.

10. Pills are best taken alone, otherwise with a little Syrup; or else put
into a stewed Prune, and so swallowed.

11. Magisteries and Salts are best taken in Broths: yet Magisteries may be
made up into a Bolus, and so taken well.

12. External Medicines, ought to be applied to the place grieved: Oils,
Ointments, and Balsoms ought to be anointed upon the part: if they be hot by
nature, let them be well rubbed in before the fire: but if cold, let the part
be gently anointed without.

13. Cerates, Emplasters and Cataplasms, ought to be spread upon Cloth or
Leather, and so clapped upon the place pained: the two first warm, the latter as
hot as it can be endured.

14. Lotions you are to Bath or Gargle withal: Clysters are to be cast in by
the Anus either with a Clysterpipe, or Clyster-Syring.

CHAP. XVIII. Of the Doses of Medicines.
1. ALtering Medicines if Temperate, are given a j. to two ounces: hot or cold
in the first degree from a dram, to six drams: in the second degree, from half
a dram to 4 drams: in the third digree, from a scruple to two drams: in the
fourth degree, from half a scruple to a dram.

2. Purgers which are mild and gentle, from an ounce to six ounces: those which
are mean, from half an ounce to two ounces: those which are strong, from a dram
to two drams: the strongest, from half a scruple to half a dram, As Mezereon,
Asarum, Colocynthis, Aloes; but Black Hellebor, Esula, Scammony, are given a
gr. x. ad xx. Elaterium, Euphorbium, a gr. iiij. ad viij. Crocus metallorum,
Mercurius, Vitae a gr. j. ad iij. or iiij. if in very strong Bodies.

3. In respect of Form; the common Dose is that which is given to one man at a
time; so Infusions, Decoctions and Waters, are given from two ounces to six
ounces: Clysters are given a pint at a time to Men; a quarter of a pint to
Children: Purging Lenitives, from one dram to two ounces: altering Electuaries,
from one dram to half an ounce: Elixirs, Liquors of Salts, and distilled Oils,
from five grains to a scruple: Altering Extracts, from a scruple to two drams:
Magisteries, from a scruple to a dram: Purging Extracts, from half a scruple to
two scruples: Purging Pills, from half a scruple to one dram: Troches, and
Salts of Vegitables, from half a scruple to half a dram, or something more:
Syrups, from an ounce to three or four: Mineral Powders, Spirits, and Oils,
from two grains to twelve.

4. But here you are to note, that these, nor any other Rules, can be so
absolutely general, but that there may be some exceptions, or particular
observations, which are necessary to be known, not being comprehended, in them;
so that notwithstanding the limitation of these Doses, they must be
proportioned from hence, according to the age and strength both of the
Medicament and Patient, giving to Children such a quantity, as may be well
considered with their Condition and Ability.

CHAP. XIX. Of Medicinal Requisites.
1. HE that would be an accomplished Physician ought to be furnished with three
things; First, Honesty, and a good Conscience: Secondly, A substantial, real,
and well grounded Understanding, through the whole Art of Medicine: Thirdly,
With all such Instruments and Necessaries, which are ordinarily made use of, in
the performing of any Medical Operation, whether Paraseuological, Chirurgical,
or Pharmaccutical.

2. As to the First, Th^^ he undertakes nothing, but what he really thinks he
can perform; and having undertaken it, to manage the Cure, with the greatest of
his skill, care, and diligence; to let the Patients health be his chief aim and
end; and to proportion the Value of the Cure, in some measure to the Quality,
and ability of the Patient, as well as to the difficulty, danger, and magnitude
of the affect; and Lastly, (setting Covetousness aside) to act as earnestly and
faithfully on the behalf of the Poor and Needy, where no recompense can be
expected; as of the Rich and Full, where large and bountiful rewards are
prostituted.

He that thus always walks, let the Blessings of the Highest for ever attend
him, with the Presence and Good Will of him that dwelt in the Bush: let his
Days he long, his Life without care, let his Enemies fall before him; let his
Name and Memory live; and arriving at the highest of Old Age, let his last End
be happy and honorable.

3. As to the Second: That he well understands the principles of Natural
Philosophy, the Mathematics, and Philology, (without which it is almost
impossible he should ever truly understand Medicine:) and then, that he has
often and seriously read over the whole Body of Physic, both Galenical and
Chemical, and been very conversant with the best Authors of both kinds, as well
in Anatomy and Surgery, as Pharmacy: And lastly, not only to be acquainted
Verbally withal the aforesaid speculations; but also Actually, let him perform
and manage every thing with his own hands: without which, all is but an Airy
knowledge, which can never perform great things, or create any true credit, or
lasting Fame.

Thus Practice will bring Experience, and Experience Reason; which will
manifest the true, essential, and intrinsic Virtues and powers of Medicaments;
without the real knowledge of which, no great Cure can be perfected, nor any
eminent thing attained.

4. As to the Third; That he be furnished with convenient Instruments: First,
To prepare Medicines with: Secondly, Instruments of Chyrurgery: Thirdly, A
convevient quantity and number, of the most effectual and choice Medicaments,
adapted to the most general and usual distempers afflicting mankind.

8. The Pharmaceutical Necessaries, are those Medicaments which we have
exhibited in the Second and Third Books of this present work; as also those in
our Pharmacopaeia Londinensis, lately Publiched, under the several Titles of
Waters ditilled, Spirits, Oils distilled and expressed, Balsams distilied,

artificial, Cerecloths, Emplasters, Cataplasms, Clysters, Suppesitories and
Pessaries.

9. But because it is not necessary to have in store all that Variety; and
because every young Artist is not able to make an Estimate or good choice of
the best and most effectual things; we shall here condescend a little to
enlighten the Industrious Student; and show as well how the Closet ought to be
furnished, as in our Synopsis Medicinae, we have given a Praemonition to the
Military Chest.

Out of this Compendium The Artist may choose what things he please; or
Substitute other experiments of his own in their place: A well disciplined
Professor may out of 50, or 60 good Medicaments find a Cure for most, if not
all Diseases happening to the Bodies of humane kind: and if he has a special
occasion for any other Specific, he may have it prepared on purpose for that
necessity, this is in truth the best way of dealing with Medicines.

CHAP. XX. The Art of Compounding Medicines.
1. ALL Diseases whatsoever are cured by Medicaments (whether Simple or
Compound) having a certain property, peculiar appropriation, and a distinct
limited Temperament.

2. Therefore, When any Disease falls under Consideration, in respect of Cure,
you are to consider the means or nature of the Medicament by which it is to be
removed, whether by alteratives alone, or by medicines taking away something,
or by medicines adding or restoring something: In order to which, if you have
none so Artfully or Skilfully composed, as you desire, but must constitute one
anew, you must carefully observe the following Rules.

3. Where Alteratives are only necessary, as in Diseases of Intemperature, you
are to choose such, as may alter the said Distemper, by an opposite quality, in
a certain and limited proportion; and withal, by such medicaments, as
(composing the said Temperament) may stronly Sympathize with the part afflicted.

Ex, gr. Suppose the Disease to be a Cephalalgia proceeding from a hot
Distemper of the head: in this case you ought to use a Medicament cooling, and
withal a Cephalic, such an one as may be made of Lettice, Plantane, White
Poppies, Violets, Housleek, etc. Suppose it should proceed from a cold
Distemper: then you must use a Medicament healing, and sympathizing with the
part as aforesaid, such as may be made of Peony, Spicknard, Betony, Featherfew,
Lavender, Bays, Pennyroyal, Rosemary, Anacardiums, Cubebs, Nutmegs, etc. The
like understand of other parts afflicted.

4. The next thing to be concluded on, is, the Degree of the Temperature in
which the Medicament ought to be composed. If the Distemper be light, the
Medicament need not exceed the first degree, whether it be of Heat or Cold. If
it causes great pain, but without Inflammation, it may be composed to the
second Degree of Cold. If the pain be so great, as to cause Inflammation or a
Fever, you may exalt it to the third degree of Cold: But if it be yet more
outrageous, as to cause a Frenzy, Delirium or Convulsion, the Medicine ought to
exceed to the 4th. degree.

5. Contrariwise, if the Disease proceeds of Cold: If it causes but a small
Obstruction and Stiffness, the Medicament need not exceed the first degree of
Heat: If it causes Numbness withal, you may compose it to the second Degree of
Heat: If the cold Distemper be so great, as to induce an absolute loss of
Feeling, or endangers a Palsy or Lethargy, you may exalt it to the third
negree of Heat: But if it be so extreme as to endanger the Dead Palsy, or a
Gangreen, you have a necessity to use things hot in the fourth degree.

6. The same Order and Difference you must observe in Passive Qualities of
Dryness and Moisture, making choice of things dry, for Diseases moist, and
things moist for Discases dry; withal, chosing such things as sympathize with
the parts affected.

7. These things being considered, it now remains to show how, according to
Art, to compose, to exalt, or to depress a Medicament to any degree proposed:
Or, to find out the exact Temperament of a Medicine: Or lastly, to augment or
diminish the Quantities of any of the Simples, keeping the desired Degree of
its Quality; all which in the following Sections shall be mathematically
explicated and demonstrated at large.

8. First, To compose a Medicine proposed in any Degree of Quality whatsoever.

Let the Qualities ascend from 1. to 10. so that Temperature may be equal to 5.
as in the following Table you see: where the upper Figures may stand for
differences to the lower Qualities, o. standing for Temperate: the degrees hot
and dry on the left Hand; those cold and moist on the right Hand: Setting down
the Differences in order, from the highest degree of Heat; and then by
Alligation alternate, take the alternate difference from the Degree proposed.

Hot and dry. 9. 8. 7. 6. 5. 4. 3. 2. 1. cold and moist. 4. 3. 2. 1. 0. 1. 2.
3. 4.

Ex. gr. Simples hot in 3. temperate; cold in cold in 1.3. what quantities must
be taken of each, to compose a Medicine cold in 2? Answer, 1 part hot in 3. 1.
part temperate. 1. part cold in 1.6. parts cold in 3. See the Example.

2 Cold 3 Hot. 3 8 1 1 0 Temp. 5 1 1 1 Cold. 4 1 1 3 Cold. 2 321 6

Exa. 2. Simples hot in 4. hot in 2. hot in 1. cold in 1. cold in 2. cold in 3.
What quantities of each will make a Medicine Temperate? Answer. 3 parts hot in
4. 1. part hot in 2. 2 parts hot in 1. 2 parts cold in 1. 1 part cold in 2. 4
parts cold in 3. as by the Operation you may see: Or by the second Operation, 3
parts hot in 4. 2 parts hot in 2. 1 part hot in 1. 1 part cold in 1. 2 parts
cold in 2. 4 parts cold in 3. both ways the quantity of the Medicine is 13.

Temp. 4 hot 5 ^ 3 Or thus temp. 4 h. 5 9 3 2 hot ^ 1 2 h. 7 2 1 hot ^ 2 1 h. 6
1 1 cold ^ 2 1 c. 4 1 2 cold ^ 1 2 c. 3 2 3 cold ^ 4 3 c. 2 4

9. Secondly, To find out the exact Temperament of a Medicine, dispose the
Simples into one row, with their quantities, against which set their qualities;
then multiply each quantity by its own quality, and substract the Sum of the
facts of hot from cold, moist from dry, or contrariwise, which divide by the
Sum of Quantities; the Quota's are the resultment, which is always of the same
with the greater Product.

Zinziberis j. call 3. sic. 3. Croci optimi, j. call. 2. sic. 1. Caryophillorum

Hot 16 4 64 81 (3 Hot. 1 3 3 1 2 2 2 3 6 22 2 3 6 22 81

Dry 16 4 64 78 (3 6/11 Dry. 1 3 3 1 1 1 2 3 6 22 2 2 4 22 81

Answer. 3 11/22 degrees. hot. 3 6/11 degrees. dry.
See the Operation.

Examp. 2. What is the Temperature of a Medicine having Simples vj. of one hot
in 3. moist in 2. and vj. of another, cold in 1. dry in 3?

Hot 6 3 18 12 (1 hot. Cold 6 1 6 12 12 12

Moist 6 2 12 6 ( dry. Dry 6 3 18 12 12 6

Answer. 1 degrees. hot. degrees. dry,
See the operation

The like Order you must observe as (in this second Example) in other cases
where the Medicament is more composed.

10. Thirdly, To augment or diminish the Quality of a Medicine to any degree
proposed.

Alligate alternately the Quality of the Medicine proposed, with the degree of
the Simple, with which you desire to raise or depress it: then say, as the
higher Alternate different is to the lower, so the Quantity of the Medicine
which you would raise or depress to the quantity of the Simple (whose quantity
you alligagated) which shall raise or depress the Medicine in quality, to the
degree desired.

We will take the second Example at Sect. 8. whose quality is temperate, and
raise it to one degree of Heat: what quantity must be added more of that which
is hot in 4. to make the Augmentation of its Quality. Answer. 4. as by Sect. 9.
you may easily prove.

6 5 3 Or thus. 1 0 3 9 1 4 1 3. 1. 13. 4. 3. 1. 13. 4.

11. Fourthly, To augment or diminish in quantity any Medicine, keeping its
first proportion and quality.

As the Sum of the quantities of the Simples, is to the Augmentation or
Diminution, so is the quantity of each particular to its Augmentation or
Diminution desired.

12. Fifthly, To find what quantity of any Ingredient is contained in any part
of a Composition.

As the quantity of the. Composition to the part given, so the quantity of the
Ingredient in the whole, to the quantity contained in the part proposed: Or
thus, As the quantity of the whole Composition, to the quantity of the
Ingredient in the whole: the part proposed, to the quantity of the said
Ingredient, contained in the said part.

13. If the Cure of the disease requires a Medicine, which may take away
something, which we call Purgatives; you are to consider the part or parts
afflicted, the matter afflicting: and by what ways and manner the diseased
matter may be carried off.

14. From the Consideration of the parts afflicted, you are to make choice of a
purgative, simpathizing with those parts, by cap. 11. sect. 10, and 11. From
the morbifick matter, the quality of the purging materials, by cap. 11. sect.
19. 1. From the place, the kind of the Purge is known, or the way and manor,
by which the morbifick matter may be carried out.

15. The first two Considerations are fully discussed in cap. 11, and 12.
aforegoing: the last only remains to be enenquired into; for some Diseases
require Catharticks, some Emeticks, some Diuretics, some Sudorificks, some
Ptarmicks, some Salivaticks; and that according either to the situation or
place of the Disease; or else according to the malignity or contumacy of the
Effect.

16. If the Seat of the Disease be in the upper Ventricle or Head, Catharticks
and Ptarmicks, chiefly solid Errhines, are of admirable use: If the matter
lodges in the Bronchia of the Lungs, or the Stomach, an Emetick is required: If
in the Guts or Bowels Cathartick Potions, and Clysters: If in the Reins or
Bladder, Openers and Diuretics: If in the Joints and extreme parts,
Catharticks, Emeticks and Sudorisicks: If in the habit of the whole Body,
Sudorificks are of singular use; but chiefly after Salivation, or the other
kinds of Purgation: If in the Mass of Blood, there is required the alternate
use of Openers, Diuretics, and Sudorificks, whereby the serous and windy
matter is taken away, both by Urine and Sweat. Lastly, if the Seat of the
Disease is in the Superficies of the Flesh or Skin, as in Apostems, Buboes, and
the like, all manner of Purgation is to be forborne, except that which drives
the matter outward; of which kind are all Diaphoreticks.

17. If the Disease be contumacious and malign, as the French Pox, Salivation,
(if discrectly used) may be prositable; so also in some other stubborn and
rebellious Diseases, as the Gout, Sciatica, etc. Catharticks effect much in
diseases recent, and in such Bodies which have not been used to much Physic.
But if the Disease i^ Chronick, or of long Standing, and deep rooted,
especially in some remote part, as in an excruciating Sciatica, Emeticks are of
wonderful force (if aptly chosen) and sometimes perform Cures even to a
miracle. In Diseases of the Reins and Bladder, as also in a Hydrops, Diuretics
seem to be the most proper Remedies: but in their use, you must be exceeding
cautious, lest you bring fresh Coals to put out the Fire. First, open the
passage by Apperitives. Secondly, make them very slippery with Oleaginous
things, such as are Oil of Sweet Almonds, Nuts, etc. Thirdly, exhibit the
Diuretic with an oily Body: lest the force of the Diuretic should heap up
much matter together, and making the Obstructions greater, should kill instead
of curing.

18. The Form of the Composition is to be chosen according to the place of the
Disease; Let it be solid (as in Pills and Troches) for Diseases in remote
parts: of a middle consistency, (as Syrrup, Lohoch, Quiddony) for Diseases of
the Mouth, Breast and Lungs: Liquid for Diseases of the Stomach and Bowels: If
this cannot be, you must follow the Fantasy of the Patient: But above all (if
it may be) every kind of Purge ought to be given in a liquid form, and in a
Spirituous Menstruum, or Vehicle (such as are the Tinctures of Grulingius)
because that it is probable, the Powers and efficacy of the Compositum, are
thereby received into the Veins; which by reason of the fluidity of the Salts,
and spiritous nature of the Vehiculum, are united to the Spirits and Vehicles
of the Blood, and so dilated through the whole sanguinous Mass; thereby
inducing Struglings, Combinations, Fermentations, Precipitations, and
Excretions of the morbifick matter: by which Diseases of parts at a great
distance, viz. cutaneous Diseases, Leprosi^s, Gout, Sciatica's Struma's,
Melancholy, Agues, etc. are oftentimes cured, beyond expectation.

19. The strength of the Ingredients are next to be considered, which is to be
fitted to the Age, Sex and Strength of the Patient, with relation also to the
Power and malignity of the Disease. If it be a Child or Womankind, or one of a
weak Constitution, or the Disease is recent, gentle, and without malignity; you
may choose Ingredients of a more weak and gentle operation: But if it be a man,
or one of a robust and strong Body, or the Disease is chronick, rebellious, or
contagious, you must choose things more powerful and strong: If the Patient be
weak, and the Disease strong, choose things indifferent; yet rather let the
Compositum respect the weakness of the Sick, than the strength of his Disease,
lest by endeavoring to destroy the Malady, so great a Chasm be opened as to let
out Life: In this case, let the Medicament be made gentle (especially at first)
then by degrees increase its force; and by long and many reiterated
exhibitions, perform that safely in length of time, which otherwise may not be
attempted without many doubts, and absolute apparent Danger.

20. The Numbers of the Ingredients, are only to respect the several Intentions
for which the Medicament is compounded; and herein you are to observe, 1. That
those intentions be not opposite one to another, as the Mixtion of Purgatives
with Astringents, Scammony with Opium etc. 2. That the chief Intentions be
drawn from the chief Symptoms or Indications of Cure; that the Medicament may
dispose of the morbifick matter, that way which Nature most inclines to: As if
the Stomach be oppressed and soul, to vomit: If a Cephalalgia be accompanied with
a great Cold, and Obstructions in the Head and Nostrils, to use solid Errhins:
If Wind oppress the Stomach, to use Aromaticks: If the Bowels, Carminatives,
etc. 3. That the number of the Ingredients be not need^esly increased above the
number of Intentions, to avoid as much as may be Heterogenity, and Confusion in
the mixture. It is a great Folly and Vanity in many men, premiscuously to
jumble up many things together, as if thereby the Disease was only to be
overcome; whereas those Compositions, for want of an exquisite Judgment in
choosing each Ingredient, become many times rather hurtful than helpful to the
Patient; and that great Variety of Simples, being commonly of different
Properties and Natures, often enervate and weaken the Powers and Forces of each
other, which in the more simple Compositions there is no need to fear.

21. The Proportions of the Ingredients are sometimes to be determined by the
gradations of their Temperature; of which we have spoken sufficiently before,
Sect. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. and this is always to be considered when the Disease
proceeds from a simple Intemperature. In all other cases the Proportions are to
be determined according to the Judgment of the Physician. And herein he is to
consider what he intends to make the Basis or Ground of his Composition (I
mean) not in respect of the Body or Matter; but in respect of that Ingredient
which answers to his Principal Intention; As in a Hydragogue Electuary designed
against Hydropical and watery Humors: I call not Honey the Basis of the
Medicament (though it be commonly of treble quantity to all the other
Ingredients) but that particular Hydragogue, which is principally designed to
evacuate the serous or watery humor. The chief material answer to the primary
intentention being found out, all the other particulars are to answer to it,
according to the exigency of those Causes which drew them into confederacy with
the first.

22. The Dose of the Compositum is to be drawn from each particular
constituting it, being a mean proportional between them all.

Exemp. gr. Sammony jss. Coloquintida j. Gutta Gamba, fine Aloes, A vj Extract
of black Hellebor. Turbith A iiij. Agarick ij, Elaterium j. ^r. mor Tartari x.
Cloves, Nutmegs, Cinnamon, Ginger, Anniseeds, A iij. make all into fine Powder
and mix them. What is the largest Dose of this Powder? First, consider the
largest Dose, or near thereto, of each of the Cathartick ingredients singly,
and you will find it to be of Scammony about gr. xv. of Colocynthis j. of Gutta
gamba, gr. xv. of Aloes ij. of extract of black Hellebor j. of extract of
Turbeth ss. Agarick ij. Elaterium gr. v. Secondly, find out how many of those
Doses are contained in each particular. In the quantity of Scammony, you will
have 48 Doses (for jss = xiij = gr. 720. which divided by gr. 15=48 doses:) In
the Coloquintida, you will have 24 doses; (for j = viij = xxiiij. or Doses:) In
the Gutta Gamba, you will have 24 doses, in the Alocs 9 doses, in the black
Hellebor 12 doses, in the Turbith 8 doses, in the Agarick 3 doses, in the
Elaterum 12 doses: (the other Ingredients are put in but to correct the
Purgers, etc.) Thirdly, find out the Sum or Number of those several Doses, by
adding them together: Scammony 48. Colocynthis 24. Cambogia 24. Aloes 9.
Hellebor 12. Turbeth 8. Agarick 3. Elaterium 12. All these being added
together, make 140 doses. Fourthly, find out the Sum or Number contained in the
whole Compositum, Thus, 12 + 8 + 12 + 8 + 2 + 1 + 10 + 15 = 68 drams: These 68
multiplied by 60. the number of grains in a dram, produce a fact of 4080
grains, the Sum of the whole Composition. Fifthly, divide the number of Grains
contained in the whole Composition, by the Sum or Number of the several Doses
added together, so will the Quotus be the number of Grains for the largest
Dose. So in this our Example, the number of Grains in the whole Compositum, are
4080. the number of the Doses before accounted 140. by which, if you divide the
said 4080. the Quotus will be gr. 29 1/7, or nearly gr. xxx. the largest Dose,
which is the thing required: from whence we conclude the aforesaid Medicament
may be given from gr. x. ad ss. according to the Age and Strength of the
Patient: The like must be done in all other Compositions.

23. If the Disease requires Medicaments which restore something, these
Intentions are necessary, 1. To open the Obstructions of the parts. 2. To
strengthen the parts afflicted, chiefly the Stomach. 3. To carry off the matter
obstructing by Medicines Oily, Balsamic, or Lenitive. 4. To nourish by strong
Analepticks.

Hitherto we have only shown the Art of Compounding, by Precepts: In some of
the Chapters immediately following; we will elucidate the same by manifold
Examples.

CHAP. XXII. Examples in compoundin^ Opiates, and Cordials or Antidotes.
1. BEfore we come to the Exemplary part of compounding Opiates, (that this our
Opiologia may be complete) we shall show you the Kinds, Natures, Qualities, and
seve^al Operations of Opium, both good and evil: and because that Famous and
Learned Man, Dr. Willis, has exquisitely performed the same, we shall (ceasing
at present our own Conceptions) give you here the Epitomy of what he has said
concerning Opium in particular, and Opiatick Medicaments in general; but in a
different Method.

2. The Kinds of Narcoticks are several, as Purslane, Lettice, Hounds Tongue,
Nightshade, Henbane, Tobacco, Mandrakes, Poppies, red, white, and black:
besides some other Simples extremely venomous, and so never medicinally
prescribed. The Juice and Seeds of Henbane are much used in some Hypnotick
Compositions: Mandrakes are seldom used. Hounds Tongue having a plain
soporiferons Odor, shows it is narcotick Nature; it is a very neat Plant, with
soft Leaves; and in it is flourishing Time, is crowned with a bright Red, and
most delicate purplish Flowers: the Powder of it is Roots goes into that famed
Opiate called Pilulae de Cynoglosso: the juice of the whole Plant gathered
about the beginning of the Spring, being expressed and depurated by a close and
warm Digestion, and decanted from it is Faeces, yields a clear Liquor, and
splendidly redish, and blushing like a Ruby. This may be used either for a
Menstruum, for making up of Narcotick Confects: Or, for to make an Hypnotick
Syrup: Or lastly, It Is Humidity being evaporated, to make Tinctures and
Extracts out of it, as is done out of Opium. Lettice and Purslane are used to
make Syrups of, which is done of their expressed Juice; which Syrups, are
commonly given to Children, and very aged People, (where Opiates may prove
dangerous) because they very gently, without any Prejudice, enduce Rest and
Sleep, and sometimes Indolency, as in Fluxes, Gripings of the Guts, and such
like. Nightshade is used to cause Rest by outward Application, to the Temples;
chiefly, it is depurated Juice, or distilled Water is taken, and being mixed
with Rosewater, the Temples are bathed therewith, then a Rose-Cake very hot,
and dipped in the same, is forthwith to be applied to the said Parts, and so
bound on. Tobacco is accounted as a Narcotick, although never put into
Narcotick Compositions; because its Fume taken in a Pipe, produces the same
Effects as they; yea, it does the same thing with our Countrymen, as Opium
does with the Turks, to wit, either of them by affecting the animal Spirits, by
an unaccustomed manner, and by rendering them as it were astonished, disposes
them to the doing or suffering of any thing without any great sense or trouble
of Weariness; it renders them fearless of dangers, and makes them patient in
Hunger, Cold, and Labor. When any one first begins to take Tobacco, he is for
the most part affected with a Vertigo, and Scotomia, then a cruel vomiting, and
sometimes purging follows, the Feet grow weak, the man staggers, the Hands
tremble, the Tongue faulters, or speaks at random, and sometimes a cold Sweat,
and terrible Swooning follows. The cause of all this, is, from the Animal
Spirits being, as it were, intoxicated by the Narcotick Sulphur, which are
distracted very much in their whole Dominion, and are agitated into Ataxias, or
Irregularities. But this Fume once becoming familiar and customary, it is on
the contrary grateful, and takes the Animal Spirits with so great a
Witchcraft, or pleasing Allurement, that some had rather be forbidden Meat or
Drink, than the use thereof. The reason of which is, that this Fume being once
made familiar with the said Animal Spirits, gently awakes, or stirrs them up at
any time being sluggish and sloathful, and as it were tickling of them,
provokes them into gentle and expansive motitions, with which they are
wonderfully recreated, as with the drinking of Wine.

3. The red Erratick, or Corn Poppy, has a great Hypnotick Quality, much
greater than any of the former things, though far less, more gentle, and more
benign, than that of the white or Black Poppy; and therefore in some cases it
is very needful, and may be more secure in its use. From this Poppy, the
Apothecaries prepare a distilled Water, and a Syrup, which are many times with
great advantage given in most continual Fevers, and are thought to be absolute
Specificks in the Plcurisy, because they truly take away pains; and by stopping
somewhat the pulse, depress the feverish Aestuation of the Blood. Empericks
prepare a Tincture from the Flowers with S.V. which has the aforesaid Virtues,
and have been oftentimes proved effectual against Surfeits: the reason of which
seems to be, that the Spirits of the Wine preserve the Contents of the Stomach
from putrefaction; and the Narcotick Sulphur of the Flowers, resist the
violence and heat of the assaulting Fever.

4. The White Garden Poppy is the next to be considered: From the Heads and
Seeds of this Poppy is made Diacodium, both liquid, as in Syrrup; and solid, as
in Tablets or Lozenges, and that according to the prescripts of many famous
men; from the same Decoctions, expressed Oils, Emulsions, and other Hypnotick
Confects are made: This Poppy abounds much more with Narcotick Sulphur than the
former, but with much less than the Black, of which Opium is made; and
therefore the Medicines aforenamed prepared from the White Poppy, as they
contain less of the said Sulphur, so are they much more pure and Innocent, and
are oftener and more securely given than any thing made of Opium: For it is not
convenient to use Laudanum or Opiates, unless, when for the vehemence of
Symptoms in any Disease, Diacodiates will do little or no good. And as
Diacodiates (which are preparations from the White Poppy) contain in themselves
less of the said Narcotick Sulphur, so they want not much preparation; but
being simply made by Infusion, Decoction, or Expression, they may be brought
into a medical use; whereas Opiates (which are preparations from the Black
Poppy) containing in themselves a vast quantity of the said Narcotick Sulphur,
are composed, corrected and made by diverse and various preparations of a much
higher Nature, that thereby they may become safe and practicable.

5. The Black Garden Poppy, is that of which our Opium is made, being a
concreted Juice flowing from the wounded Heads or Leaves of the said Poppy
being ripe: and from this Black Poppy, nothing more is taken for a medical use
than the said Opium, which is a Tear or Gum flowing as aforesaid. There are
several kinds of this Opium; but the best is the Thebian, being heavy, thick,
strong-scented like Poppy, bitter and sharp, inflamable, almost of the color of
Aloes, and easily dissolvable in Water, or almost any other Liquor. See our
Pharmacopaeia lib. 1. cap. 8. Sect. 50. where you may see the various
preparations thereof: its preparation with Adjuncts, or rather Compositions are
diverse and many. The most famous Opiates of the Ancients are Pilulae de
Cynoglosso, Requi^^ of Nicholaus, and Philonium, which last is fourfold, viz.
Roman, Persian, Magistrale of Mesue, and Tarsence of Gale^. The Opiates of
Neotericks from the Praise-worthiness of the same are commonly called Laudana,
and by some Nepenthes, from their taking away pain: these ought not to be
admitted into practice, unless invented by skilful Men, and of which long trial
has been made, of which there are many publicly extant, received and approved
of, the chief of which, are those of Paracelsus, Crollius, Quercetan, Hartman,
Mynsicht, and Helmont. The first five of which are composed only in the form of
an extract, whose Basis or Ground is the Tincture of Opium drawn forth with a
fit Menstruum, and then corrected with Saffron, Castor, Bezoar, Pearls, species
Diambrae, and several precious Chemical Oils. That of Helmont is a liquid
Tincture of Opium, drawn with Juice of Quinces fermented. And this may be given
ab ss. ad j. or somewhat more in any Cordial Vehicle, where the use of a Pill
cannot be admitted.

6. In treating about these 2 sorts of Laudana, we ought to have great respect
to the Menstruum. Some use S. V. because they think Opium cold: others Spirit
of Vinegar, or Juyces of Citrons or Limons, because they think the Opium hot
(as indeed it is) but this signifies nothing in respect to the heat or cold of
the Opium, but in respect to its Narcotick Sulphur, thereby to correct it. The
Ancients corrected it with things hot in the fourth degree, as Pyrethrum,
Euphorbium, Pepper, etc. out of a supposition that it was cold in the fourth
(but is indeed hot:) however those Correctives became most proper, because
these biting sharp things, being full of a volatile Salt, do predominate over
the Narcotick Sulphur of the Opium, and break its potency. Helmont used the
Juice of Quinces put into Fermentation; but Dr. Willis commends the S. V.
impregnated with the volatilized Salt of Tartar: Or the Tincture of the Salt of
Tartar brought to the highest Red by long digestion, which is the Basis of his
Liquid Laudanum, adding for its Complement, Saffron, Castor, Cloves and Lignum
Aloes: the Dose of which is, ab gut. xv. ad xx.

7. Opium consists of a vast quantity of sulphurous particles, mixed with some
saline volatile particles, with a little quantity of Earth. That sulphurous
particles do abound in it, is manifest to Sense, to wit, from its strong Odor,
and its Inflammability. The Volatile Saline particles are evident in its
sharpness, bitterness and pricking; as also from the Volatile Property of the
Opium, and its speedy ascending to the Head, and intangling of it self with the
saline volatile Spirits of the Brain; the Earth is apparent. Hence it appears,
that since a Narcotick Quality is contained in the Opium, that it is chiefly
lodged in the Sulphur thereof, because it is oftentimes found so hurtful to the
texture of the Animal Spirits, which its saline property would rather cherish,
as sympathizing with them. Now because the Animal Spirits may be of a differing
texture in diverse Bodies, therefore Opiates may work more strongly and
virulently on some than on others. The Turks, who have an adust Blood, and in
whom more fixed Spirits and less volatile are bred, cat Opium without hurt, or
at least without danger of Life; but the Europeans, who have more subtle and
purer Spirits, cannot do so. Dogs will devour Opium in a great quantity,
without either Sleepiness or Death; but a small Dose of it will presently kill
a Cat: for that the Spirits of this Creature are so very volatile and pure,
that that they cannot at all endure the Narcotick Sulphur.

8. Opiates as they are endowed with many great Virtues and excellent
Properties, so also have they some evil ones, and oftentimes deadly effects. We
have seen it by the sad experience of some, who have no sooner taken an Opiate,
but they have fallen into a perpetual Sleep; and some, who by taking too great,
or untimely a Dose, have rendered their Lives unhappy and unprofitable
afterward, by the hurt of the principal Faculties: Some by taking one Dose,
have fallen into so profound a Sleep, that they could never be awakened. They
have lived indeed 3 or 4 days, having their Pulse, Respiration and Heat well
enough; yet not to be recalled to Sense and Waking, by any Medicines or
Tortures: Some by taking it, have slept moderately, or almost nothing at all;
yet not long after, have grown very bad, languished, drawn their breath very
difficulty, their Pulse, natural Heat, and Strength of Body momentarily
decaying, in such sort, as not to be restored by any Cordials; these lingering
on by degrees lost their Lives. One by taking an Opiate, has presently fallen
into his last and deadly Sleep, complaining of a great weight and coldness of
his Stomach, by and by he was affected with a notable Languor, a sinking down
of his Spirits, and a coldness of the extreme parts; and within a few hours
after, complaining of the dimness of his Sight, and then of quite Blindness, he
streightway expired. The reason of this sudden destroying of Life is this,
that the Narcotick Particles of the Opiate, do forthwith, and vehemently affect
either the Cerebrum or Brain, or the Cerebellum, where, by oppressing the
Animal Spirits, as well the outmost Spirits as the internal or inmost, they
become greatly profligated and overthrown; where by their Forces, being
altogether suppressed, then presently a deep Sleep, or an invincible Drowsiness
and Stupefaction follows, which forthwith induces Death, the Pulse and
Respiration being in a good state for some time.

9. As for the harms that Opiates may do, they are not by me to be all here
enumerated. In the Head, they sometimes hurt the chief functions of the Mind,
as Memory, acuteness of Wit, Discourse: Sometimes the frequent use of Opiates
causes loss of Memory, and sometimes a Lethargy; and sometimes it does these
evils, by being given in too large a Dose. In some it has caused a Stupidity of
Wit, and in others perfect madness. The reason of these things, is as before
declared, for that the Narcotick Sulphur first and chiefly assaults the Brain,
where, whilst it destroys or profligates some Animal Spirits, it perverts many
others from their wonted ways of Emanation, and leads them into devious or
unusual Paths. In the Breast and Praecordia, it clearly appears, that they do
sometimes hurt the Vital Actions, from their depression of the Pulse and
Respiration, causing them to grow languid, or weak and difficult, and by
degrees, wholly to cease: wherefore in Fevers, where the Blood being greatly
depraved, yields but very few and weak Animal Spirits, Opiates are for the most
part hurtful, and as it were poisonous: For though in the Plague, and other
malignant Fevers, Mithridate, Treacle, Diascordium, yea and Laudanum are often
given with good Success, yet it is while the Pulse and Respiration are strong;
but if in those Diseases, or other Fevers they be weak, these famous Antidotes
are but very sparingly to be used; but stronger Opiates not at all: Also in a
vehement Cough, or Astmah, Empyema, and in other diseases of the Breast, where
Nature is suddenly provoked to the casting out of what is troublesome to the
part, and urges it with great endeavor, we must abstain from Opiates no less
than from Poison; because they increase the matter to be removed and fix it;
and also weaken the parts which ought to expel it. In the Belly and Bowels,
Opiates being often taken, are sometimes injurious to the principal Faculty,
viz. the Appetite, or desire to eat, on which depends all Nourishment, and the
root of Life. And the reason is, because the concoctive Faculty of the
Ventricle is debilitated, and the excretory motions of the Intestines made
sluggish, from the Stupefaction or Hurt of the Spirits inhabiting the Interior
Coat of the Stomach and Guts, so that those nervous Fibers, although empty, are
no more corrugated, from which cause all hunger ceases. And it is a common
Observation, That want of Appetite, and Slothfulness of the Belly, are the
familiar effects of Opiates.

10. How Opiates do affect the Animal Spirits, has been already in part
declared; not by raising Vapors into the Head, as some have thought, nor by
opening the Pores of the Brain, thereby to admit the soporiferous matter; but
only by destroying or profligating some Animal Spirits, wherefore the rest, as
being amazed, or compelled more inwardly, or at least being called back from
their wonted efflux into the Nervous Parts, do relinquish, or remit for a while
their required Tasks. This is evident, because Opiates taken in too great a
Dose, do destroy the Animal Spirits so abundantly, that they cause Death;
whereas given in a just dose, and to a fit object, although they may cause an
Overthrow and Amazement of some Spirits, yet they only allay the too great
fierceness and impetuosity of the sensitive Soul, that she, sinking down, as it
were, within her self, may lie quietly, or at rest and ease. This Property of
Opiates consists not in apparent qualities, as of Heat or Cold, nor in any
occult Quality; but in Particles, much contrary to the Animal Spirits, and
which may be said to be Extinguishers of them; but in what kind of
Subsistencies the contrary particles of either kind are, will be hard to show,
because not observable by the Sense. The Animal Spirits are thought to be most
subtle Particles, composed of Spirits and volatile Salt, united together and
highly exalted: So Opiates, on the contrary, may be thought to be composed of
stinking Sulphur, with Salt, and an Earthy Matter, so much opposite to the
subtle Texture of the Animal Spirits, that sometimes they profligate them at a
distance by their mere Effluvia.

11. Now the places in which Opiates do first and chiefly begin to operate, are
thought to be at the Shell of the Brain, to which, upon the Opiatick Particles
approach, the Spirits dwelling there, (they being, as it were, the Watchmen
that first of all) recede, and indulge the Body to Rest and Sleep; and it is
just so to think: For the Particles of every kind of Opiate, after it is taken,
being carried into the Blood, and circulated with it, does chiefly exercise its
Narcotick Quality, near the Shell of the Brain: for they meet within this place
the first Opposition, and forces the Animal Spirits, and destroy, or rather
extinguish wholly, many of these Spirits placed in the fore part of the Battle;
the other Spirits of this place not destroyed, go back, and by their Emanation
being restrained, fly toward the middle of the Brain, thereby indulging Rest
and Sleep; but yet by what means in so short a space, viz. sometimes before it
can be dissolved in the Ventricle, it should cause such an Operation, is not
easy to unfold. To this however we say, that the Journey from the Ventricle,
by the Blood, to the Head, is very expeditious, and may be performed in a very
little time: But should not this be granted, it is probable that Opiates may
act more immediately on the Ventricle, and by its mere Contact (from a consent
of the stomatick Nerves, with those of the Par Vagum in the Brain) procure the
said Rest and Sleep, before there can be any Commerce of the Particles of the
Opium with the Blood; and hence it is, that if the Stomach is afflicted, the
Head is not well, the afflictions and evils of either of them, do afflict each
other. Thus it appears, that the places where Opiates first exert their Power,
are the Ventricle and Cortex of the Brain, and from acting on those parts, they
first begin to procure sleep.

12. How far, or into what part Opiates do extend their Virtues, we shall now
speak, and show the Sphere of their Activity. By what has been already said, it
appears plainly, that they act upon the Animal Spirits: but whether the Blood,
and other Humors are hurt thereby, remains to be questioned. Certainly the
Blood is not at all vitiated by them: This we judge, First, from their so very
little Dose, by which it is not probable that the whole Mass of Blood should be
corrupted thereby. Secondly, for that though Narcoticks be often applied, no
Pustles, or little Whelks appear in the Skin or Viscera, as is wont to happen
when the Blood is empoysoned, or but a little corrupted, as it were, by an
ordinary Surfeit. Also those with whom Opiates are become familiar, are not
hurt in their Animal Spirits, although daily taken in a great quantity, so that
no Dyserasy of the Blood can come from thence. However it is not to be thought
that the Particles of Opiates, either agree with, or are assimilated to the
Blood, but are rather wholly Heterogenous and immiscible: for they no sooner
come into the Mass of Blood, but they are suddenly expelled from it, and from
thence being partly cast on the Cortex of the Brain, cause Sleep; and partly
thrust forth by the Pores of the Skin, stir up Sweat, and for the most part an
itching. As to the other Humors, we see not how Opiates do any ways hurt the
Serum, or Nervous Juice, or the Chylous Juice, so that their Virtue and Power
seems chiefly to adhere to the Animal Spirits. From hence we judge, that
Opiates given in a just Dose, only reach the Spirits in the Cortex, and stir up
no more than a natural Sleep; the Pulse, Respiration, Concoction, and
Separation of Humurs being performed after their wonted Custom. But if it be
given in too great a Dose, it imposes more strong Chains on the Spirits of the
Brain and its Appendix; and if the Dose be yet greater; it inlarges its
Narcotick Force, even to the Cerebellum, whereby the Appetite is destroyed,
Respiration very much straightened, the Pulse fails, as also the motion of the
Heart; so that there happens as it were an Eclipse of all the Faculties, a cold
Sweat and a perpetual Sleep, whereby the motion of the Heart quite ceasing, the
vital flame is extinguished.

13. It remains now that we enquire into the good effects of Opiates, and how
they may be given to the Safety and Benefit of Humane Life. As to their good
Effects, they are either on the Animal Spirits, or on the Blood, or in the
Humors; the former are indeed first or more immediately affected; the other
only secondarily, and by means of the affected Spirits. And indeed Opiates
seasonably, and in just dose administered, in the too great and irregular
motions of the Animal Spirits, may bring notable Relief; as also in faults of
the Internal Senses, which are Watchings and Delirium; and in Vices of the
External, the chief of which is pain. Now the Irregularitis which Narcoticks
rectify, are violent and too swift Pulse, Convulsions of the Praecordia or
Viscera, and the too violent and excessive Excretions of these; so there are
many and diverse cases, in which, whilst the Animal Spirits like fierce and
furious Horses, run about, or leap beyond their Bounds; they ought to be
reduced or restrained by Opiates, as it were with Bridles.

14. That they help against unnatural Watchings, Experience has confirmed; and
the reason is known Philosophically from the cause of want of Sleep: which is
chiefly from the Animal Spirits, being carried too much forth, and being of
themselves unquiet, whereby they blow up, and irradiate both the sensory
Organs, and possess especially the outmost Border of the Brain, or the Cortex
so called; where the Opiatick Particles being carried, either by the passage of
the Blood, or otherwise, do forthwith destroy or profligate those watchful
Spirits, and make those which are next to them, to fly more inwardly, whence
Sense and Motion being in some measure hurt, and the Spirits kept from their
Emanation, a Dullness and Drowsiness presently seizes, and immediately after
that, a sweet and pleasant Sleep.

15. In a Delirium, an Opiate is for the most part given with good Success
(though sometimes they may hurt also:) For when the Spirits are too much stirred
up within the Brain (by the force of any other cause) and struck as it were
with a Fury, they fly beyond their wonted Bounds and Passages; then the Opiate
approaching toward the Cortex of the Brain, represses them, and stops them a
little while from their Motion, and this as oftentimes as it is repeated, till
at length the Spirits return into their ancient Channels, and rightly perform
their Duties.

16. For easing all manner of Pains whatsoever, Opiates may deservedly be
called Nepenthe, and are truly a kind of Divine Remedy; insomuch as we can
scarcely enough admire how an almost intolerable pain, whether in any Member,
or in the Viscera, is, as it were by Enchantment, of a sudden taken away, or
made at present to cease, by the taking of a very small Dose of these Remedies,
yea sometimes without Sleep, or at least before Sleep comes: And it is yet more
stupendous, that whilst the Opiatick Particles do continue to operate, and
sometimes a little after Sleep is ended, that there is a high Alleviation, and
Freedom from Pain in the part afflicted, which ease continues, till the Force
of the Medicine is spent, after which the pain returns again as before: now in
the Opiates casing of pain, the Question is, by what means or artifice it does
it, whether its Narcotick Power is employed on the afflicted part, or on the
common Sensory, or on the whole sensible Soul?

17. The reason of the Difference of the former Proposition is, because pain
being excited in one place, is felt in another, and its effect is poured forth
through the whole sensitive Soul: Now the Production of Pain consists in this,
that the Nervous Fibers are irritated very much, and pulled one from another,
by some incongruous and greatly unproportionate thing, so that the Spirits
abounding in them, are by and by distracted; and put into confusion, by being
snatched from their equal expansion. But the Sense of the pain is caused by a
certain Undulation of the Spirits, through the Nervous Passages of the Common
Sensory; which sort of affection still proceeding even to the middle of the
Brain, stirrs up the Imagination, from whence being presently reflected through
the whole Hypostasis of the Spirits, diffuses that certain Disaffection and
Inquietude.

18. Hence it is, that as often as Opiates induce Sleep, an Analesia, or
Cessation of pain presently follows. For the Spirits which actuate the first
Sensory, are by the Opiatick Particles also bound with the Spirits inhabiting
the Brain; for which cause, although the paining part be irritated, yet the
sense of all pain is inhibited. But now when the Sick awakes, that he should
continue free from pain for many hours, become lively, and exercise exquisitely
all the Animal Functions, till the strength of the Medicine is spent; and then
the Pain presently to return again, according to its old Exorbitancy, is a
thing worthy to be enquired into.

19. For the solving of this Question, we think not that the Spirits of the
grieved part, nor those of the common Sensory, either singly; or both, are
bound by the force of the Opiate, it cannot be believed its Particles could
penetrate so deeply as to enter into the Brain and Nervous Stock, and in so
short a time descend to the part afflicted, suppose a Finger or Toe. Since
therefore the Analesia, or Cessation of Pain after Sleep for some Hours can be
referred neither to the grieving part, nor to the First Sensory, stupefied by
the Opiate; let us see how the reason of this may be deduced from a certain
Narcotick Affection of the whole Sensitive Soul.

20. First, it is necessary absolutely for the stirring up, or continuing of
any Pain, that there be a great plenty of Spirits abounding in the part
afflicted. For their mutual Allision, or beating one against another (causing a
Distraction and Excandescency) is the conjunct Cause of all Pain: Wherefore, if
there be a calling back of the Afflux of Spirits into the Brain, to supply the
place of those which are destroyed or prostigated by the Powers of the Opiate,
or to help to maintain the Contest with the Opiatick Particles; it follows,
that the Pain must necessarily cease, and so long, till the part pained is
supplied again with such an Afflux of tumultuating Spirits, which cannot be
done by the Spirits in the adjacent Fibers: For they lie so thinly dispersed
every where, that they scarcely touch one another.

21. Now this withdrawing of Spirits here necessary for the causing an
Analesia, or Cessation from Pain, can be produced by no other Remedys
whatsoever, but only by Opiates: For truly not only the outmost, and as it were
percursory Spirits, are destroyed by the Opiatick Particles encompassing the
Borders of the (...), but the first springing forth of these Spirits, within
the Brain or Cerebellum, and for that cause, their Efflux upon the Nervous
Stock, are forthwith greatly suppressed; so that during the Power and Force of
the Opiate, they are much more sparingly dispensed; and yet less into the
Praecordia, Viscera, and all other Extreme Parts.

22. Hence it is, that the Pulse and Breathing, do remit of their Vehemence and
Quickness, even because of the suppression of the Afflux of Spirits from their
generative Fountain, by the said Opiatick Particles: Hence also an unwonted
Languor and Slothfulness comes upon all the Members and Limbs. Hence also
Opiates take away Convulsions. And from hence the Viscera being before provoked
(into excretory Convulsions) by Vomit or Stool, or Vehemecy of Pain, as in the
Cholick or Gravel and Stone in the Reins or Bladder, find their Analesia or
Cessation of Pain: For whilst a plentiful Afflux and Supplement of Spirits are
wanting in the part afflicted, the few remaining can be no longer tumultuous
and angry; but rather lie at quiet, that they may subsist and maintain
themselves. So also in the Scorbutic Cholick, Opiates seem as it were a
certain kind of Exorcism: They also bring certain ease in the Gout and Stone,
whether in the Reins or Bladder as aforesaid. In Gout Pains, they have been an
egregious, and as it were a Divine Succor; and have given Ease when all other
things have failed, yea, where the Disease has been incurable. In this case, I
have persuaded some to the constant use of this Panacaea, to wit, Landanum,
which they have done with great comfort of Life, and without the least hurt,
although they increased its Dose by degrees to a very great quantity.

23. Now afterward, when the Sulpburous Particles of the Opiate are scattered
or blown away, the stock of Spirits within the (...), and their Emanation from
thence on the Nervous parts is renewed, so that they may descend again to the
parts afflicted in a full Stream, and fill full again their Fibers: Forthwith
by reason of the Spirits being again accumulated and stirred up as before, the
same Convulsions or Pains return. And without doubt, by this means, and
according to these reasons now assigned do Opiates quiet the strongest pains,
and procure an Analesia or Indolency, with, or without Sleep, for some
determinate time, as aforementioned.

24. How Opiates help the Irregularities of the motive faculty, we now come to
declare. These Irregularities have chiefly a respect to the Praecordia and
Viscera. To the First, ought to be referred the Pulse and Breathing; To the
Later, Excretory Convulsions. When the Motions of the Heart and Lungs in
Fevers, is so rapid, as to hasten vehemently the Circulation of of the Blood;
it is then hurt both as to its Accension, and depraved as to its Crasis, in
that it cannot separate its Superfluities and Filth, for want of a perfect
Concoction. In this case Opiates break the Impetuosity of this motion, whereby
the intense Heat is lessened, from whence the Circulation is gently and
temperately performed; and they also loosen the Blood in its joynting, whereby
it sends forth its Serum and Defilements both by Sweat and Urine.

25. How Opiates quiet this motion of the Heart, we have already above plainly
enough declared, to wit, by depressing the Action of the Pulse: For that the
Opiatick particles do somewhat stop the Springs of the Animal Spirits in the
Cerebellum, and diminish their Emanation or Efflux, from thence destinated to
the nervous Praecordia, which if it should happen to be too much (from too
large a Dose of the Optate) then follows a great Dejection of the Vital
Faculties, and sometimes Death it self.

26. Not in a much differing manner do Opiates quiet the too vehement Motion of
the Lungs, to wit, by regulating the Inordinations of the Respiration or
Breathing, whether it be interrupted, convulsive, or otherwise disturbed. They
help above all things in a vehement and continual Cough. In Asthmatick
Paroxysms (where the Sick seems to be in the very Agony of Death it self;) a
fit Dose of an Opiate renders (as it were) unexpectedly all things presently
serene and quiet. In a Pleurisy also, (chiefly in its beginning) they exert
their Power in full as large a measure.

27 The reason whereof is, that forasmuch as in these kinds of Affections,
troubling chiefly the Vital parts, the Spirits dwelling in them being highly
irritated, break forth into vehement and cruel Excandescencies, where, by their
violent Motions, they disturb and invert all things; the Opiate being now
taken, its Narcotick Sulphur beginning to act, immediately draws away the
Succors of those raving Spirits, and forthwith stops the Afflux of new; whereby
they being in a manner extenuated, and without fresh Supply, lay down their
Inordinations.

28. How Opiates help the immoderate or convulsive Motions of the Viseera, to
wit, of the Ventricle and Intestines, chiefly in horrid Vomitings, and
dysenterick or violent Purgings, is now our present Task: For that these
Affections can scarcely be cured without the use of Opiates. Now Opiates
perform not these things by fixing the fervescent and corrosive Humors of the
Party; but partly by stupifying the Nervous Fibers by a mere Contact, whereby
the Spirits implanted within the Cavities of the Viscera, are, as it were
benumbed; and partly by suppressing the Efflux of Spirits within the Cerebellum
to those parts; whereby, becoming destitute of help and supplies, they
forthwith lay aside their Convulsive Excandescencies.

29. In the Blood and Humors, Opiates have an apparent Operation in Catarrhs
and Defluxions of every kind, we fly oftentimes to these, as to the last
refuge; they strongly stay Bloody Excretions, also restrain the serous, when
they are excessive, and colliquative or melting; or reduce their Inordinations;
they repress the immoderate Ebullition of the Blood growing Feverish, and
lessen its too great Inflammation. Lastly, they happily stop all Fluxes arising
from what cause soever, and induce an Halcyon or most calm State to the Blood
however disturbed.

30. How these sorts of Effects are for the most part produced, we have already
hinted, to wit, through the mediating affections of the Animal Spirits: For the
Nervous Fibers being inordinately contracted, do agitate the Blood and Humors,
compelling them into div^^s Fluctuations and Disorders; which being taken away
by the Exhibition of Opiates, they presently become smooth and quiet. But yet
it seems, that they operate also another way; For the Opiatick Particles being
poured into the Blood, do cause certain Alterations as to its Liquor, by their
mere Syncrasie or Commixion: For (as we said before) they are altogether
untameable, and immiscible, and Heterogenous to the Blood; yet they are not
Enemies to it, nor injurious to its Liquor.

31. And therefore Opiates may be accounted as it were Alexiterians of the same
sort, which being confused with the Blood, do suddenly, and as it were in a
Trice, and almost untouched, pass through its Mass; and by opening all the
Holes and Pores in the passage of the Sulpburous Particles, make a free and
open Passage for the Serum (in a kind of pleasing Sweat) whereby the said Serum
and other Superfluities, or Malignities closely bound or shut up, go forth of
themselves, or else by the said Sulphurous Particles are driven out before them.

32. Hence it appears, that Opium is not altogether undeservedly (as an
Alexipharmacon) put into the Compositions of the greatest Antidotes, as of
Diascordium, Mithridate, and Venice Treacle. Moreover, it is a Sign, that the
Particles of Opiates, are presently (after taken) carried into the Blood, and
swiftly pass through its Mass; For that they are so suddenly carried to the
(...), and so procure Sleep and Ease.

33. Also it appears by common Experience, that Opiates procure Sweat and
Urine, which also are accoundated as some of their particular Virtues: whereby
it is clear, that their Particles are not venomous to the Blood, but rather
Alexiterian or resisting Poison, which is also more manifest from hence, for
that Laudanum is oftentimes administered with great Success in the Small Pox,
malignant Fevers, yea, the Plague it self; as also in several other Diseases.
In which cases, or in any other, we see not those qualities which some ascribe
thereto, of fixing and thickening the Blood, unless by unlocking its joyntings,
it causes its Serosities to be plentifully separated and sent away by Sweat and
Urine, whereby it may be said to become thicker and more compact.

34. We have little more to say concerning Opiates in general, save to give you
a few Cautions in their Exhibition. Before an Opiate is given, you ought to
consider, First, the Constitution of the Sick. Secondly, the Kind or Quality of
the Disease. Thirdly, the State of the Animal Spirits, in respect both to the
Animal and Vital Faculties. Fourthly, the State or Condition of the Blood and
Humors.

35. First, As to the Constitution, or Temperament of the Patient, see that the
habit of the Body, Indisposition, Custom, or kind of Living do not forbid
their Use. You may give them to such as are of a moderate Stature, strong, or
firm Body, well set, have a hot Blood, are commonly soluble in their Bellies,
and have a quick or lively Aspect; and much more securely, if they have been
before accustomed to use them. But they ought to be forbid den to such as are
too fat, or too lean, have a cold Temperament, soft and flaccid Flesh, have a
rare Texture of Body, and Spirits easily dissipable, and for the most part
bound in their Bodies, and are of a sleepy, dull, and sluggish Nature; and more
especially, if they never had taken an Opiate before.

36. Secondly, As to the Kind or Quality of the Disease, Opiates ought to be
interdicted in all the more light Affections, and in the Palsy, Vertigo,
Incubus, Apoplexy, Orthopnea, (or straitness of the Lights) Dropsy of the
Breast, Ascites, Stupor, (or trembling of the Members) and in very malignant
Fevers, in the Paroxysms of intermitting Fevers, and in the Crises of other
Fevers: Also in the Asthma, and other Disaffections of the Thorax, Oppression
of the Lungs, in Hysteric and other convulsive Passions, you are to give them
rarely, and not without great Caution and Consideration. But in vehement
Head-achs, Catarrhs, Cholicks, Fluxes, the Pleurisy, ordinary Fevers, in
Vomiting, Dysentery, Nephritick Paroxisms, in Gouts, Stitches of the Side, and
all kind of Pains, Opiates may be lawfully exhibited, as the only, and as it
were Divine Panacaea.

37. Thirdly, As to the state of the Animal Spirits, Optates are not to be
given when they are already few, or oppressed, or do not enough expand
themselves; or whilst the Animal Faculties, as to the Senses, are not very
vigorous, or do not enough exert themselves; or when the Pulse and Respiration
are by turns reciprocally weak, or are stopped, or unequal, or more quick or
slow than usual; or if a Stupor, or Enervation, with unaccustomed Languishing,
possesses the extreme and motive parts. But if any vehement and painful Disease
afflict; if the Animal Spirits in all their Dominions are robust and strong: or
are also too much expanded, or enlarged, or carried forth above measure; or
lastly, that they become fierce and unruly, Optates may be safely made use of,
with the hopes of exceeding good Success.

38. Fourthly, as to the State of the Blood and Humors; and first as to the
Blood, which we are to consider in respect to its Quantity or its Quality: As
to the Quantity of the Blood, Opiates ought not to be given in a Plethora (if
there be such a thing which we intend in another place largely to discuss:)
whilst the Blood is turging and boiling up, as in a Fever, greatly distending
the Vessels, by which its Circulation is swiftly repeated, lest it should any
where st^gnate or overflow.

39. Nor ought they to be given where there is a defect or want of Blood, as
after large Blood lettings, great Haemorrhages, long Fastings, or continual
Sickness. In these cases the Heart endeavors its quick Circumagitation, working
with a very quick and nimble Pulse, as it were with double endeavors, lest that
its Fluor should be broken off, and so cease. What hurt then may Opiates do
here, which put a Remora, or Stop to this working of the Heart (so needful to
the Life of the Sick) as is apparent from their making the Pulse dull or slow,
or totally stopping of it. And for this reason it seems to be, that Sleep is
forbidden persons who have been newly let Blood; and that Sleep also is
forbidden to Women presently after Delivery, whilst the Lochia are flowing,
l^st the Spirits in the time of Sleep, being called back, should leave the
Heart, by which it drives about the diminished River of the Blood.

40. The Quality, Crasis, or Disposition of the Blood being hurt, forbids the
use of Opiates: For being stuffed with Recrements or Supersluities, as in a
Cacochymia, Dropsy, etc. it ought to be more swiftly circulated, that the
Heterogen^ous Particles might be overcome, and quickly expelled: This
Narco^icks hinder by stopping the endeavor of the Praecordia, (manifest in the
diminution of the Pulse) whereby the Lustration or Circulation of the Blood, is
either frustrated or retarded. But if they be given in so large a Dose as to
cause Sweat, this later Operation makes some amends for the hurt of the former,
because many of the said Heterogenous Particles are driven out through the
Pores of the Flesh and Skin.

41. Lastly, as to the Recrementitious Humors accumulated within the Stomach or
Guts, Opiates ought not to be given, till they are carried off, or purged out,
either by Vomit or Stool: otherwise being fixed there, they will stick the more
strongly; for that the splenetick Fibers, being, as it were, stupefied, are not
irritated as before, nor easily, or lively perform the excretory Convulsions,
for the expelling those superfluous Humors; wherefore (according to the old
rule (superfluous humors (if any) are first to be evacuated, before the
Administration of Opiates.

42. We will only give you one memorable History of an Opiatick Cure, from that
Learned Man, and so conclude this Theory. Some time past (says he) I was
advised with concerning a Gentleman very Cacochymick, or full of evil Humors,
and miserably vexed with Nocturnal Pains, arising from the Venereal Disease,
being not, or not well cured. I prescribed many things, but in vain; because
very much abhorring Medicines, he would yield to take nothing almost besides a
Dose of Laudanum. Shortly he became Hydropical from an Ascites and an Anasarca:
He swelled so much, that he could scarce move from one side to the other
without the help of Servants. In this Condition, I being at length sent for,
and finding him obstinate, because of his before taken Medicaments: I made a
Prognostic, that he was not far from Death; and that it was certainly to be
expected; therefore he should prepare himself and his Affairs for Eternity. He
not much disturbed, earnestly asked, that for his more easy dying, he might
take our Laudanum; (before, but sparingly permitted him) at his pleasure) or at
the least in the Evening. Granting it, with a certain Admonition, I left him,
and gave him, as I thought, the last Farewell, Afterward he took that Medicine
daily, and daily increased its Dose; so that in a short time, he had taken an
incredible quantity of it. By the use of this only Medicine, he grew better
every day; and within a Month space, was so well, that being free from all
Humors and Pains, he had got a Stomach, and went abroad. By the assiduous use
of this Opiate, his Thirst before troubling him went away; and being every
night put into a great Sweat, he also made plenty of Urine.

43. Hitherto of the Theoretick part of our Opiology; the Practick follows; the
which we will exactly delincate, according to the various Classes of the famous
Johannes Daniel Horstius, in his Pharmacopaeia Galeno-Chymica Catholica
Specialis, lib. 13. page 369. After which we will give you the exact Recipe of
Guttae Vitae nostrae, or our Drops of Life according to their twofold manner
of Preparation; which Medicine is now famously known throughout the three
Kingdoms for its manifold and adminable Virtues.

Galangal, Guajacum, Box, etc. To these may be added some compound Confects of
like Nature, as Mitridate, Venice-Treacle, Electuarium de Ovo, Diascordium,
etc. These being taken, awaken the Animal Spirits, by which the Praecordia
being more lively actuated, the Circulation of the Blood is performed the more
swiftly. They also go in and ferment the Blood in the stomachical Vessels, so
that whilst it circulates quicker back toward the heart; it is at the same
time more vehemently circulated forwards, through the arteries into the habit
of the Body, whence comes sweating.

74. Secondly, Simple Concreies of an Alchalisate and as it were fixed Salt.
Oriental Bezoar, Peals, Coral, Crabs-eys and Crabs-claws, Terra figillata,

etc. These by their alchizate Salt, sometimes meeting with an acid Salt, both
in the Viscera, and also in the Blood, and fermenting together, or growing hot,
cause the sanguinious Mass to be fused, and its serosities to be separated and
resolved into sweat. Of both these kinds of Sudorificks you may see a cloud in

IX. The Composition of Lapis Bezoarticus noster, or, Our Bezoartick Stone,
aforementioned, which is twofold.
First, For the Ordinary sort of People.
164. Terra sigillata, Viper powder, A viij. Extractum Bezoarticum dried, v, j.
dried Extracts of Contra yerva, of Virginian Snake-root, of Spicknard, of
Cloves, of Opium; Magistery of Pearls, Magistery of Coral, Grains of Kermes, A.
iv. Volatile Salt of Amber, Aurum Mosaicum, Saffron, Cochinel, Ambergrise,
Musk, Oriental Bezoar, Mineral Bezoar, A. ijss ss. Red Diaphoretick Mercury,
jss, gr. xij. Solar Bezoar, Camphir, A. j j. Purple Calx of Gold ijss. Oil of
Cinnamon ij. The ingredients being in fine Powder mix them; and with Gelly of
Vipers Skins q. s. make a Mass, which Work exceeding well together, and make it
up into little Oval Balls like small Eggs, weighing about ij or iij. a piece;
then dry them in a shady place, till they become hard like Stones.

In this Composition (setting aside the Gelly of Viper Skins) there is about x.
gr. ij. in Weight; containing about 192 Doses; so that each Dose weighs about
gr. xxv. and contains in it of Opium about gr. 1.. And j of the Compositum
contains just gr. j. of Opium; of the Perfumes, about one grain, and a third
part of a Grain: of the Diaphoretick Mercury, about 5/12. or almost half a
Grain: and of the Solar Bezoar, and of the Camphir, of each about the third
part of a Grain: and of the Purple Calx of Gold, about the fifth part of a
Grain, or somewhat more. Notwithstanding all which Proportions, the Medicament
has a very great Essicacy; and is also very Dear: but in a full Dose those
Proportions are somewhat larger; and after it is made up with the Gelly may be
given a gr.xv. ad ss. and in strong Bodies to ij: it Sweats powerfully. Now
here is to be understood (as in all other the like Cas^s) That many small or
minute things, of themselves inconsiderable, being conjoined, may make one
great thing, and that of mighty force. This is most apparent and demonstrable
in Gun-pouder, so much as will discharge a Musket, has a mighty intrinsic
force in it self; yet the particulars being unconjoyned, are very small things,
and of almost inconsiderable worth: the same understand of this Our Medicament.

Secondly, For the Gentry and Nobility, which for distinction sake, We call,
Bezoarticum Regale Nostrum, Our Royal Bezoartick.
165. Solar Bezoar, Purple Calx of Gold, A. viij. Ambergrise, Musk, Viper
powder, A. vj. Red Diaphoretick Mercury, Camphir, Oriental Bezoar, Bezoar
Minerale, Saffron, ^^chinele, Volatile Salt of Amber, dry extract of Thebian
Opium, A. iv: Grains of Kerines, Extractum Bezoarticum dried, dried Extracts of
Contra yerva, Virginian Snakeroot, of Spicknard, of Cloves, Oil of Cinnamon, A.
ii: Aurum Mosaicum, Terra Sigillata, A. j: The ingredients being in fine
Powder, with Gelly of Vipers Skins, q. s. make a Mass, which work exceeding
well together, and make it up into little Oval Balls like small Pigeons Eggs,
weighing about ij. a piece: dry them in a shady place, till they become hard
like S^^^es. If you add to the Mass fine leaf Gold in Powder iv. the Medicament
will be both more Glorious, and more Virtuous.

The whole of this Compositum (setting aside the Gelly of Vipers Skins) is x
iij, j: of which the Greatest Dose is 25 Grains; so that in all there is just
200 Doses. In each Dose of which there is contained, of the Solar Bezoar, and
Purple Calx of Gold, of each, almost gr.ijss: or about 2 ^ ^ grains: of the
Persumes and Viper Powder, of each almost one Grain and 3 quarters, or, 1
41/52. grains: of the Diaphoretick Mercury, Camphir, and Thebian Opium, etc. of
each almost a grain and a quarter, or about gr. 1 (...). by which it may
appear, That this much exceeds the former in Power and Virtue. After it is made
up with the Gelly, it may be given a gr.x. ad xxx. nearly: either in a Bolus,
or in some proper Vehicle, as the Sick likes best: It is a great Medicine, and
almost of Infinite Virtues. Given in the largest Dose it provokes Sweat
powerfully, and expels all manner of Poison and Malignity from the Heart,
whether it proceeds from the Biting or Stinging of any Venomous or Poisonous
Creature; Or, from the Contagion of any Epidemick or Malignant Disease, as the
Measles, Small-P^x, Calenture, Sweating-Sickness, malign Fevers, and Plague it
self. It mightily strengthens the Heart, revives all the Spirits, Natural,
Vital, and Animal, and fortifies the whole entire Man to a Wonder: it is
extreme good against melancholy, melts frigid, clammy, and viscous humors, and
thereby opens obstructions, prevails against affects of the Spleen, and
Hypochenders, and discontent of Mind; it is a singular good thing against the
Scurvy, whether in a bot or cold Constitution, as also against the Leprosy,
taking away Scabs, Scurff, Itch, Tettars, Ringworms, Morphew, Boyls, etc. by
loosening the too strickt joynting of the Blood from a Comblnation of acid or
fixed Salts, with Sulphurous Particles, whereby causing a new Fermentation, it
separates the Recrements and Impurities thereof through the Pores of the Skin,
and sweetens it. It is a most excellent thing in all Burning, Continent; or
Continual Fevers, for it interfers immediately with their original Cause. It
destroys the very Essence of Venoms, gives rest and ease, and takes away all
manner of pains in any part of the Body. It is good against Catarrhs, and stops
all forts of Distillations (whether thin, sharp, or salt) falling from the Head
upon the Throat and Aspera Arteria: It helps vehement Coughs, expectorates,
quenches Thirst, cools Inflammations, eases the most acute pains, as those of
the Cholick, Stone, Pleurisy, Gout, etc. and is good in all Fluxes of the
Bowels, Womb, etc. It is eminent against Palpitations, Swooning, Trembling, and
other Passions of the Heart, sickness of the Stomach, Wind, want of Appetite
and Indigestion: It is good against Gravel, Slime, or any thing making a
Stoppage of the Urine, whether in the Reins or Bladder; it provokes Urine,
takes away the heat and sharpness thereof, cures the Disuria, Ischuria and
Stranguria, and is profitable for such as are troubled with Weaknesses, or
languish under Hecticks, Consumptions, Poison, etc. You may give it in a Bolus,
made with a Conserve of Red Roses, or of Wood Sorrel, and Drink after it a
Glass of Tent, Alicant, or Canary. It is a specific almost in all Diseases,
which may befall the Head, Brain, or Nerves, for that it miraculously
strengthens those parts, and recreates the Animal Spirits. It is also
profitable for Women in Labor, for it expels both Birth and Afterbirth; and
after Delivery, it stupendiously takes away all the After-pains. Both the
Prescripts have like Virtues, but the latter is the more effectual by many
degrees.

Examples in Compounding Diuretics.
All the matter of all sorts of Solutions and Precipitations depends only upon
the affections of Salts. And as the Blood and Humors abound very much in Salt,
and are wont to be variously changed by it from one state to another, causing a
sickly disposition; so there will be always need of great Discretion and
Judgment in the Physician, to administer such Saline Diuretics, whose
Particles may sufficiently differ from those in Our Bodies, whereby Health may
be recovered again. The which by what means this may be done, we shall the
easilier Judge by running over the Diuretic Salts of every kind.
I. Diuretics whose Basis is an Alcalisate Salt.
It is evident that Alchalizate Salts do sometimes move Urine. For in great
stoppages of the Water, Powder of Eggshells, or of Crabs Claws or Eyes, have to
some been a present Remedy. The reason of which is this, For that they do not
fuse or scatter, nor sensibly praecipitate the Blood. Hence it appears, That
these kinds of Salts, are to be given in an Acetous Discrasy of the Blood and
Humors; for that they bind up the acid Salts by their Combination, freeing the
Blood from Fluxions and Coagulations, that thereby it might be strengthened to
retain its superfluous Serum to transfer it by the Emulgent Arteries to the
Reins.

166. Salt of Tartar ss. Crabs Eyes levigated j. mix them.

167. Gascoin Powder jss. Salt of Amber, Sal Prunellae, A. ij. Salt of Tartar,
Nutmegs, A. j. mix in a fine Powder. Dose j ad ss.

171. Calx of Eggshells ss. Gascoin Powder j. Eggshell laevigated ss. Salt of
Tartar gr. vj. Nutmegs, Cloves, A. gr. ij. all being in fine Powder, make them
into Pills with Venice Turpentine for a Dose.

172. Egg-shels laevigated ss. Salt of Broom j. make a Bolus with Turpentine.

II. Diuretics whose Basis is a Volatile Salt.
These are commonly used to provoke Urine in a sharp Discrasy of the Blood, for
that their Particles being admitted into the Blood do destroy the Potency of
the fluid Salt therein, whereby the Blood recovering a due mixture is freed
from Coagulations, and sucks up again into it self whatsoever of the Serum is
gone forth of the Vessels, and delivers the superfluous to the Reins, etc.
These have Particles fierce and elastick, so that in amending the evil
disposition of the Blood; they sometimes dispose the superfluous Serum to be
taken away by Diaphoresis or Sweat, as well as by a Diuresis, or purging by
Urine. To this Classis belongs the Volatile Salt of Animals and Minerals made
by Distillation; as also the integral parts of the living Creatures and
Vegetables, as Vipers, Bees, Millepedes, Grass-hoppers, Cantharides,
Earthworms, etc. Mustardseed, Scurvy Grass, Horseradish, Cresses of all sorts,
Crow-foot, Onions, Garlic, Leeks, Chervil, Parsley, Alexanders, etc.

188. Volatile Salts of Millepedes, of Vipers, of Urine, A. gr. vij ad jx: mix
them.

III. Diuretics whose Basis is a fixed Salt, or Lixivial.
These are commonly given to move Vrin in such as have Dropsies, chiefly in an
Anasarca, and in an Ascites: So a Lixivium made of the Ashes of Wormwood, or
Broom or Bean-stalks in Water, or Whitewine, and given causes a plentiful flux
of Urine, whereby those diseases are oftentimes taken away: but this has not
succeeded in all persons, for, in some, we have found upon the taking of these
things, an Ascitis to have been increased, the reason we have in another place
in part declared: however it is certain, That the Lixivial Sals do not fuse nor
praecipitate either Milk or Blood, and therefore they are not by their proper
Virtue dinretick, but seem to be influenced in that kind only when they meet
with a mighty Acid or Coagulative Salt in the Blood, where by encountering and
destroying its Energy, it causes the Blood (fused by the acid, and so made
unable to hold its Serum) to suck up the said extravased serosities, and so to
recover its due Consistency, by which continually carrying it to the Reins
there is made a large Evacuation by Urine.

189. Vine ashes vj: white or Rhenish wine lbijss: Nutmegs bruised ij ss:
infuse close and warm 24 hours, then strain: dose vj: twice or thrice a day.

A. ss: Coral calcined white, iss: Salt of Amber, Nutmegs, A. ss: make all into
a powder: dose ss ad jj, in white or Rhenish Wine.

IV. Diuretics whose Basis is an Acid Salt.
Acid Salts fuse the Blood, and praecipitate it into Serosities, even as sharp
or sour things do Milk, being dropped into it warm: but this happens not alike in
every one, nor to every one indifferently. In a healthful habit, or what is
near it, the blood is replenished with a Salt partly fixed, partly volatile,
and partly nitrous: but in some scorbutical and hydropical Persons, it is
filled with a Salt chiefly fixed: Inthese Cases Acid diuretics are given with
Success: But in other Scorbutical and hydropical persons, as also in Catarrs
and Rhumatisms, where the said Salt of the Blood is only and wholly fixed, and
the Volatile totally depressed, they are thought rather to do hurt; in this
Case Medicines endued with a Volatile Salt are more proper. Among acid
Diuretics, Spirits of Salt, of Niter, of Vitriol, of Sulphur; as also juyces
of Citrons, of Limons, of Oranges of Sorrel, White and Rhenish wine, Cider,
Cremor Tartari and Tartar Vitriolate are Chief.

209. spirit of Salt ii: Hartshorn burnt and poudred, so much as may drink it
up, and make a Powder: Dose i ad ss. in a fit Vehicle.

210. Oil of Vitriol or Sulphur ss: Hartshorn calcined, as aforesaid, q.s. mix
and make a Powder, with which mix Nutmegs in Powder iij. Dose i ad ss.

V. Diuretics whose Basis is a Nitrous Salt.
Niter is a Salt, which is neither acid, nor fixed, nor volatile, having a kind
as it were of Neutral Property, or a middle or a central State between them. So
much it has of a Volatile, as being melted and inflamed by Sulphur cast in, it
will by and by, or in no longer time fly away. So much it has of a fixed, as
being melted in a Crucible, that it will suffer a continual Fusion, and perhaps
perpetual, without any great loss of Particles. And so much it has of an acid,
as being distilled (its spirit being rather flame than vapor) comes acid into
the Receiver. Niter is the flame whereby all sublinary Fire is enkindled and
sustained, that by which all Plants do grow and flourish, and by which all
living Creatures live and breath. It cools the Blood notably, and as strongly
moves Urine, yet all its Particles are so far from being cold, that on the
contrary nothing can be more igniferous, this is a Parodox whose reason out to
be sought out, the which we shall do in some other place, we cannot attend it
here. However it is clear, that Niter has Relation both to a fixed and volatile
Salt; for it, being put into Milk, will even (as fixed and volatile Salts) keep
it from, or take way its Coagulation: in like manner being put into warm Blood,
it will preserve it (as well as they) from Coagulation, and discoloration: from
whence we conclude, that the Particles of Niter being taken inwardly, may keep,
or restore the just mixtion of the Blood, for that they hinder its Fusions and
Coagulations, by making the flame of the Blood to burn more pure and clear, and
freeing it from troublesome, heterogenous sulphurous Fumes, and suffocating
Vapors, so that being more loose from its close joyntings; its Serum is the
more easily extricated from it, in the emulgent Arteries, and so sent away by
the Reins through the Vrinary passages.

211. Sal Prunellae ss ad ii or i: White Wine viij: Syrup of Pellitory of the
Wall iss: mix for a dose: it is an admirable thing in a Dropsy, and in all
stoppages of Urine.

212. Sal Prunellae ss ad i: Spring Water iiii: Syrup of Pellitory i: mix.

213. Sal Prunellae ss ad i: Infusions of Onions sliced in White or Rhenish
Wine vj: Syrup of Pellitory of the Wall, or of Marshmallows iss: mix for a
Dose.

214. Sal Prunellae ss ad i: Salt of Amber ss: White Wine iiii ad vi: Syrup of
Pellitory of the Wall i: mix for a Dose.

215. Sal Prunellae j ad ij: Salt of Amber ss ad j: Saffron gr. v: White or
Rhenish Wine q. s. mix for a Dose, and sweeten them well with Syrup of
Pellitory of the Wall.

216. Sal Prunellae iii: Salt of Amber ii: Salt of Wormwood ss: mix them: Dose
ss: thrice a Day in White or Rhenish Wine, sweetened with Syrup of Pellitory.

Night.

220. Sal Prunellae ss: Volatile Salt of Hartshorn gr.xv: Infusion of Onions
sliced in White or Rhenish Wine vij: Syrup of Pellitory of the Wall ii: mix it
for a Dose, to be given in the Morning fasting.

VI. Diuretics whose Basis is sulpherous or spirituous.
Of this kind there are several; some of which are Resinous: as Turpentine,
Balsams of Peru, Tolu, Gillead, and Preparations out of them. Some Oleaginous;
as Oils of Juniper Berries, Carraways, of Nutmegs, of Wax, and drops of other
Fat things, most of which being taken inwardly, cause the Urine to smell like
Violets. Some Spirituous; as Spirit of Wine, spirit of Juniper Berries, Radish
Water Compound, with many other hot Waters; yea and strong Wines drank
plentifully, which in Hydropick and cold Scorbutic people happily produce a
Diuresis. The cause is from the Sowrness of the Blood, its want of Spirits,
defect of Fermentation, or strength of the acid and coagulative Salt, whereby
the Blood is so weakened as not to perform well its Circulation, nor to contain
within it self its superfluous Serosities, till it can carry them to the Reins;
which defects, all the aforenamed Remedies take away, by heating, and
enlivening the Blood, and restoring its weakness by adding spirits thereto,
whereby it is able to keep its whole mixtion entire, so that ariving perfect by
the Emulgent Arteries, it lets go its Serum, and so provokes a plentiful and
pleasant Diuresis.

221: S.V. lbviij: large Onions bruises, Garlic bruised, A. lbj: Mustard Seed
iiii: mix and distill to dryness. Dose ij, twice or thrice a day.

222. S.V. lbiiii: large Oni^^s, Jan^per-berries both (...) A. lbss: Nutmegs

have a notable diuretic power.

224. Juniper Berries (gently and thoroughly dried in an Oven, and reduced into
a gross Powder lbi: S V. rectified, so as it may fire Gun-pouder lbiijss:
digest cold three or four days, then distill in B. M. to dryness. Dose ij, iij,

iv: Nutmegs ij: bruise all, and put them into a glass Retort, upon which assuse
S.V. rectified lbiiii: and adding thereto the best Venice Turpentine lbi: let
them be distilled in a Sand Furnace with a gentle heat ( in my opinion a gentle
B. M. would be better,) having a care of an Empyruma; so have you a Spirit and

CHAP. XXIV. How to make the Strong Water which the Distillers of London sell
in their Shops.
IT is not unfit for a Chemist, or any Lover of Art to know how these are made;
and being but about XXXV in number, besides the making of Vinegar, We thought
good to place them here.

1. To make strong Proof Spirit.

twenty quarters, or one hundred and sixty Bushels of good found Malt, convert
it into one hundred Barrels of good serviceable Ware, allowing to this quantity
at most but lblvj, of good sweet Hops. And being well wrought according to Art,
put it into sweet Casks (sweet Oil Buts are best) fill them within eight Inches
of the Bungs, (being laid upon Scantlings in the Sun) let not the Head or Yest,
Work over at the Bungs, and it will sink to the bottom: prepare little Covers
of Wood, fit to cover the Bungs, and larger Covers to lay over them, to defend
them from R^in falling into the Casks. Let the Bungs stand open only, when the
Sun shines hot upon the Cask; but in close or wet Weather, and in the Night,
let both Covers be always kept on. When the first Head of the Liquor is fallen
in, then draw it from the Lee, into another clean sweet Cask, and so afterward
from Cask to Cask, as there shall be cause, till it comes to perfection; then
draw it ^ff into another sound Cask (the largest are sit for this purpose)
and so keep it in your Warehouse for use. If this Ware should grow long and
ropy, then put a sit quantity of Alum into it, Work it well together according
to Art, and it will grow short again. Then take of this Ware or Drink, q. s.
put it into a Copper Alembick (which if Tin'd within will be so much the
better) with its Worm, and distill off a Proof Spirit according to Art, which as
you see necessary you may make more perfect by a Redistillation.

After this manner ought the true Proof Spirit to be made: formerly it was
Distilled from Brewers Afterworts, or Wash, called Blew John: But the Company
of Distillers of London, have made this Order, That no Afterworts or Wash, made
by Brewers, called Blew John, nor Musty, Unsavory, or Unwholesome Tilts, or
Dregs of Beer or Ale; nor Unwholesome or Adulterated Wines, or Lees of Wines;
nor Unwholesome Sugar- Waters, Musty, Unsavory, or Unwholesome returned Beer or
Ale; nor Rotten, Corrupt, or Unsavory Fruits or Drugs, Spices, Herbs, Seeds,
nor any other ill conditioned Materials, of what kind so ever, shall henceforth
be Distilled, Extracted, or drawn into small Spiri^s or low Wines, or be any
otherwise used, Directly or Indirectly, by any the Members of this Company, or
their Successors, at any time hereafter for ever. And that no small Spirits, or
low Wines shall be Distilled, Extracted or Made, or be allowed to be Sold, or
put to Sale, or used by any of the Members of the Company, or their Successors;
but such only, as out of which, by one alone Re-distillation, Extraction, or
Operation, may be produced in quantity at least one third part thereof, of good
strong Proof Spirit, such as is produced by the aforesaid Recipe, for the
making of Rich or High Spirits, Strong Water, or Aqua Vitae, etc. Note, That
unless, you Distill gently, it will make the Head of the Alembick to fly up. If
this Water be Distilled three, four, or more several times, you may have as
strong a Spirit as out of Wine, between which there will be but little
difference.

2. To make Aqua Vitae Common.

Take strong Proof Spirit one Gallon, Annisceds bruised jss: distill them into a
strong Proof spirit, according to Art.

You may make this Water Richer, if you take Clovegilliflowers, Red Roses,

quantity, and infuse them in Aqua Vitae, or Proof Spirit, till the Tincture is
drawn out, then to draw off the Spirit, and to keep it for use; and upon
occasion to take viij thereof, to lbvijss, of this Water; by which also it will
have a good Color; you may use a greater quantity of this Spirit without any
inconveniency.

It is a good Stomatick, and comforts the Ventricle weakened by Surfeits, or
other Distempers. The Syrup of Fruits is thus made. Take Apricocks, Quinces,
Cherries, English Currants, A. q. s. all full ripe: Prpeare the Quinces and
Apricocks, and take out the Stones and Kernels, and slice them very thin: Stone
the Cherries, and bruise them and the Currants; then lay them into a flat Basin
or Pan, thus: a Lane of Fruit of a fingers thickness: and then a lay of white
powder Sugar, of the same thickness: and so proceed in Order stratum super
stratum, or lay upon lay, till all be laid into the Basin: then pour on good
Aqua Vitae gently, till all be covered therewith, and so let it stand two,
three, or four hours. After bruise or mash them all together, and press out the
juice as dry as possible may be, through a thick Linen or Hair Bag. This
expressed juice take, and let it stand, till it is clear settled; which by a
gentle heat in a hot Bath, evaporate or boil up to the thickness of a Syrup,
and so keep it for the use aforesaid: one pound hereof dulcifies eight pounds
of the Spirit.

35. To make Avens- Water.

strong proof spirit lb viij Avens roots vj iij gr. xv: Orrice roots, Nutmegs,

all that are to be bruised, distill them into proof spirit, according to Art,
and dulcify with Syrup of Alkermes, xvi, or more.

This is a great Cordial, strengthens the Heart and Spirits, and indeed the
Universal Frame, and confirms the healthful tone of the Viscera: It removes
Sadness and Melancholy, and restores in Consumptions. Syrup of Alkermes is thus
made: Rose water lb j: white Sugar lb ij ss: Boil to a Syrup, strain, and put
it to the fire again; then add Confection of Alkermes, j: Syrup of
Clovegilleflowers iv: Ambergrise (dissolved in Rosewater) gr. xv. let these
boil a little, till they are incorporated with the Syrup, and so keep it for
use: lbj hereof dulcisies lb viij of Spirit.

36. To make the best Vinegar.

You must have 3 sweet Tuns (or smaller Casks) place them orderly on
scantlings; provide good sound white Rape, and such well conditioned, or sound
and good materials as are proper for this Use, so much as suffices: not Musty
in any case: Number your Tuns 1, 2, 3, Fill the first Tun with Rape, within six
Inches of the Bung; stop the Bung with Cork or Wood very close, and let it
stand, and in a few days it will gather heat: being conveniently hot, fill up
the Vessel within three Inches of Top-full with your Liquid Materials without
Dregs; stop it close again. At that Instant fill the second Tun with Rape, as
aforesaid; after a few days it will be hot as the former was: being
conveniently hot, draw off Tun, 1. and put it into Tun 2. and stop both close.
At that Instant fill the third Tun with Rape, ordering it in every respect as
the former: when Tuns 1. and 3, have gathred sufficient heat, sill up Tun 1.
with fresh Liquor, as at the first; and draw off Tun 2. and put it into Tun 3.
and so let Tun 2. gather sufficient heat again: Then draw off Tun 1. and put it
into Tun 2: at that Instant, draw off Tun 3. and put it into a stone Cask, for
having passed three times through the Rape, it is become good and merchantable
Ware. In this Order, you must supply one Vessel from another, till you have
finished your Work, according to Art.

Now here is to be noted, 1. That the liquid Materials which you shall use, are
chiefly French Wines or Rhenish, or such Good and Merchantable Ware made of
good Malt, as is directed at Sect. 1: of this Chapter: For the Company of
Distillers of London, have Ordered, That no Member, or Members of their
Company, or their Successors, nor any of them, at any time hereafter for ever,
by any way or means whatsoever, Directly or Indirectly, shall or may, Use,
Dispose, Convert, or Impioy any Afterworts, or Wash, (called Blew John) made by
Brewers or others into Vinegar, Beer-eager, or Aleeager, or either of them, as
they respect their Oaths by them taken, and will undergo the Penalties in this
Case provided. 2. That in Summer time, and warm Weather, the Rape will attain a
sufficient heat in two or three days: but in Winter it will require a longer
time. 3. That when all your liquid Materials are spent, so that you have no
more to continue your Work, you be sure, That your Tuns stand near full, till
you are provided of more Liquor to put upon the Rape. For if the Rape standing
dry, should Wax hot, and you have nothing proper to supply the same withal, it
would soon decay, and be perfectly spoiled; which if otherwise, it be
preserved, as aforesaid, will (as some possitively affirm) serve to make
Vinegar with for ever.

APPENDIX. I. Concerning the Preparing of Artificial Tunbridge and Epsome
Waters.
37. To make or prepare Tunbridge Water Artificial.

of the Mine or Our of Iron, q. s. beat it very small; put this into a little
Furnace made with a Grate, above which a strong Crucible must be fastened
resting on two Iron Bars; let it be so ordered, That the Smoke be conveyed not
above by the Crucible, but through a Pipe or passage at the side of the
Furnace: this Crucible fill with the said Iron Oar in Powder: and by a Coal
fire without flame cause Ignition, and so keep it, having before hand fitted
proper subliming Vessels: so will there come forth an acid Spirit and Flowers:
mix them together till the acid Spirits extracts a Salt out of the Flowers;
then decant off the clear Liquor, which will have a strong taste and smell of
Iron. A few drops of this Liquor, put into a Glass full of Fountain Water, will
give it the odor and taste of Tunbridge Water, and Communicate the same
Operations to it. Or thus. Take fair Spring Water lbiv: Salt, Crystals or
Vitriol of Mars j: mix, dissolve, and filter through Brown Paper, so have you a
Water in Virtues and effects like to that of Tunbridge.

It is certain that Tunbridg Water proceeds from an Iron Mine, whence it
contracts that Ironish, acid and vitriolick taste and odor, though upon
Evaporation, there remains little or no Salt or Vitriol of Iron at bottom. But
it contracts this Taste and Odor, either, 1. From washing away some of the
Dissoluble parts of the Mine. 2. Or by impregnating it self with the Volatile
parts of the said Mine raised in a Fermentation of the said Mineral, by mixion
with the Water. 3. Or by mixion of the Vapors (condensed into an acid Liquor
by the coldness of the Earth) arising from the aforesaid fermented Particles of
the Mine. 4. Or lastly, From a participation of all the aforesaid three. From
whence it comes to pass (the Particles of the Mine which the Water is
impregnated withal being mostly Volatile) that upon evaporation, little or
nothing of Salt or Vitriol is found remaining. This Artificial Liquor made the
first way, (and made moderately acid) may be taken from a pint to fix pints,
but by degrees, and also a little warm, or made into Posset, using moderate
Exercise after taking of it, and fasting till all the Water is gone out of the
Body, which will be in about five or six hours. This Artificial Liquor made the
second way may be taken from one pint to two or three at most, with
Observations, as aforesaid. These Waters open all Obstructions, purge by Urine,
cleanse the Kidney and Bladder, help the pissing of Blood, stoppage of Urine,
and difficulty of making Water: They allay all sharpnesses of Humors, cure
inward Ulcers and Aposthumes, cleanse and strengthen the Stomach, Liver,
Spleen, and Mesentery, and are prevalent against the Cachexia, Dropsy,
Jaundice, Green Sickness and Scurvy.

38. To make an Artificial Epsome-Water.

of the Mine of Alum, or Alum Stones, powder very small, and distill therefrom a
certain acid aluminish Water, which must be mixed with a double quantity of
Niter-Water, or Water of the Artificial Bath, made as we shall teach in lib. 3.
cap. 1. sect. 15. of this Work. With this mixture you shall make Fountain Water
a little acid; that it may resemble Epsome Water, which has an acid taste,
partly Aluminous, partly Nitrous, proceeding from a Nitrous Air, and Vapors
arising from the sermentation of the Aluminous Mine, mixed together, for that
Epsom Water (as is supposed) passes through an Alum Mine. A few drops of this
mixture, put into a glass of Fountain or Spring Water, will give it the odor
and taste of spring water, so that you shall scarcely discern them asunder,
either by taste, smell or Operation.

This Water is Purgative, and especially purges out all sharp Burning Humors;
cools an Inflamed, and opens an Obstructed Body; cleanses the Kidneys and
Bladder, cures inward Ulcers and Apostemes, prevails against a Cachexia, or
evil Habit and Disposition of the Body, and is good against a Consumption.
Fountain Water made acid with this Liquor, may be taken from one pint to six,
but by degrees, and a little warm, or the cold taken off; or, which is best of
all, in Posset Drink, using moderate Exercise after, and not eating till the
Water is out of the Body, except some warm Broth, or Mace-Ale, to help the
working thereof.

APPENDIX. II. Concerning Viper Wine and Hyppocras.
39. To make or prepare Viper Wine.

choice Canary lbviij: live Vipers No. vj, or more, according to their bigness:
s^ffocate the Adders in the Wine; then let the Wine pass a gentle fermentation,
and when it grows fine or clear, let it be drawn for use. Or thus. Canary
lbviij: live Vipers No. vj: suffocate the Vipers in the Wine, then take them
out, cut off their Heads, Skin them, and Vnbowel them, and then put them into
the said Wine as before. Or thus. Canary lbviij: Fat Vipers No. vj: cut off
their Heads, take off their Skins, and Vnbowel them, then put them into the
Sack: let them stand three, six, nine or twelve months, and draw off the Wine
as you drink it. Of these three ways, the first is by many accounted the best;
but every one may use that which pleases them best, or best agrees with their
Fantasy.

I chose to put the Viper-Wine (and that following) here, rather than in the
Chapter of Wines, or under the Considerations of that Animal; for as much as it
is a Liquor chiefly used to drink for Pleasure, or to Pamper the Lustful
desires of debauched persons in this extremely profane Age. It provokes very
much to Venery, cures Consumptions, and eradicates the Leprosy, and all other
Corruptions of the Blood. Dose ab j ad ij or ijss, once or twice a day, as
Morning and Night.

40. To make the Common Hypocras of the Shops.

Canary, White Wine or Claret lbxl: or gal. v: Musk, Mallow seed iij j:
Cinnamon ijss: Ginger x: Cloves, Nutmegs, A. v: Mace v: White Pepper,
Cardamums, A. ijss: let all be bruised and put into a Bag, with a Stone in it
to make it sink, then put it into the Wine aforesaid, where let all infuse a
quarter of a year, then draw it off, and bottle it up.

Here is to be noted, That some boil the Spices in the Wine, which they then
sweeten with white Sugar, and then let run through a Hyppocras bag, bottling it
up afterward: but if you would have this or any other Liquor to be very clear,
you must use the Tripple Hyppocras Bag (made of white Cotton or Flanel;) so
what faeces passes the first Bag will stay in the second, and what passes in
the second, will stay in the third and last; you must so order them, that the
point or corner of the one may hang in the Mouth of the other, and the point or
corner of the third and last, in the Mouth of the Cup or Vessel to receive the
Liquor.

41. To make excellent Hyppocras in an Instant.

of the best rectified S.V. lbj: Cinnamon ijss: Nutmegs, Mace, Ginger, A. v:
Cloves ijss: White Pepper j: mix, and digest ten or twelve days shaking the
Vessel twice a day in a cold place, in a Glass very close stopped, then press out
the Tincture very hard. To the Magma or faeces affuse fresh S. V. lbss: mix,
digest, and shake as aforesaid for ten or twelve days more, then press out the
Tincture very hard: Put this latter to the former: let them settle for four or
five days, then decant the clear, which keep and reserve for use. Of this
Liquor or Tincture you may take about a spoonfur or somewhat more, and mix with
a pint of your intended Wine, and it will become as good Hyppocras as any
whatsoever in a Moment.

Here is to be noted, both in this and in the former, That if the Wine be of it
self Harsh, it ought to be sweetened with Sugar (for thereby it is made far the
more grateful;) and then stand ^ill it is pure and fine before it is Bottled
up. Both these are very Cordial; they strengthen and fortify the Head, Heart
and Stomach, dry up Humidities, recreate the Spirits, and refresh the Body
over-wearied with too much labor. They cause Appetite, are good against
Fainting and Swooning sits, and mightily expel Wind, whether in the Stomach or
Bowels.

CHAP. XXV. Observations upon the Preparation of Chemical Mcdicaments.
I. Observations on Vegetables.
1. LET not the Vessels in which distillation is made be of Lead; for it
infects the Liquor with a Heterogene quality, changing its native Taste, and
sometimes making it Vomitive: nor yet of Copper, Brass, or Iron, lest the Liquor
Extracts part of the Metaline Tincture, or otherwise Corrodes it.

2. Let the Furnace, Or Distilling place be in a Chimney; that if any thing
should break, which contains a malign Fume or Vapor; it may go up the Chimney:
it would be good also, That it might be in a Yard, distant from the dwelling
House, lest any Rupture of Fire, through its extreme violence, should break
out, and so set the whole place in a flame.

3. Glasses by how much the higher they be, by so much the better they are: for
one Distillation is better than three Rectifications; let also the Cucurbit or
Glass Bodies, be in their Necks about three or four foot high.

4. It is necessary to have Rods with Iron rings at the ends of them, of all
sizes, to break Glasses off withal in any place: which is done by heating it
red hot, and putting it on the part to be broken, and holding it so long there,
till it be very hot, and breaks asunder; which may be yet helped, by dropping
some cold Water, on the place where you would have it to break.

5. Many Vessels ought to be Luted, especially those made of Glass: The Lute is
either for Coating or Closing the Junctures of Vessels, that they may not give
Vent, and alter the Nature of the Liquor, by letting the Spirits fly out,
especially when a strong fire is used. The Lute for Coating Retorts. Take
Potters Earth, Horse-dung, Sand, or Caput Mortuum of Vitriol, ana; mix and Work
them together with common Water. Lutum Sapientiae, for closing the Mouths and
Necks of Vessels. Calx Vive, (a little slaked with Milk) whites of Eggsreduced
to Water, make it into Past, which speedily apply, because it speedily drys.

6. Fill not the Vessels too full; for Liquors will boil over; and more solid
things will be one part burnt, before another is wrought on: of Gourds fill a
quarter part: of Retorts the one half: of Copper Vessels three parts; and in
Rectifying of Spirits, let the Vessel be half full.

7. Let those things which are Flatulent, as Wax, Rosir, Fat, and the like; and
such things as easily boil, as Honey, etc. be put in in a less quantity, and be
distilled in greater Vessels, with Salt, Sand, etc. Things of a more solid
Consistency, as Seeds, Woods, Roots, etc. may be distilled by Ashes or Sand,
which are to well fitted, for Stones or Coals may break your Glass.

8. A Balneum is proper to distill things not too strongly compacted: in which,
Herbs that are Hot, as Rosemary, Lavender, Sage, etc. are not to be distilled
with too gentle a heat, lest as much insipid Fregm as Spirit come forth: but
Herbs that are cold, as Lettice, Purslane, etc. are to be distilled with a very
moderate proportion, as of a Vapor, or Dew only, by which the Empyreuma, and
dissipation of Spirit are both avoided. Now to make a Balneum almost as hot as
Ashes: put Sand, or Sawdust into it, to make the heat intense.

9. If the Liquor has an Empyrenma, or Smatch of Burning, it may be helped by
putting it into a Glass, and setting it in a cold and moist place or else
exposing it to the heat of the Sun, and now and than opening the Glass, that
the fiery Atoms may exhale.

10. If you put Water into a seething Balneum, where Glasses are, let it be
hot, else it may endanger the breaking of the Glasses; and in taking of the
Glasses out, or from the fire, expose them not to the cold Air too suddenly,
lest they break.

11. By a Brass or Copper Vesica are distilled not only thin things, but things
also more gross, being first macerated in a proper Menstruum: so things dry by
Nature, or dried by Art, ought to be moistened and digested before hand with
common water, Cider, Perry, Wine, or Spirit of Wine; so great a quantity as is
sufficient for maceration, and then distilled in B M. or Brass Vesica Tin'd
within; adding to every pound of Herbs, six pounds of the Menstruum: and in the
same manner all Aromaticks, as Roots, Barks, Peels, Woods, Seeds, Leaves, or
Flowers are Distilled, so Oil and Water comes forth together, which are to be
separated.

12. By a Retort are distilled (not only the weighty Spirits of Minerals, but)
the the Spirits of Roots, Barks, Woods, Gums, Resins, Seeds, Fats, Oils, Wax,
Horns, etc. Where note, that both in this and all other Forms of Distillations,
acid and salt things exhale their Phlegm first, and their Spirit comes last: but
in things thin, hot and fermented, the spirit distills first, the phlegm
afterward.

13. To Digest in Horse-Dung, you must make a hole in the ground, and lay a
Course of Horse-Dung a foot thick, then a course of un-slacked Lime half a foot
thick; then another of Dung, then put in your Vessel, and lay round it Lime and
Horsedung mixed together: press it down very hard, sprinkle it every other day
with water, and when it ceases to be hot, take it out and put in more.

14. The Essences of Veritables; lie much in their Salts: and therefore to
every exaltation, it would be good to add either the Crystalls of its own
Ashes, or else of Tartar. This is evident, for a Lie made of the Ashes of any
Herb being frozen, will retain in the Ice, the very form and Idea of the Plant.

15. In distillation of cold moist Herbs, you need not so large Vessels, nor so
great a Fire, as for those whose substance is thick, and composed of hot parts.
The former must be distilled in B.M. the latter in Vessels of Copper Tin'd; of
which there are some called Refrigerants, which above the upper part that
receives the Vapors, contains a small quantity of cold water, to condense
those Vapors: others are called great Vessels, covered with a Moors-head (so
called from its form) with its beak and Serpentine, passing along a Vessel
filled with cold water. These Serpentines are much before Refrigerants.

16. The common people (in distillation of Rose Water and other Waters) make
use of Leaden or Pewter-Heads, but the Vapors arising from the matter
distilled, do gnaw and fret off some particles of the Metal, which very much
changes the qualities of the water distilled, into the nature of Lead, thereby
making these Waters oftentimes hurtful.

17. So also waters distiled in Copper Vessels, not Tin'd, corrode off and
dissolve certain Particles of the Copper, which is known from the tart taste,
and greenish residence at bottom.

18. Hence it appears, That those Metals are very unfit to be used in the Art
of distillation; and since that Tin is the only Metal, that is able to resist
the corrosion of Vapors arising from Vegitables; and that it will neither be
corroded nor dissolved; it is requisite that great care be taken, that the
insides of Copper Vessels be well Tin'd at least, or instead thereof, that
their heads be made of absolute Lattin.

19. But in the distillation of Nightshade, Housleek, Plantane, Poppies,
Henbane, white Roses, Lettice, Purslane, and other cold Herbs designed for
Collyriums, and other outward uses; a leaden or Pewter Head may serve very
well, because it rather adds virtue to those Waters, than diminishes it.

20. But the best method to distill Herbs that abound in moisture, is to distill
their juice; which if it be done in a moderate sand-heat, the water will ascend
with some volatile Salt particles, by which it is made the more efficacious,
and this efficacy will be increased, if you add also the fixed Salt of the
Faeces. Or rather to every quart of Water a dram of pure Niter, for this keeps
the water for many years, and is more fit than its own Salt.

21. Herbs having an acid Juice, as Sorrel, Wood Sorrel, Barberry leaves, etc.
yield their essential Salt, by taking their said Juice, purisying of it,
evaparating part of its humidity, and crystalizing of it, after the usual way.

22. After the same manner you may have the essential Salt of other juycy
Herbs, which are bitter, and without Scent, as Fumitory, Hops, Endive, Succory,
Dandelion, Carduus, common Thistle, etc.

23. These Salts are generally soul and cloudy, and therefore may be purified,
which is done by dissolving them in a Lixivium made of the fixed Salt of the
same Herb; then filtring the dissolution, evaporating and crystalizing, as
aforesaid.

24. Waters are drawn off of the matter without digestion: Oils are drawn off
of the matter being digested and putrefied: Spirits are drawn off from the
matter being fermented. Hence it appears.

25. That Spirits are Oils dilated: Oils, Spirits concentrated, the one raised
from putrefaction; the other from fermentation: and that both Oils and Spirits
are a portion of Volatile Salt sublimed and expanded, or dilated in its own
humidity.

26. But such things as by their Fragrancy and Odor show a previous natural
Fermentation, need no artificial Ferment, for they yield their spirit without
it: and an artificial or forced Fermentation, would cause a dissipation of the
chiefest part of their sulphury and volatile parts which are sought for.

27. In this case, If you bruise the matter to be distilled (taken when the
Herb is full of Vigor, and between flower and seed) and add thereto three times
its weight of fair water, or (which is better) of its own distilled water; you
need but digest 2, 4 or 5 days (not ferment) in a gentle heat, and in a blind
head: then, at the end of the time, to distill with a Moors head and a
serpentine, so long, till the water distilling has neither Taste nor Smell: you
will have a volatile spirituous liquor, which being impregnated with the fixed
Salt of the Faeces, you may rectify in B. M. wherein the spirituous Liquor, and
volatile Salt will first ascend with the oily part, which two Liquors separate
according to Art, casting away the watery and unprofitable part, remaining in
the Vessel after Rectification.

28. But before you cast away the aforesaid remaining watery part, you may, if
you so please, separate from it the former fixed Salt, you added. And after
this manner are distilled all hot, bitter, and odoriferous Plants, as,
Wormwood, Horehound, Sothernwood, Savory, Baum Hyssop, Time, Mint, Pennyroyal,
Cammomil, Sweet-Marjoram Rosemary, Sage, Lavender; etc.

29. Experience has also Confirmed, That if the aforesaid distilled Liquor (at
Sect. 27.) before rectification, be often Cohobated upon the Feces, ( viz. 6,
8, or 10 times) the volatile Salt will arise the more largely; and in the
Process, almost all the fixed parts of the Matter will ascend and become
Volatile, which is a Note worthy of Observation.

30. And, in this Case, if you make the Trial, the fixed Salt remaining in the
foeces, after ten Cohobations, will not be the tenth part of the said Salt,
lodged in the same, before the first Cohobation. Hence it appears.

31. That THAT which we call the fixed Salt, is no such thing by Nature, but
wholly Volatile, and is rendered otherwise only by Incineration, or the fire.
How easy then may it be to render this Fixed Salt Volatile again, or to restore
it to that State, to which it naturally aspires? It is certainly done by
loosening it from the Chains of the fire.

32. Scurvy grass, Horse radish, Brooklime, Watercresses, Garden Cresses,
Rocket, etc. may have a different way of Distillation from the former: for as
they abound with more volatile Spirits, and more volatile Salts: so they admit
yet less of fermentation, and therefore ought to have a proper menstruum
(stronger than common water) which may attract dissolve, and join with the
Essential parts of those Plants, and carry those parts along with it in
Distillation, without changing their natures and Virtues.

33. To this purpose we recommend to you March Beer, strong clear and well made
Rhenish-Wine, Cider, Perry or Mead: as also spirit of Wine, as proper
Menstruums. Take a Quantity (as much as you please) of the Herb you design,
when it is in flower: shred it small, put it into a Copper Vesica tin'd, upon
which pour as much Mead, Rhenish Wine, etc. as well cover the Herbs three or
four Inches over: place it in a proper Furnace covered with its Moor's head and
serpentine adjoined: digest without fire for about 24 hours: then distill (but
not too hastily) that the spirituous and volatile parts of the Herb may ascend:
continue the Distillation till the Drops that fall are almost iusipid.

34. But that you may have a more replenished Spirit, empty the Vesica from the
Faeces: put into it the same quantity of bruised herbs again, upon which pour
all the aforesaid distilled water, and its equal quantity of wine, which digest
and distill, as aforesaid, The distillation being over, put in again fresh
herbs, pouring upon them the last distilled liquor, which digest, and distill,
as aforesaid, repeating the distillation till you have a Spirit strong enough.
This done, rectify in B.M. or in a sand heat, keeping the spirit repleat with
the Volatile Salt, which ascends first, apart by it self in a glass Bottle
close stopd: and in another glass put the spirituous water, which follows the
former, continuing the distillation till the drops are almost insipid.

35. After all the primary distillations (before you come to rectification)
there are great Sediments, the thinner part of which you may separate from the
faeces by Expression: after which being clarified, you may by abstraction of
the superfluous humidity, reduce it to the form of an Extract, with which you
may mix the fixed Salt of its faeces aforesaid: thus have you all the parts of
the Plant, wherein any imaginable Virtue does reside. This Extract is of the
Nature of the Herb, and may be given either alone in a Bolus, or else dissolved
in some proper liquor a ss ad ij or iij.

36. The distillation of Flowers is best done, being beforehand pickled with
Salt. Suppose Roses. Take of the Flowers lb 50. bruise them in a stone Mortar
with a wooden Pestle, and strew them, by degrees with Bay Salt finely poudr'd
lb jv: put the whole into a large Pitcher or two of Potters earth, or earthen
Jars with narrow Mouths: crowd the Flowers hard in, and stop the Mouth of the
Vessel so firmly with Cork and melted Wax, that no Air may penetrate it. Set
the Vessel so stopped in a Cellar for 6, 8, 10 or 12 Weeks: so will the flowers
when open have a kind of acid and winelike scent, Which is a sign of their
Fermentation. Take of these Flowers lb j or ij: and in a glass Cucurbit, in
B.M. distill to dryness: Take the Faeces out of the Cucurbit, and put into it
again lb vj or vij of the pickled flowers, and the first distilled water, and
distill in a sand heat, with a gentle fire (as before) till the humidity is
almost all come over. Then put in new flowers, pouring upon them the last
distilled water, and distill again, as aforesad; repeating this work so long as
you have any flowers remaining. This done.

37. To make a rectification. Put a small part of the former water into a
Bolthead, and in B. M. with a gentle fire, draw off about the twelfth part,
which keep by it self: put in more of the former water, and do again as we have
just now directed, repeating the same work, till all the first water at Sect.
36. is rectified. Put all these twelfth parts together, which keep in a bottle
with glass stopple. All the remaining waters also put together, and continue
rectifications at several Repetitions, till you have all that is spirituous.
The spirituous Liquor keep in the Bottle with a glass stopple, rectify anew, in
an evaporating Bath in a Bolt head, having a long neck, perfectly luted; so
have you an Ethereal inflamable spirit; laden with Volatile Salt: which if it
be of Roses, you may call it Spiritus Rosarum, or, Spirit of Roses. The Remains
of this Rectification put to the former water, so have you an excellent
Rose Water much better than you can draw by any ordinary means, which keep in
Glass bottles close stopped.

38. If you keep these Bottles in a Cellar a while, new oil will ascend by
degrees to the top of the water: and swim above it in little flakes, almost
like Snow, which you may separate according to Art. This is Adeps Rosarum, Fat
of Roses.

39. Now, if you desire the Adeps rather than the Spirit, you will sooner have
your desire, by redistilling several times the aforesaid Rose Water upon
new-Roses, for fresh and new Roses yield more Oil by far, than those that are
pickled or sermented.

40. But there are some, who only macerate Roses in Wine, ana, for some days;
then distill; which is indeed a much shoter way; but far inferior to the former,
because you have a mixture of S. V. with your Water or spirit of Roses.

41. From the remains of all the Distillations, you may make a purging Extract
of Roses (by Sect. 35.) and from the saeces calcined, you may Extract a Salt,
by elixivation, which may be mingled with the Extract. Dose a ss: ij: or iij.

42. Some persons distill Rose Water by descent, by putting the Roses about an
Intch thick, upon a fine Linen cloth, tied upon the top of a large glass
Vessel, or of glazed Earth, and applying over it, the bottom of a flat dish of
white Lattin, or some other such like Vessel, fitted to the compass of the
Roses or mouth of the Receiver, having the inside of its hollowness covered
with Ashes, about half an Intch thick, over which is put soft burning Coals. By
this means the water distills into the Vessel underneath. This is not so good
at that we have formerly taught, yet not to be despised.

43. Lavender Flowers are too dry to be distilled as Roses. In this case, you
may put upon them Lavender Water distilled from the Herb, and distill in a
Copper Vesica, well Tinned, fixed with its Moors Head and Serpentine, being
first macerated in a very gentle heat for three or four days space. Repeat the
Distillation by many affusions of the distiled water, upon fresh flowers, (as
at Sect 39.) so have you Oil and Water, which separate. Thus may you distill
Rosemary-Flowers, and all other hot Flowers, which are naturally dry of
substance.

44. But if instead of the Water of the same plant, you take the Spirit of
May-Dew (see our Pharmacopaea Londinensis, Lib. 3. Cap. 14. Sect. 32.) and Aqua
de Stercore bovis (in Lib. 2. Cap. 1. Sect 7. of this present work) of each
equal parts, putting them upon the Flowers, and then Distill in Balneo Vaporoso,
by a large glass Cucurbit, you will yet have a more excellent and odoriferous
Water, repleat with Volatillity and Spirits, in much greater abundance.

45. But to draw inflamable Spirits and odoriferous, from all sorts of Flowers,
will be a thing very difficult, unless you conjoyn with them some other parts
of the Plant, as Seeds, Fruit, Peels, Rinds or Roots, etc. To the Canker Rose,
add their Hips bruised; and to the Garden Roses theirs. To the sweet Eglantine
or Sweet-Bryar its leaves: To the Flowers of Rosemary, Sage, Marjoram, Mint,
Betony, Bawm, Lavender, Time, Gill flowers, Violets, Jessamine, etc. their
seeds well bruised. To Flowers of Peony, Angelica, Parsley, Dill, Fennel,
Flower-de-luces, Lillys, etc. their seeds and roots bruised. To the Flowers of
Oranges, Limons, Citrons, etc. their Fruits well stamped, the Rind or Peel
chiefly. To the Flowers of Elder, Dwarf-Elder, Petty Mugget, their Berries well
bruised, etc.

46. But in this last case, there is a special necessity of Fermentation, for
that is the Soul of Vegetable Spirits, as putrefaction is the Soul of their
Oils: If when the Flowers are mingled with their Seeds, there be not humidity
enough to facilitate the Fermentation, you must to your bruised Flowers, Seeds,
etc. put a little Wine, or some other Liquor, and then add Leven or Yest, to
raise the sermentation: Or dissolve your Leaven or Yest in the humidity you
add, mix it with your flowers, Seeds, etc. then put them into a double Glazed
earthen Pitcher, pressing them hard down, which stop close with a Cork, and Wax
melted over it; so keep it till it is somewhat sowrish, or has got a Wine-like
Scent; then distill the matter in a Glass-Cucurbit in B.M. so have you an ardent
inflamable Spirit, strongly repleat with the Odor of the Flowers, which you
may distill upon new Flowers, and rectify, as we have formerly taught.

47. But because it is not always possible to have those other parts, when the
flowers are in their prime; you may choose some foreign matter for a foundation
of their Fermentation; as Sugar, Honey, or Manna, to every lb or xij of
Flowers, ij of Sugar, Honey or Manna, etc. to which put some other liquor, if
their dryness require it, and a little Leaven, as aforesaid. By this method you
may distill all Aromaticks and Odoriferous Plants, and so obtain their
Odoriferous and inflamable Spirits.

48. We have taught the Distillation of Carminative Seeds, in our Pharmacop.
Lib. 4. Cap. 3. Sect. 4. by which way you will have Spirit, Oil and Water,
which you must separate. The Distillation you may many times repeat upon new
bruised Seeds, by pouring continually the last distilled water upon them and
then proceeding in all things, as in the first Distillation; so will you have
much Oil and a spirituous water, repleat with the Volatile Salt of the same
Seed. This continual Cohobation of the same water upon new Seed, gives you a
much larger quantity of Oil, than otherwise you would have. And here note, that
a maceration of the Seeds three or four days, before Distillation, will cause a
larger quantity of Oil to ascend, than a maceration of twenty four hours, as is
usual.

49. But if you desire the Oil chiefly; the seeds being bruised, and put into
their proportion of Water, put them into a glass Cucurbit, which cover with a
strong Head well luted, putting them into Horsedung, (so deep as the matter is
high in the Glass) where let them putrify for about 3 weeks, so will you have a
larger quantity of Oil than the other ways. Some mix Salt of Tartar with the
bruised feeds, hoping thereby to get the more Oil, but they that consider how
easily fixed Salts conjoyn themselves with Oil, may otherwise be convinced of
that fallacy, than by being beholden to Soap-Boylers for a Demonstration.

50. The Volatile Salt of Vegetables is so subtle, and so intermixed with other
substances, that it is a difficult thing either to separate or to discern it,
unless it be very plentiful, and than it will show it self by its smell. In
cold herbs it is imperceptible, and inseparable from its adjoined matter. But
from hot biting Herbs, as Cresses, Scurvy Grass, Mustard, Charlock, etc. it is
evidently apparent.

51. These kinds of seeds have various ways of Distillation: 1. By bruising of
them, adding hot water or Rhenish Wine, stopping them up in an earthen Vessel,
and digesting three or four days in a gentle heat to cause fermentation (which
is here caused without Leven) and then distilling (by Sect. 46. and 48.
aforegoing;) by which the Spirits, Oils and Volatile Salt come forth mixed
together.

52. Or, you may to the bruised Seeds, put S. V. rectified, and in a glass
Cucurbit, distill by B. M. or in Sand with a moderate sire, so will you have an
Oil and a Spirit, well filled with the Volatile Salt of the seed.

53. Or you may put the Seeds whole and without addition into a glass or
earthen Retort, filling about 2/3 of it it; then placing it in a Reverberatory
furnace, and luting it to a Receiver, make a gradual fire, very small at the
beginning, which augment by degrees for 10 or 12 hours) to extremity of heat,
so will you have in the Receiver Phlegm, Spirit, Oil and Volatile Salt, all mixed
together, which afterward rectify in B.M. or sand in a gentle heat, in a Bolt
Head, having a long neck, etc. By this rectification the Volatile Salt will
afcend, and coagulate like a white Crystaline matter, which you may preserve by
it self, by unluting the Head and putting another in its place: but you must
speedily and with great care put the Salt into a glass bottle, having a glass
stopple, that it may not exhale nor dissolve into Liquor.

54. Proceed in rectification, so the Spirit and Oil will ascend together,
which last will swim upon the Spirit; and the watery part and balsamic or
grossest part of the Oil will remain at bot^^ tom; which by reason of its ill
smell, may be for outward uses, in all cold affects.

55. Berries having an aqueous Juice, as Elder, Dwarf-Eider, etc. ought to be
juyced, which juice is to be put into an Oaken Barrel, and set in a Cellar to
ferment, till it becomes Wine, somewhat intermixed with acid. Then tap the
Vessel a little above the Fae^es, and put the clear Liquor into a Copper
Vesica, tin'd within; to which affixing its Moors Head, Serpentine and
Recipient, distill with a moderate fire, till about 2/3 of the Liquor is come
over, so will you have a burning and inflamable Spirit. What remains in the
Vesica, you may separate from its sediment, and the clear part, reduce to the
form of an Extract, adding the Salt of the first Faeces.

56. In the Distillation of Juniper Berries, and such other like, which have a
melliginous juice, consider whether you design to have the ardent or burning
Spirit, or the Volatile Oil. If the former, by reason they want native
moisture, you must to the bruised Berries add Rain Water or Wine, with some
Leaven or Yest, and Honey, Sugar or Manna, to hasten a fermentation, (as we
have taught at Sect. 46, and 47, aforegoing) then distill, so will you have a
burning or inflamable Spirit, with some Oil.

57. Or, to the bruised Berries, you may put rectified S. V. (as we have taught
at Sect. 52.) digest three or four days, in a very gentle Sand-heat, then
distill with a moderate sire, so will you have an inflamable Spirit, repleat
with the best and the most volatile part of the Berries.

58. If you design to draw Oil, first bruise the Berries well, and put to every
lbiij of Berries, water (almost boiling hot) lbij: put them up into an earthen
Pitcher, which stop close with Cork and Wax: putrisy for ten, twelve or
fourteen days, in a gentle Sand heat; then distill in a Copper Vesica (tinned
within) with its proper Moors Head, Serpentine and Recipient, so shall you have
a water Repleat with Volatile Salt, Spirit and Volatile Oil, white and
odoriferous, which Oil will swim at top, and must be separated according to
Art. The water you may rectify in B. M. or a Sand heat, in a Bolt-Head, casting
away the aqueous part remaining at bottom, after distillation unless you design
a Cohobation upon new Berries, by which means, you will have more Oil, and the
water will be the more spirituous, and repleat with a Volatile Salt.

59. From the Berries and Water remaining at every distillation, you may make a
melliginous Extract, having a kind of substance like Honey, containing the
Balsamic and fixed Salt of the Berries, thus: The Vessels being cool, strain
and press out what you can from the skins and seeds, which clarify and in a
glazed earthen Pot, Evaporate the superfluous humidity, over a very gentle
fire, till that which remains be as thick as an Extract; to which add the Salt
of the expressed Faeces made by Calcination, Elixiviation, Evaporation, etc:
This Extract Helmont cries up for an excellent Purge; For it gently carries off
bad humors, strengthens the Stomach and Bowels, expells Gravel, Wind and
Poisons, eases pain, provokes Urine, and cleanses all the urinal passages. Dose
a ij: ad ss. With this you may make up several Electuaries and Treacles, but
when in those cases you use it, you ought to make it of the thickness of new
Honey, by adding a sufficient quantity of its own inflamable Spirit, with a
small portion of its Oil.

60. In the distillation of Wheat, Rye, Barley and Oats, if you design a burning
and inflamable Spirit; the Grain ought to receive a previous fermentation, by
being converted into Malt, and then by the Art of the Brewer, by the affusion
of a large quantity of boiling water, digestion and proper fermentation with
Yest, to be converted into Beer or Ale: This Beer or Ale, if distilled (in all
respects) as you distill Wine, to get the Spirit of Wine (to wit, in a Copper
Vesica, with its Moors head, Serpentine and Receiver) yields an inslamable
Spirit, vastly repleat with the Sulphur, or volatile Oil and Salt of the Grain,
altogether as strong, subtle and penetrating, as is that of Wine, and perhaps
if drawn with care, and in double Vessels, full as pleasant and virtuous.

61. Or if you take Meal of Wheat, Rye, etc. and make it into Bread with a good
quantity of Leaven: if to this Bread you assuse Rain Water, and cause it again
gently to ferment, then destil in a copper Vesica, etc. Or otherwise in a glass
Cucurbit in B.M. you shall have a water repleat with a good quantity of
inflamable Spirit, Oil and Volatile Salt; all which by Rectification you may
separate, as we have before taught.

62. And now whilst I think of it, let me tell you, that it is the nature of
fixed Alcalies to destroy the power of Acids, they being opposite one to another
in nature; for Salt of Tartar, being put into stale Beer, makes it work afresh,
and become New (as it were) again; it also purifies and preserves water from
all filth, keeps it sweet from stinking, and if put in, in a due proportion,
makes it drink not much unlike Milk: but if you put in too much, it will make
it taste so much like Piss, that it will not be potable. Now in putting in of
Salt of Tartar into a barrel of stale or hard Beer, whereby it is provoked to a
new Fermentation; although it may make it taste like new drink at present; yet
if it be kept long, it will unavoidably become Acid again, then flat, insipid
and dead, by reason that a large quantity of Spirits are certainly wasted by
such a new working.

63. From Wheat, Rye, etc. you may distill a Phlegm, Spirit, Oil and Volatile
Salt, thus: fill about 2/3 of a glass Retort, well luted, with the Grain you
desire to distill, which place in a close Reverberating Furnace, and distill
with a gradual fire, according to Ait; so shall you have a good quantity of
Phlegm mixed with the Spirit, Oil and Volatile Salt; which you may rectify in a
Bolt-head, with a long neck in a sand heat: by repeating rectifications, you
will have a volatile, white, crystaline Salt, or a very penetrating Spirit,
containing the said Salt, which will be dissolved therein; and also a volatile
Oil very penetrating, united to some few Particles of the volatile Salt.

64. The ardent Spirit of these kinds of Grain, at Sect. 60. is of the same
nature, properties, qualities and virtues with Spirit of Wine, and may serve to
the same uses. The other volatile Spirits and Salts are Sudorifick,
attennuating and expelling hurtful humors through the Pores, either by Sweat,
or insensible transpiration: They are powerful against Poison, Plague, and
other Epidemick Distempers, and very effectual against Asthma's, Pleurisies,
and other Diseases of the Breast and Lungs. They help respiration, and dissove
coagulated Blood, provided it be given before it be turned into corruption.
Dose a gr. x. ad ss. in Broth, Wine, or other Vehicle. The Oil is most commonly
used externally in cold pains, Gout, Rheumatisms, Palsies, Numbness, etc.

65. From Pease, Tares, and Beans (in a Reverberatory Furnace) there is to be
got a great quantity of volatile Salt, and in much larger proportion, and with
more ease than from any other grain whatsoever, which without doubt is most of
it the very body of the fixed Salt, (made fixed by incineration) which is found
in a large measure in these kinds of substances.

66. Take Beans lbiiij or v, whole and dry, put them into an earthen Retort, or
a glass one well luted, so large as that about 2/3 may remain empty: put it
into a close Furnace of Reverberation; lute to it a large Recipient, stop the
Registers of the cover of the Furnace, and then kindle in the Cinderplace, a
small fire, only to warm the Retort, and matter within in, which keep so for an
hour, then begin to kindle a fire in the Hearth-place, which let be very small,
for an hour longer, after which increase the fire gradatim, from hour to hour,
but not to excess: in the mean season you may see descend into the Receiver,
the Aquaeous part of the Beans, in large quantity. After this give a little Air
to the Register of the cover of the Furnace on the Receivers side, continually
augmenting the fire, till you see the great Ball to be filled with white
clouds, which will condense by degrees into Liquor, the oleaginous and salt
parts, sinking to the bottom of the Vessel, keep now an equal fire, for about
two hours, giving a little air to the Register, after which open it for
altogether, giving a more violent heat, and at length a flaming fire, which
continue till the vapors cease, and the Receiver is clear. Let then the fire go
out, and the Vessels cool. In the Receiver you have much Phlegm mixed with Oil
and Spirit, and volatile Salt, so penetrating, that you will not be able to
hold your Nose and Eyes over the Mouths of the Vessels.

67. Put all these matters speedily into a Bolt-head, with a long neck, covered
with its Head well luted, and fitted with a beak and Receiver, place it in a
Sand heat (but in a cool airy place) so may you see the Volatile Salt ascend by
little and little, and coagulate it self in the Head, (which you must often
cool by double cloths, dipped in cold water, to hinder the dissolution of the
Salt,) this Salt with what speed may be take out of the Head, and keep it in a
glass Bottle well stopped, and in a cool place, for it turns into Liquor with the
least heat, and sooner than any other Volatile Salt; but you must have another
Head ready to put on in the place of the former, whose junctures being well
luted, continue the Rectification, so will you have in the Reciplent, the rest
of the Volatile Salt dissolved in a little of the Phlegm, with the Volatile Oil,
which you may separate, and keep apart: the useless Phlegm, and stinking part of
the Oil remaining at bottom of the Mattress.

68. This Volatile Salt of Beans is a strong Sudorifick, and one of the most
subtle and volatile Salts that is; being of the same use with all other
Volatile Salts: it is good against Palsies, Cramps, withred Limbs, Epilepsies,
Apoplexies, Gouts, Rheumatisms, Cholicks, and other Diseases of the Head,
Brain, Womb, Nerves and Joints: it kills Worms, and is admirably good in sits
of the Mother; the Oil is also of the same Virtue, You may mix it with Oil of
bitter Almonds, or Oil of Ben, and anoint with it the Stomach, Navel and Belly.
In Diseases of the Brain and Womb, put it up the Nostrils. You may give
inwardly in a preper Vehicle a gr. jv ad gr. xij.

69. Thus may be drawn the Salts, Spirits, and Oils of Kidney Beans, French
Beans, Pease, Vetches, Lentils, and other sorts of Pulse. Where Note, that
after this Distillation the fixed Salt of the Faeces is scarcely one eighth part
of what it would be in an open Calcination, by which its natural Volatility
appears. The same thing (but in far different proportion) you will meet with in
Woods. The Salt of Guajacum, drawn from the Faeces remaining in the Retort,
will not be the twentieth part of what may be found in the same wood, by an
open Calcination.

70. In the Distillation of Lignum Rhodium you must follow the Method in
distilling of Dill-seed, as we have taught in Our Pharmacopoeia lib. 4. cap. 3.
sect. 4. only with this disserence, That the rasped Substance, or Powder of the
Wood being macerated 2 or 3 Weeks before Distillation. The Water may be much of
the same use with Rose Water, not being very different in scent; the same
observe in all other Aromatic Woods.

71. In Our Dispensatory, we have taught the way to distill Spirit and Oil of
Soot; Wherein you have this to Note, That the Volatile Salt comes with the
Phlegm, Spirit, and Oil, which are to be rectified in a Bolt-head with a
Sand-heat, and a Head and Receiver well Luted. A gentle fire makes the Volatile
Salt to ascend first, white and Crystaline into the Head, which remove; and
perfect the Rectification by Sect. 67, aforegoing. The Volatile Spirit, Oil,
and Salt are strangely Sudorifick, and operate much like to the Volatility of
Animals. The Salt is given a gr. v. ad j: the Oil a gut. ij ad jv. or vj: The
Spirit a ss ad j: it pertakes much of the Virtues of the Volatile Salt, a great
part whereof it conrains.

72. Gourds, Cucumers, Melons, and the little cold Fruits, contain little
Spirit or Volatile Salt, and therefore yield only an insipid Phlegm, or very
little more, for which cause Sake, you may distill their Pulp, as you distill
Lettice, Purslane, and other cold Herbs.

73. But Musk-melons by their scent demonstrate something more of Volatility,
for which reason you may cause them a little to ferment; then distill in B.M. or
a Sandheat very moderate: so will the odoriferous, volatile, and ardent Spirit
first ascend, then the Phlegm or Water, which keep apart. They are said both to
cool, cause rest, and are good in intermitting Agues and Fevers, being
inwardly given: outwardly they Smooth and Beautify the Skin.

74. The Oil of Guajacum distilled by the addition of Water, as you distill the
Oil of Lignum Rhodium, is said to be an admirable thing in Diseases of the
Bladder, and to purify the Mass of Blood. And some affirm, That by continuing
the use of it for some Weeks, a gut. jv ad xij. in its own Water from iij to
jv, vij, or viij; it will drive out, and carry away through the Pores of the
Skin, the whole Venereal Venom, without any use of Mercury, especially if it be
not too inveterate. It also cures Venereal Ulcers in the Mouth. The Oil which
is distilled by a Retort, by reason of its ill scent, is never given inwardly.

75. Citrons are distilled (being first cut or bruised) in a Glass Cucurbit,
filling it half full. Lute to it the Receiver, digest a day and Night, then
distill in B.M. or in Sand with a moderate fire. The juice is seldom distilled
alone, but only purified, for the dissolution of Pearls, Coral, and such like.
But the aqueous part, you may separate in B.M. so will the Remaining juice be
more acid than ordinary.

76. From the outward yellow rinds of Citrons you may distill an Oil, thus: Put
the said Rinds into a Glass Cucurbit, upon which put Rain Water to overtop them
three or four fingers, cover and lute it well: digest ten days in a moderate
heat, then distill in Sand by a gentle fire, so have you a fragrant Water with a
little, yellow, odoriferous Oil, of a very sharp and penetrating Taste. You may
give a gut.ij ad viij. mixed with fine poudered Sugar, and then dissolved in iv
or vj. of its Water. It is good against all malign, pestilential and epidemick
Diseases, expelling the poisonous Miasms by insensible transpiration. It is
good against all cold Diseases of the Stomach, comforts the Heart, and helps
the Palpitation thereof, curing also most cold and moist Diseases of the Head
and Brain; and is very effectual against the Biting of Vipers, and all sorts of
Serpents. With Oil of Nut^ megs by Expression, you may make of it an excellent
Balsam to the same Intentions.

77. Cherries Red and Black, Bramble-berries, Raspberries, Mulberries, and
Straw berries, admit of the common way of Distillation. If you desire only a
Water, bruise them, and distill in a Glass Cucurbit in B. M. so have you a Water
of a pleasing Taste and Scent. But if you would have a Burning and Inflamable
Spirit, you must ferment them (without any addition) whether you use the juice
or the bruised Fruits. You may know when the fermentation is at height, by the
Winy Scent, which will be in about four days time, being digested in a gentle
heat in Sand; and which you may perceive when you unlute the Vessel: being
fermented, put the matter into a Glass Cucurbit, cover it with its Head, Lute
it, and distill in B.M. or Sand with a gentle fire; so will you have ascend,
first a Volatile, Inflamable, Odoriferous Spirit, which keep by it self in a
Glass Bottle, with a Glass Stopple; continue the Distillation, and you have a
Water also.

78. Water of Green Wallnuts is distilled after the general Method, but you
will do well, if you make many Cohobations of the Water distilled upon green
Wallnuts every time, and at last add thereto the Salt of the faeces; or rather
to every quart thereof, a dram of the most pure Niter, which may keep it
better than its own Salt: by this means, it will not only keep longer, but be
of much greater Virtues.

79. In the Distillation of Wine, principally French and Rhenish Wines, there
is not above a sixth part Spirit; the rest is a kind of Phlegm with an Acid. For
this Phlegm being evaporated away to the thickness of Honey, and then distilled
in a Retort in a close Reverberatory Furnace, you will have an Acid Spirit,
which lay in the Wine before Distillation, mixed with a good quantity of Phlegm
and a dark colored Stinking Oil, of no great use: At last remains a faeces,
which may be calcined, and a Salt drawn from it by the common way of
Elixiviation.

80. This Spirit of Wine (commonly called Brandy) being so much separated from
its Phlegm, as that being fired, it will either Burn all away, or fire
Gun-pouder, is called rectified Spirit of Wine, being a Body incorruptible, and
able to preserve what it keeps within it self from Putrefaction. It is
excellent against Gangreens, removes all Corruption from the parts, opens the
Passages, quickens the Circulation of the Blood, agitates the Spirits, removes
Rheumatisms, and is an admirable experiment against Burnings.

81. However this Spirit (though very pure) contains some small matter of
Phlegm, which may be lessened very much by rectifying it upon a fifth or sixth
part of its weight, of well dried and pure Salt of Tartar. This rectification
you may repeat, upon the Salt, (drying it every time) till you have a Spirit of
Wine wonderful strong, and of a good Scent, which work you may repeat four,
five, six or seven times as you see convenient. Lastly, putting it into a
Bolt-head, you may in a Lukewarm B. M. rectify it again: so have you a most
pure Spirit, which some call Tartariz'd Spirit of Wine. Ten or twelve Drops of
this taken inwardly, will operate more than a spoonful of the former.

82. But the former (though a most pure Spirit) can in no wise be called
Tartarized Spirit of Wine, for as much as it has carried along with it no part
of the Salt of Tartar. And because we desire not to leave you in the Dark, we
shall here give you the rational Process. Take pure fine Salt of Tartar, put it
into a Glass Cucurbit, large and high, pour new Rhenish Wine upon it, by little
and little; so will an Ebulition or fermentation follow (raised from the acid
of the Wine, and Alcaly of the Tartar:) continue pouring on Wine by degrees,
till the Ebulition ceases, and then cease the putting on of more Wine. Let the
Cucurbit be of that bigness, that it may not be above full: put it in a Sand
Furnace, exactly lute the Junctures of the Head and Recipient, and draw off a
Spirit with a strong Charcole fire, that the Salt of Tartar which is heavy, and
slow to ascend may arise with the Spirit of Wine: continue the Distillation
with the same fire, till you perceive the Phlegm begins to ascend; then cease,
so have you Spirit of Wine, repleat with Volatile Salt of Tartar.

83. This done, evaporate the remaining Phlegm; dry and calcine the Sediment,
and upon every ounce of Salt of Tartar, pour a quart of well purged, Green,
Austere, and new fermented Wine, then Lute and distill, as before. Reserve the
Spirit by its self; and from the faeces evaporate the Phlegm, dry and calcine,
etc. pouring on more Wine, and renewing all the aforegoing Operations, till all
or most of your Salt of Tartar is ascended with the Spirit of Wine. For by this
Work often repeated, the utmost grain of the fixed Salt of Tartar may be rendered
Volatile. This Spirit of Wine tartarized, you may rectify as aforesaid, to what
degree of Purity you please.

84. Now whereas Wine is nothing else but the Must or Juice of Ripe Grapes,
whose Spirituous parts are set at Liberty by fermentation; it is more or less
gross, according as its fermentation is less or more, by which it more or elss
abounds with Tartar, and less or more with Spirits. And therefore French Wines
being better fermented yields more Spirits, than Spanish or Canary Wines, which
are a kind of but half fermented Wine. For Spanish Wine does not endure a
fermentation so strong as other Wines, and that is the reason it is both
sweeter and more glutinous than other Wines more fermented. Must, or juice of
Grapes is answerable to Wort made of Malt, before it is wrought up with Yest:
if therefore you distill either Must or Wort, you will have a great deal of
insipid Fiegm or Water; after that a foetid Oil; then a few weak acid Spirits,
being some of the Essential Salt dissolved; and at bottom an Earthy Mass, out
of which by Calcination and Elixiviation, may be drawn an alcalious Salt: but
out of the whole you shall not get one drop of Burning or Inflamable Spirit.
Now, if you let this Must or Wort but ferment, they turn into Wine or Ale: this
fermentation is made by its Essential Salt, which being Volatile delivers it
self from the aforesaid Oily parts, and divides, peirces, or breaks them to
pieces, and by its subtilty rarifies them into Spirit, whereby the said Liquors
become Wine or Ale: and according as this fermentation is more or less, so are
they more or less spirituous, and less or more sweet and glutinous; and in
Distillation yield more or less Burning and Inflamable Spirit: for the Spirit
of Wine or Ale, is nothing but the Oil divided, rarefied, and exalted by the
Essential Salt. And since that in Spanish Wines, part of the Phlegm is
evaporated before fermentation, whereby the Essential Salt has not liberty to
expand it self, and rarify the Oil, as it otherwise would do, it comes to pass,
that there is but an imperfect, and as it were half fermentation: for the Oil
being but half subtiliz'd, has still strength enough to hinder the Tartness of
the Salt, and to keep the old Sweet Taste of the Liquor. And this is the true
reason, That although Spanish Wine is much stronger than any French Wines, it
yields much less Spirit than they, because the Spirit of Wine does consist in a
rarefied Oil repleat with Essential and Volatile Salt.

85. The Crystals of Tartar, will only dissolve in hot Water, always
Coagulating as the Water grows cold. These Crystals are the Essential Salt
constituted of an acid and an Alcaly or Volatile Salt: and they are so mingled,
that they are strongly united, and not to be separated without Art; or made so
as to be dissolved in cold Water. But if you dissolve these Crystals in hot
Water, and assuse thereupon Salt of Tartar made by Calcination, you may so
dissolve the Union of the Salts, by mastering of the Acid, with the Alcaly,
that they shall not resume their former nature, but become together all of them
dissoluble in cold Water.

86. In making of Tartar Chalybeat, some instead of the filings of Steel do to
every pound of the Crystals of Tartar dissolved in boiling Water, cast in an
Ounce of Vitriol of Mars; or filings Steel prepared with Spirit of Vitriol, and
after a little time, straining of it, set it to Crystalize.

87. Alcalious Salt of Tartar, made by Incineration, is made a kind of fixed
Salt, against its own natural property, from the firm Conjunction of the
Volatile Acid, with the Volatile Alcaly, by means of an Igneous Spirit. But you
may easily restore it to its first Volatility, if you do but free it from the
Chains of the Fire, either by separating or augmenting the Acid, or preventing
its Union with the Alcaly.

88. If you desire to make Salt of Tartar, or other incinerated Salts more
white, and to preserve them in their Beauty and Dryness, so as that the Air may
not penetrate or dissolve them, you must (after they are made very dry) mix
them with about a third part of their Weight of Sulphur in fine Powder, and
cause it to burn and consume over a good Charcoal fire: then elixiviate,
filter, and evaporate, in a glass Cucurbit over a Sand-heat, till a scum arises
on the Top, after which let it cool, and set the Salt to Crystalize: the
remaining Liquor evaporate again, till a scum is at top, which set to
Crystalize: this do till you have all the Salt.

89. Salts simply calcined, cannot resist the Penetration of the Air, whereas
the former will: and the reason is, because that in Calcination, no more of the
Acid is retained, than may serve for fixation: so that there is an innumerable
sort of Pores not filled up, being so left by the Violence of the Fire, which
Pores being open, are subject to any kind of penetration, especially that of
the Air. But when they meet an Acid more powerful, such as is that which comes
from Sulphur mixed and burnt with them, in their last Calcination, they fill
themselves so, as to leave no vacuities, whereby the Acid of the Air cannot
break, disunite, or dissolve them.

90. In making Spirit of Tartar, you may put about lbiij or jv. thereof bruised
into a large earthen Retort (well Luted all over) which place in a close
Furnace of Reverberation; make first a gentle fire, which continue so long till
nearly all the aqueous Tartar be drawn off. Then having well fitted and luted
to the Cornute a large Receiver, increase the fire gradatim, till it comes to
the utmost degree of heat, and so great that the Recipient be filled wholly
with White Clouds for a pretty longer season: continue this Fire, till the
Recipient becomes clear again: at what time take away the fire, stop up the
Re^isters of the Furnace, and let the Retort cool. Then unlute the Recipient,
and put the Liqu^r into a large Mattress and long Neck, to which add hard or
well dried Biscuit in Powder lbij. covering it with its Head, luting well the
Juncture; to which also Lute a small Receiver; you must make a Rect fication in
B.M. or in a Sand heat, with a gentle fire; which you may repeat two or three
times with fresh Biscuit, so shall you have a Subtle and Volatile Spirit; full
of Volatile Salt. In this Rectification the Spirit may carry along with it some
particles of the Volatile Salt and Oil; so that you may have at the same time,
a volatile, subtle, yellow, pure Oil, easily to be separated, whose Virtues,
whether for Internal or External Uses, much transcend those of the stinking Oil.

91. This Spirit of Tartar is esteemed a very great Sudorifick, expelling from
the Center to the Circumserence, all malign, pestilensial, poisonous, sharp,
and corrosive Humors, and all such unnatural Juyces as are the Causes of
inveterate Scabs, Scurff, Morphew, Lepr^sy, Erysipelas, Tetters, Ringworms, and
such like, It is powerful in all sorts of Rheumatisms, running Gouts, Quinseys,
Inflammations of the Throat and Tonsillae, Pleurisies, French Pox, opens all
Obstructions of the Liver, Spleen and Bowels, and is prevalent against
Cachexies, Dropsies, Jaundice, Green Sickness, stoppage of the Terms. Dose a j
ad j or ij, in any fit Vehicle. The rectified Oil may be given a gut. ij ad x.
mixed with a little fine Sugar, and given with some fit Liquor.

92. In Sect. 32, 33, and 34. of this Chapter, we treated of making the true
Spirit of Scurvy Grass: But some make it thus: fresh and large Garden
Scurvy Grass two or three Bushels; bruise it well in a Stone or Iron Mortar,
put it into a wooden Vessel, pour on so much Water as will cover it two hands
breadth, or thereabouts: put to it two or three handfuls of Salt, and a small
quantity of Yest; let it stand a few days, till it ferments or works like Ale:
then distill it off in an ordinary Alembick or Copper Vesica Tin'd within: save
the first running, for it is the true Spirit. If you would have it stronger,
rectify or distill it over again upon fresh Scurvy Grass: Save the first running
as before, so will you have a very strong, and the true Essential Spirit of
Scurvy Grass.

93. But now in London several other sorts are Sold, which they call Plain and
Golden, but neither of them the absolutely True. The Plain is thus made: proof
Spirit lbviij, xij, or xvj, plus minus: infuse or steep in it so much Garden
Scurvy Grass, as it can well contain; digest it twelve hours, then distill it
off; and save the first half of what comes off; which distill a second time, and
save the first half as before, and you have that Plain Spirit of Scurvy Grass,
which is commonly Sold: this if you distill over again with fresh Scurvy Grass,
it will be yet stronger.

94. Their Golden Spirit (falsely so called) is thus made. a quart of the former
Spirit, put it in a bottle, and put to it Jallap in gross Powder iij: stop the
Vessel, and let it stand warm in Sand or a gentle B. M. for three or four days,
till you see it grow very red: then decant the clear Tincture: A small Spoonful
in Beer, Ale or Wine, is a moderate Dose: it may be given in cold and moist
Constitutions; but it is perfectly destructive to all such as are of a hot,
dry, and Choleric habit. To such as have occasion to make use of any of these
kind of Spirits, I commend those made by Dr. Pordage, living over against the
Checquer-Inn, in Leather-lane in Holborn, where they may be supplied with such
as are truly and really Good, and much transcending the Vulgar Spirits of
Scurvy Grass, now Sold in London, and other places; yet their price is but 6 a.
the Glass (which is but the half of what the Worser sort are Sold for) so
accommodated for the benefit of the Poor.

95. Although in Sect. 32, 33, 34. and in Sect. 92, 93, 94. we have
sufficiently taught the way of making Spirit of Scurvy Grass, and such as shall
be extremely powerful, and participate vastly of the Virtues of the Herb; yet
this following prescript seems to be more excellent, and may indeed be called
the TRUE way. leaves and flowers of Scurvy Grass, as much as you please, bruise
them, and make them up into Balls (like those of Woad which Dyers use) put them
into a well glased pot, upon which affuse so much Scurvy Grass Water, or rather
Wine of the same Herb, as may supernate or overtop them at the least 4 inches:
keep them very close stopped for three or four days in some cool place, then let
the whole matter, being put into an Alembick be distilled according to Art. The
distilled Water rectify in a Cucurbit, so will the pure, subtle, and volatile
Spirit ascend first, which keep by it self in a Glass close st^pt. Dose a
gut.xv. and xx. or xxx. The remaining may s^rve to make new Spirit withal. Thus
also may be distilled the Spirits of Horse-radishes, of Watercresses,
Garden-cresses, Sciatica-cresses, Bank-cresses, Brook-lime, Mustard seed,
Rocket, etc.

96. Vinegar is a degenerated and corrupted Wine, whose Spirits being
dissipated, its saline or tartarous parts (before depressed) are now moved and
carried forth into a flux. However the Spirituous parts in Vinegar are not
wholly destroyed but suppressed only, whilst the saline are now in a flux:
Because from Vinegar may be distilled a Liquor exceeding hot and burning, like
the Spirit of Wine after this manner. With distilled Vinegar, or spirit of
Vinegar extract a Salt out of Minium, or Lead Calcined, which you may do
plentifully. This Vinegar put into a Retort and distill it: the Vinous and
burning Spirit will be driven into the Receiver; the reason of which is, for
that when the Saline Acid particles of the Vinegar are united with the Salt of
the Lead, the Vinous Spirits yet remaining are then freed; and having obtained
their own right, are easily made to ascend by the heat of fire. Now that these
inflamable or burning Spirits are not produced from the Lead, but are truly
Vinous, appears by this, For that this Salt of the Lead remaining, may be
reduced into Lead again, as we have taught lib. 2. cap. 10. sect. 1. 13.
following.

97. There is an excellent and profitable way to distill an inflamable Spirit
from Sugar, by converting its whole Body into that admirable Sulphur. Thus:
unrefined Sugar lbj: Beer Yest j: put them together in a Barrel, or in any
other wood, on Vessel: put upon it a galton of boiling Waters; mix them well,
and stop the Vessel carelessly; let it stand twenty four hours, at what time
the murter will begin to ferment, and in short time Work so strongly, as to
endanger the breaking of the Vessel were it close stopped, or of too small a
Capacity: Then put all the Liquor into a Glass Cucurbit, covered with its Head
very close Luted, with a Recipient fixed to it: distill in B.M. or in Ashes or
Sand with an in-different or moderate fire, so will a subtle and inflamable
Spirit ascend, and after it a phlegm, which may be separated by rectification.
Put the remaining Liquor undistilled into the first Vessel, to which put the
said Phlegm: cover and stop the whole slightly up, put it into a Cellar for two
months, and then make a new distillation in the former Cucurbit, covered and
luted as before, so will you have an inflamable Spirit with Phlegm, which
rectify, as aforesaid; and you will find that the two rectified Spirits put
together, will weigh as much as the Sugar, which was first taken to be
distilled; by which it is manifest, that its whole Body was converted into a
volatile and burning Spirit, as aforesaid.

98. After the same manner you may draw an Inflamable Spirit from Manna, and in
equal quantity with the former, having the same Virtues and Uses with that, and
these both with the best rectified spirit of Wine.

99. You may also distill it alone in a Cucurbit of Glass, or in a Glass Retort,
leaving about or at least of the said Vessels empty, in a sandheat with a
moderate fire: so will you have first a Phlegm; then increasing the fire by
degrees, and distilling to perfect dryness, you will have an acid spirit, whose
Empyreuma you must take away by rectification. This you may either mix with the
first Water, or keep it by it self; being powerful to provoke Sweat; as also to
dissolve Sulphur, and to draw from thence a Tincture good for Diseases of the
Breast and Lungs. Dose of them mixed ss ad jss. in Carduus Water: of the Spirit
alone a gut. jv ad xx. or more. The Tincture of Sulphur drawn therewith may be
given a gut jv. ad xij.

100. In the distillation of Cloves, you ought to make first a kind of
Putrefaction, that the Particles of the Cloves may have a more entire
dissolution: for thereby the volatile and oily parts will be the more easily
separated from the Terrene. Cloves lbj. bruise them grossly, put them with fair
Water lbjv. into a Glass Cucurbit with a Vessel of Rencounter, very well luted:
put it about fourteen, sixteen or eighteen days to digest in a sand
putrefactive heat; unlute the Vessels, and put all into a Copper Vesica well
Tin'd within, and covered with its refrigeratory; put it into a proper Furnace,
and Lute the Junctures well, with the Receiver also, then distill forthwith,
with a quick Coal-fire, shifting as occasion requires the Water of the
Refrigeratory: continue till about of the humidity is drawn off: Then let the
Vessels stand till they are half cold, and decant the spirituous Water from the
Oil which will be in the bottom of the Receiver: put the Oil into a glass,
keeping it close stopped: the spirituous Water cohobate upon the Magma, and
distill again, as before; so will you have more Oil, which would not arise upon
the first Distillation: this Oil put to the former, and keep the Water by it
self for other uses.

101. After the Putrefaction, as aforesaid, for fourteen, sixteen or eighteen
days, you may also distill the M^ss in a Glass Retort in a Sand heat over an
mo^fferent fire, so will you have Oil and Water, as aforesaid, which Water may
be coh^bated upon the Magma, as in the former. But if you distill the Cloves in
a Glass Retort without the Addition of Water, you will have a faetid Oil,
having a strong Empyreuma. And after these several ways you may distill Nutmegs,
Mace, Cubebs, Cardamoms, Pepper, Jamaica Pepper, and other Ar^maticks, but
chiefly after the method at Sect. 100. above.

102. Most Authors teach several ways to distill Camphir, but truly in Vain; for
considring its purity, subtilty, volatility, penetration, transparency,
whiteness, piercing taste, strong scent, quick dissipation, even without fire,
inflamability even in Water, and total Consumption of all its parts, if set on
fire, without any Faeces or Ashes remaining; we may strongly conclude it to be
a Gum so perfect, that nothing of Art can either purify, mend, or exalt it; but
rather diminish its native excellency and power. But if any should rather
desire it liquid, than in its natural form, they may dissolve it either in
rectified S.V. or in Oil of sweet Almonos, or in the C^ymical Oils of Limons,
O. anges, Rosmary, Sassafras, and the like. Authors have accounted it to be
cold; but it is certainly hot, both in all its parts, and in o^eration, as the
before enumerated qualities do sufficiently demonstrate. It is a most admirable
Hysteric, against fits and vapors of the Womb: and a very great Antidote in
contagi^us and pestilential Times, resisting the Putrefaction of humors; yea it
is of excellent use even to smell to. Dose a gr.j. ad iij, or jv, and sometimes
more, either in Powder, or dissolved as aforesaid. You may give it in Hysteric
Clysters a gr. jv ad xij. A grain or two may be put into a hollow Tooth, or
dissolved in S.V. to ease the pain of the Toothach: Camphir is said to make the
very best and whitest of all Varnishes.

103. Turpentine may be distilled by putting lbij or iij. of it, into a large
Glass Retort in a Sand-heat, with a moderate fire, especially at first: so will
you have first an Acid Spirit with Water; then a clear Aetherial Volatile
Inflamable Oil, after a pale yellow or Limon colored; after that, a perfect
yellow colored; and lastly, a red Oil, leaving a Colophony in the bottom. If
you use a long recipient with just degrees of heat, and do not change it till
the end of the distillation, you may perceive all these Oils swiming one above
another, the red at bottom, the yellow next, the Lemon above that, then white,
and lastly the aetherial at the Top. These Oils have all of them nearly the
same Virtues; but those which are lowest and highest colored operate less
powerfully than those which are higher, and lesser colored, for as much as
these are much more subtle, volatile, and pure.

104. After this very manner you may distill the like Oils of Mastich, observing
the degrees of Fire; and this way is indeed much better than all the other ways
which Authors teach, for as much as in this way, there is no Foreign matter
mixed with the Mastich, whereby its nature and qualities should be altered; nor
in this way, does it need any rectification. Oil of Mastich prevails against
Weakness of the Stomach and Bowels, helps in a Diarrhoea, heals and and
consolidates Wounds and Ulcers, both of the Breast and Lungs, and other inward
parts of the Body: it closes up the Orifices of the Veins and Arteries, and
stays all fluxes of Blood. Dose in any proper Vehicle a gut. jv ad xvj.
Outwardly it strengthens the Stomach and Belly, heals Wounds of the Nerves and
all other parts; and C^ solidates, being used by way of Injection, with a
mixture in some other proper Liquor. In Fractures and Dislocatitions, it
comforts and fort^fies the Bones and Joints.

105. Take of the best Benj unin poudred lbj: put it into a large Glass Retort,
having a Neck of the longest and largest size: assuse thereon S.V. lbiij. stir
them well together: digest in a very gentle heat (with the Neck upright) for
twenty four hours, shaking them often to hasten the dissolution of the
Benjamin. Then put the Retort into a Sandheat, sitting to its Neck (instead of
a Vessel of Rencounter) a Glass well luted in a Vessel of Water, and with a
moderate fire, distill first the S.V. after which the flowers of Benjamin will
ar^se; but as soon as they appear; set a new Receiver well dried, in the room
of the former, and lute it sl^ghtly, that you may be able to (...) out from
time to time the flowers that shall fall into it, as also those that shall stay
in the Neck of the Retort: these flores put up into a Glass well stopped, and put
the Receiver into its p^ace again; Lute it now very strongly, so will a thick
Liquor distill, which will be the first Oil of Benjamin, which you will distill
with the same fire: if you continue it you will have an Acid Liquor, and after
that a yellow, clear, and odoriferous Oil; and then the last Oil, which will be
greasy and thick.

106. In the former process, you have, 1. A T^^cture of Benjamin, which is found
in the first Dissolution in S.V. and contains all the good parts of the
Benjamin. 2. By distillation, a spirit of Wine impregnated with particles of
the Volatile Salt of Benjamin, conjoined with some part of its sulphurous
Particles, which is an excellent Medicine to provoke Sweat, being given in a
proper Venicle a ss ad ij. 3. Flowers, white like Snow, in long Crystals, sweet
and delectable in scent, and of a subtle and penetrating Substance, which may
be called the true volatile and sulphurous Salt of Benjamin: These flowers if
you desire them only, you may obtain thus: Put ij or iij of Benjamin poudred
into a long pot of Potters Earth, put it into a Sand-heat, cover it with a long
Cornute of thick Paper, whose Mouth let be fited, or proportionable to the
Circumference of the Pot, and let it be fastened with Pack-thread about the
same. Then make a moderate fire, so will the light flowers of Benjamin arise
and stick to the inside of the Cornute. 4. From these flores, with the before
distilled Spirits, you may draw a Tincture, more pure and subtle, than what you
drew before from the gross Benjamin, which will provoke Sweat in lesser Dose
than the former Tincture: Both this and the Flowers are very admitable
Pectorals. 5 Yel^ low Oil which is a perfume, and in virtue much like the
Flowers. 6. Thick greasy Oil, which is only used to cleanse and consolidate
Ulcers. After the same manner you may distill Storax.

107. Red Myrrh in fine powder lbj: put it into a large glass Retort affuse
thereon rectified spirit of Wine lbjv: stir them very well, and digest for
twelve hours, shaking the glass often: Then put the Retort into a Sand-heat,
fit and lute to it a half Ball, or very large Recipient, and begin the
distillation with a very gentle fire, increasing it by degrees, but very
slowly, and more especially toward the end, the better to draw forth the
olegainous parts of the Myrrh: the spirit of Wine being first drawn forth,
remove it and apply another Recipient, which luting well, distill to dryness.
Then, the Vessels being cold, separate the spirit of Wine remaining from the
Oil of Myrrh. This Oil of Myrrh mix with equal weight of Vitriol calcined to
whiteness, and rectify it in a Glass Retort in a Sand-heat, with a moderate
fire, so will you have a pure Oil of Myrrh, free from earthy parts, which are
left behind in the Vitriol. But by reason the Vitriol may give some Acrimony to
the Oil, you must free it from it thus: Take Ox or. Sheeps Bones calcined to
powder, the equal weight of Oil, Fountain water four times as much: mix all
together, and distill in a glass Alembick all of a piece in a Sand-heat, and
well luted to a small Receiver, so will you have a pure yellow clear Oil of
Myrrh free from all Impurities. It is a notable Hysteric, resists Poison and
the Putrefaction of Humors, opens Obstructions of the Bowels and kills Worms.
D^se a gut.iij ad vij, mixed with fine Sugar, and dissolved in a proper Vehicle;
Or you may mix it with proper Pills, Opiates, etc.

108. Gum Ammoniack (so called from the place of its Growth, which was near and
about the Temple or Oracle of Jupiter Ammon, the place of its natural
production) is thus distilled: of the said Gum lbj: put it into a glass Retort,
large, deep, and fit to hold ten times as much of the same: and in a Sand-heat
(having first luted a large Receiver to its Neck) with a gentle fire begin the
distillation; this gentle heat continue till all the danger of the swelling is
over; then by little and little increase the fire, and at last a violent fire,
that the Oil may be completely separated from the Gum; when you see the
Receiver clear from Fumes, let the fire go out, and the Vessels cool; then
unlute them, and in the Receiver you will have an Acid Spirit containing the
Volatile Salt, mixed with much phlegm, and a thick stinking Oil.

109. All these you may rectify by putting to them Bones calcined to powder
lbj: put all into a glass Cucurbit luted with its Head and Receiver, and in a
Sand-heat with a moderate fire begin the Distillation, so you will have first the
pure Volatile Spirits, Salt and Oil to ascend; the Phlegm and more gross part of
the oil remain at the bottom of the Cucurbit. You may rectify again with new
Bone-Ashes the whole distiliation, and at last separate the Volatile Oil from
the Volatile Saline, spirituous part. The Spirit opens all Obstructions of the
Liver, Spleen and Bowels, is good against the Dropsy, Cholick, Cachexia,
Green Sickness, and stoppage of Urine: It is also a most noble Hysteric, and
powerfully provokes the Terms, given after other general remedies: Dose a
gut.vj ad xx, in White Wine, Rhenish, Sack, or other proper Vehicle; The Oil is
given for the same intentions a gut. ij ad viij. mixed with Sugar, etc. or given
in Pills, Opiates, etc. They both hasten and bring away both Birth and
Afterbith. In Hysteric sits, you may also anoint the Nostrils with the Oil.
Thus may you distill Galbanum, Opopanax, Sagapenum, and other watery Gums of
like Nature.

110. Joel Langelot a learned man and Physician to the Duke of Holtsatia, makes
Laudanum Helmontij thus: Take Thebian Opium cut small lb j: juice of very ripe
Quinces newly drawn lb x: Salt of Tartar j: digest all two days in a very
gentle Sand Heat, or till you see little Bubbles appear above the Liquor, which
is a sign that Fermentation is at hand: Then add thereto fine Sugar in Powder
iv: and use a moderate heat to advance the fermentation: so will the Opium rise
and totally dissolve. At top of the Liquor will be a filthy impure and scummy
part which swims; at bottom will be an impure and earthy part: and in the
middle will be a pure and transparent Liquor, as red as a Ruby, which separate,
filterate and keep for Use. This in the true Laudanum of Helmont, and is given
a gut. x. ad xx or xxx: but forth greater perfection you may inspissate to the
Consistency of an Extract. and then dissolve that Extract in pure rectified S.
V. which filter and digest for one month, to ripen it, and bring it to
Perfection: Then inspissage again to the Consistency of an Extract. From this
the said Langelot promises wonderful things in all Cases where Laudanum is to
be used, giving at a time not above a quarter, or at most but half a grain.
This small Dose is imputed to the union and close binding up of the parts of
the Opium, first by Fermentation, and then reducing them to an Extract.

111. This Laudanum now described induces Rest, allays the sharpness of humors,
and stops their motion. It for tifies Nature and the parts; it corroborates all
the Bowels cherishes the natural heat, restores the retentive Faculty
debilitated, stops all fluxes of Blood in man or woman, the overflowing of the
Terms, all sorts of Fluxes of the Belly, and other thin and corroding
Defluxions either upon the Eyes, Ears, Teeth, Throat, Lungs, Stomach, or any
other part external or internal. It cases all pains of the head arising from
attenuated humors, taken inwardly, or applied to the forehead and Temples. It
discusses and expels wind, and takes awaynoises in the Ears: It eases the
Toothache, ^tops Vomiting after Evacuation, and all other violent Purgations
and Fermen^ations of the humors. It gives ease in the Disease Cholera, and the
windy Cholick, and in all griping Pains in man or woman, both given by the
mouth and by O^sters: It is a powerful Remedy against the Gravel, Stone, and
the Dissentery, both to cease the Fermentation of the humors, and to abate
their acrimony after due purgation. It is successful in all diseases of Reins
and Bladder, the Gonorrhaea, etc. It strengthens the Spermatick Vessels, and
cures all sorts of Gouts and Rhumatisms, and is prevalent against all Pains in
any part or person, from what cause soever, in any age or sex, and at any time
whatsoever, especially after the use of general Remedies, and fit, due or
previous Evacuations.

112. What the oily volatile Salt of Sylvius is, is scarcely truly known, yet
one Monsieur Telingius Professor of Physic at Ryntel, in his Prodromi^ Praxeos
Chymiatricae, gives us this Des^ription there it: Aromatic spirit i: Volatile
Sal Armoniack ij: Tincture of Cloves, gut vj: mix them well in a glass which
keep close stopped: let it stand all night, and separate the clear by inclination
from the powder at the Bottom: so have you a volatile dyly Salt: or an
Aromatic Spirit, charged with a volatile Salt of a pleasing Taste and Smell;
which by reason of the Purity and Subtilty of its parts is able to attenuate
and discuss bad humors, and to expel them through the Pores: also to rectify
and preserve the Tone of the Stomach, whose prevarication is the root of all
Diseases. This Medicament is of use against all cold Distempers, proceeding
from Acid juyces or ferments: Dose a gut. x. ad xx or xxx, in any proper
Vehicle. This is Telingius his supposed oily Volatile Salt of Sylvius: but we
desire to be excused, if we say, We believe it to be absolutely another thing,
or almost insinite, or as manifold, as there are hot Vegetables in Nature: from
all of which a volatile oily Salt may be prepared, as from Rosmary, Lavender,
Fennel, Juniper berries, Cloves, Mace, Cinnamon, Nutme^s, Wormwood, Angelica,
Sage, etc. The preparation of which, from any hot vegetable we may hereafter
(God willing) discover.

113. The Recipe of Telingius his Aromatic Spirit aforesaid, biting Cinnamon
ij: Red Roses j ss: Aniseeds vj: Cardamums ij: Barberry grains ij: yellow
Sanders, Nu^megs, Cubebs, A. ij: bruise the ingredients (all but the Roses) mix
them, and affuse thereon S.V. rectified lb vj: Rainwater lb j: put them into a
glass Cucurbit, which cover with its head well luted, and place it in a Sand
heat with a Receiver luted to its Beak, digest with a very gentle heat for 24
hours: then distill according to Art. This is a good Stomatick, and a Cordial
which may be given in all Diseases. But for the purpose aforesaid of Telingius,
the Aqua Vitae Matthioli, which is the Aqua caelestis of the shops, is
infinitely more excellent.

114. The preparation of Our Family Pills, which is twofold, viz. either with
or without Aloes.

1. Pilulae-familias nostrae cum Aloe: Our Family Pills with Aloes.

The Angelical Pills of Grulingius, or fine Aloes twice prepared with Juice of
Violets and inspissated to the thickness of an Extract, viij: Resinous Scammony
jv: Resin of Jallap iij: Guta G^mba, extractum benedictum ( in our Pharm. Land.
lib. 4. cap. 8 sect. 32.) A. ij Tartar Vitriolate, Elaterium, A. j ss: Extract
of Saffron, Powder of Cloves, Mace, Nutmegs, Castoreum A. j: Oil of Rosemary,
or of Cloves ss: mix them; and with Syrupus de spina Cervina q.s. make a mass
of Pills.

It is a most admirable thing for a general purge; there is nothing better yet
known; for it purges all humors, in all persons, and may be given to all Sexes
and Ages (except only little Infants.) It specifically cures Scurvy, Dropsy,
Gout, Consumption, Jaundice, Cachexia and Green Sickness: It opens all
Obstructions of the Liver, Spleen, Mesentery and Womb: It cleanses the Stomach
and Bowels from corrupt humors, and all manner of filth: It kills worms whether
in old or young. It is an excellent thing against all Agues and Fevers, by
causing the Evacuation of the Febritick matter. It provokes the Terms
powerfully, nor is there any other purging Medicament which is equal to it. It
purifies the blood, strengthens the stomach, expels Choler, and provokes
Appetite: It evacuates thick phlegm, and other gross humors from the head,
joints, and other remote Parts. It has been found of excellent use in
Lethargies, Carus, Vertigoes, Old Headaches, Megrims, Epilepsies, Apoplexies,
and other the like cold and moist Diseases of the Head and Brain. Being often
taken, they cause old Ulcers, running Sores, and malignant and inveterate
Fistulaes to heal speedily. It is a most admirable Remedy against the Pox,
especially if to every ounce thereof be added of Turbeth Mineral i ss: or of
Artificial Cinnabar j ss ad iij: otherwise the Prescript it self is inferior
to no other Purge: It cleanses, strengthens and corroborates all parts of the
Head and stomach, drys up Catarrhs, comforts the Memory, accuates the Senses;
prevails against tartarous Diseases, Melancholy and the Kings Evil, for which
last I esteem't the best of all purges. It evacuat's water powerfully, and
cures any Surfeit, if exhibited upon the first coming thereof. I also commend
the use hereof in the Gout, Dropsy and Jaundice, beyond all other Purgatives
known by me, for in those Diseases I have had large experience thereof: and
indeed in most Diseases of the womb proceeding from cold, moisture, wind,
Obstructions, and variety of filthy humors, I have done wonders therewith: for
it opens, cleanses, warms, comforts, and strengthens that part to a Miracle. I
have given this Medicine with good Success in quartan Agues, black Jaundice,
and hypochondriack Melancholy. Dose j ad ss See our Pharm. Land. lib. 4. cap.
23. sect. 96. where you have also the way and manner of taking it.

2. Pilulae-familias nostrae sine Aloe: Our Family-Pills without Aloes.

The Preparation, Virtues, Use, and Dose thereof you may see lib. 2. cap. 23.
sect. 16. following of this work. This without Aloes is more generally given in
Families then the former; but that with Aloes is the more general Medicine: My
Rule in giving them is this: In all cold, moist, pituitous and melancholy
habits and constitutions, I give of the Composition without Aloes: but in all
hot, dry and choleric Constitutions, I commonly give of the Composition with
Aloes; and sometimes I give them alternately, viz. first of the one Compositum
then of the other, which I have found to be of singular advantage both in
respect of sex, and humors abounding.

II. Observations on Animals.
115. Bees are for the most part calcined, or so dried to be reduced to a
Powder, which being mixed with oil of Nuts, is anointed upon bald places to
cause the hair to grow: if you distill them in a Retort, you will have a
Volatile Spirit and Oil, which will provoke Sweat; and if given in its largest
Dose, expel from the Reins and Bladder, Gravel slime and Urine.

116. Honey which is their product, and is gathered from the most odoriferous
parts of Plants, or their flowers and fruits, is thus distilled: Honey lbj: put
it into a Copper Vesica very large and high, and well tin'd within, put it upon
a little Furnace covexed with its head, and sit to its beak a small receiver,
luting the joints well, distill with a fire so small as that the Honey may not
boil, but be a little more than warm: so will you have a clear and odoriferous
water, with an acid spirit, inclining to yellow, which will grow deeper and
deeper as you increase your sire: and at last the oil will ascend. Keep apart
the water which ascends first: separate the Oil from the acid spirit, by means
of a sheet of Cap-Paper, first wet in the aforesaid water put into a glass
Funnel: and rectify the spirit by evaporating the phlegm in B.M. The water is
aperitive and diuretic, especially if mixed with some of the Spirit, and so
mixed they cause hair to grow, cure Diseases of the Eyes, as the Suffusion, Pin
and Web, Pearl, Ophthalmia, etc. The rectified spirit alone dissolves Iron,
Lead, and other Metals.

117. Take Castoreum fre'd from its unctuous parts and skins: shred it small,
put it into a Mattress, upon which affuse S.V. rectified so much as to overtop
it the breadth of four fingers: Digest in a gentle heat a Month, shaking the
Vessel once or twice aday: then strain by hard pressing out; which keep in a
glass bottle close stopped: This is Tincture of Castoreum.

118. But if you rather desire a spirit, put the whole Mass, before Straining,
into a Glass Cucurbit, with a Head and small Receiver both well Luted, and
distill in a Sandheat with a moderate fire, so will all the most pure,
spirituous and volatile parts of the Castor ascend; of the Magma you may make
an Extract. Dose of the Tincture and Spirit are both the same, viz. a ss ad ij.
They are good Cephalicks, Stomaticks and Hystericks.

118. Cantharides dry and whole, may be put into a Glass or earthen Retort
Luted round, so many as to fill (...) full: to which luting a large Receiver,
and distilling in a close Reverberatory with a gradual fire, you will have a
Volatile Salt and Oil accompanied with Phlegm. This distilled matter put into a
Bolt-head with a long neck, lated to its proper Head, and a small Receiver, and
in a Sand-heat with a moderate fire make a Rectification; so will the Volatile
Salt presently ascend white and crystaline, which put into a glass Bottle with
as much speed as may be, and stop it close up. Put to another Head and Receiver
in the place of the former, and continuing the fire draw forth the Oil and the
rest of the Volatile Salt dissolved in some small part of the Phlegm: lastly
separate the Oil from the Phlegm, and keep each a part in Glasses close stopped.

119. This Volatile Salt is said to be the most powerful of all Diuretics, so
that is will break the Stone, and dissolve it, both in the Reins and Bladder:
you may give it in Opiates, or some Bolus, from gr.j. ad vj. being less
dangerous than the Flies themselves. The Oil and Liquor have both the same
Virtues. They all of them provoke Lust exceedingly, yea beyond all other
things, being thus mixed: Salt or Oil of Cantharides, Oil of Cloves, A. j: Oil
of Nutmegs by expression ss: liquid Storax ss: mix, and anoint the Testicles,
Perinaeum, and the Soles of the Feet therewith.

120. Crabs of the River, may be distilled in an Earthen Retort, in a close
Reverberatory, so will you have Volatile Salt and Oil. They may be distilled
also thus. Bruise them well in an Iron Mortar, put them into a glass Cucurbit,
luting to its Head and Receiver; and distill a Water therefrom in a Sandheat to
dryness: Cohobate seven times, so will the Volatile Salt ascend with the Water.
The Magma calcine, and get its Salt by Elixiviation the ordinary way, which
dissolve in the before distilled water. It is a great Diuretic, and is said to
dissolve the Stone in the Reins and Bladder, and to restore such as are
Consumptive. Dose from one spoonful to four.

121. Frogs may be cut in pieces, and in a glass Cucurbit may be distilled in
B. M. with a gentle fire, which you may cohobate six or seven times, so have
you a Water of great use in the Gout, and in all Internal pains of the Reins,
Ureters, and Bladder. The Magma may be distilled in an Earthen Retort well
Luted, in a close Reverberatory with a long Receiver, as Vipers are distilled,
so will you have a Volatile Salt and Oil with much Phlegm, which you may rectify
and separate. The Virtues of them are much like to those of the Toad. Also if
Frogs be calcined to Ashes; those Ashes by strewing or blowing them on, stop
Bleeding in any part: they also cause Hair to grow: and given inwardly j ad j,
they stop a Gonorrhoea.

122. Hartshorn of old used to be calcined in an Actual fire, but so it looses
all its pure and volatile parts: Chemists used to calcine it, by hanging thin
slices of it a long time in the Fumes of Cordial Herbs and Plants, in the time
of Distillation, and then to reduce it to fine Powder; this is the
Philosophical Calcination, and is better than the former. But truly crude
Hartshorn rasped, dried gently, and laevigated, much exceeds them both.
Hartshorn is distilled in a Retort in a close Furnace of Reverberation, being
first Sawed into little Bits, so have you Volatile Salt, Oil, and Spirit of
Hartshorn, which you may rectify, separate, and keep a part in Glasses close
stopped. This rectification may be made by mixing it with Hartshorn calcined. The
Virtues, Use, and Dose are the same with those of Man's Skull.

123. After the same manner may you both prepare and also distill Ivory, and the
Bones of Whales and other Living Creatures, so have you Volatile Salts, Oil,
and Spirit, which you may rectify and separate, etc. Ivory thus distilled to
the highest degree of heat, leaves black pieces in the bottom of the Retort, of
which Painters make their true Velvet black, which can never be perfectly in an
open fire. Those black pieces being farther calcined in an open Fire, in a
Potters Furnace, to a perfect whiteness, is that which the Ancients called
Spodium.

124. Man's Skull rasped, dried, beaten and levigated, is a most admirable thing
in the Falling Sickness, Palsy, Convulsion, and sits of the Mother: this is the
first, most simple and easy preparation. Calcination destroys its volatile
part, and leaves the remaining part worth little. Distillation follows: Take
Skulls of men killed by a violent Death, saw and beat them into small pieces,
put them into an earthen Retort very well Luted, which put into a close Furnace
of Reverberation, which cover with its Capsula, stopping also the Registers,
the hole of the Fire place, and almost the Ash-hole; make a fire with Charcole,
which keep in an equal heat for about 2 hours in the Ash-hole: then remove it
out of the Ash-hole into the Fire place, increase it by degrees, and lute to a
large Receiver, opening the Registers by degrees, and continuing a moderate
fire, till the Phlegm begins to fall into the Recipient. Then increase the Fire
to one degree, by giving more Air, so will the Volatile Salt Spirits ascend,
accompanied with Oil, in white Clouds, then increasing the fire one degree more
opening the Registers at fit times, till they are all open, and the fire is
come to the highest degree of heat, you shall distill till no more Clouds come
out of the Retort, and the Receiver becomes perfectly clear; then let the
Vessels cool, and unluting them, you will have in the Receiver Volatile Salt,
Oil, Spirit, and Phlegm, which you may rectify, separate and keep a part.

125. These several Substances you may rectify, by putting them together into a
Mattress with a long Neck, placed in a Sand-heat, and covered with its Head
perfectly well luted with a proper Receiver, observing the same method as in
the Rectification and Separation of Hartshorn and other like things. These
wonderfully cure all Diseases of the Head and Brain, but chiefly the Epilepsy,
Apoplexy, and Convulsions; and by reason they are freed from their wany and
terrestrial parts, do operate with great celerity, and are imcomparably more
powerful than the crude Skull, for that the Stomach causes them to pass both
with ease and swifness to the Brain, and all the remote parts of the Body: the
Oil, as well as the Salt may both be taken inwardly; but the Salt is
preferable, for that it is somewhat more Volatile, pure, and pleasant both to
the taste and smell as well as the fight. Dose of the Salt gr.vj. ad xx or xxx:
of the rectified Oil a gut. jv ad xij: and of the Spirit a gut. xx. ad lx: in
any proper Conserve or Cephalic Opiate. From the rasped Skull well dried and
poudred you may with highly rectified S.V. or very strong Cinnamon Water,
extract an excellent Tincture having the same Virtues. Dose a j ad ij. or more.

126. Take Blood (taken from healthy young men, not having red Hair) put it
into several Earthen Cucurbits, filling them only a quarter full, to which Lute
their Heads and small Receivers: draw off the phlegm in a gentle Sand-heat to
just dryness, but not so that the Magma be in the least Burnt, this Phlegm keep
in a Glass. These several Magmata put into a great glass Retort well luted to
its Receiver, which place in a close Furnace of Reverberation: distill with a
gradual fire, flow and gentle at first, but by degrees increase it to the
highest; so will you have a new Water, Oil, and Volatile Salt, coming forth in
white Clouds, and condensing in the Receiver: These various substances rectify,
separate and keep apart, as we have before taught, which you may repeat if you
so please to an exact purity. The Virtues and Doses of these are the same with
the like Substances from Man's Skull: they are also all of them admirable
Hystericks. Helmont says, The Volatile Salt and Oil of Man's Blood will cure
the Falling sickness even in elderly persons.

127. However this is certain, That they cure all Diseases of the Brain and
Nerves; purify the whole Mass of Blood, radically destroy the Scurvy; make the
Blood fluid, and help its Circulation: They dissipate vapors arising from the
Stomach, Liver, Spleen, and other Viscera, but more especially those of the
Womb: they destroy the malignity of Fevers though contagious and pestilential,
cure the Dropsy, and Palsy, and ease the pains of the Gont.

128. Urine may be distilled after a putrefaction in Horse-dung for forty days,
because then the Volatile Salt will the more easily ascend: being putrified,
take the clear Urine which swims above the Sediment, and distill in B. M. or an
ash heat, with a very gentle fire: the distilled Liquor rectify three or four
times in a Mattress with a long Neck, but with the longer Neck for the last
rectification of the Salt: so have you a pure, subtle, volatile white Salt,
with a volatile Spirit, which is only part of the Phlegm, in which some of the
Salt is dissolved: but in respect putrified Urine stinks so abominably, late
Artists take the fresh Urine and evaporate it away till it become as thick as
new Honey in B. M. or in a Sandheat: then they destil it in a large high
Cucurbit with its Head and Receiver as before: rectif^ing the Liquor as the
former, which is indeed as good a way, and far less noisome.

129. This Salt and Spirit of Urine, destroys acids in M^ns Body, allays
fermentations; opens Obstructions of the Stomach, Liver, Spleen, Lungs,
Mesentery and Womb, purifys the Mass of Blood, cures the Scurvy, Cachexy,
Jaundice, Hypochondriack Melancholy; all cold Diseases of the Head and Brain,
as Lethargy, Apoplexies, Epile sies, Convulsions, Palsies, Mother fits,
Obstructions of the Urine, Stone, Gravel, slime and filth in the Reins and
Bladder, in which last cases they are specificks: outwardly they ease pains of
the Gout and Rhumatisms. Dose of the Salt gr.x. ad ss. in any proper Vehicle.

130. M^ns Dung being dried and distilled in a Retort, yields a Volatile Oil,
singular and specific for the Cure of exulcerate Frysipela's, Scald-Heads,
Scurss, Scabs, etc. and to mortify Cancers, and assuage the pains of the Gout
being applied.

131. Toads thoroughly dried are to be cut into pieces, and then put into an
Earthen or Glass Retort well luted, and in a close Reverberatory with a gradual
fire, you will have a Volatile Salt and Oil accompanied with some Phlegm,
altogether in the Receiver: which you may rectify and separate in a Mattress
with a long Neck, in a Sand-heat, with a gentle fire. The Virtues are almost
the same with the like substance produced from the Viper: but the Volatile Salt
of Toads is said to be a specific in the Dropsy; especially if mixed with a
little of the fixed Salt of the faeces. The Bone of the foremost left Leg of a
Toad, held against an Aching Tooth, eases (as Helmont, says) the pain. The
dried Powder of the whole Animal put upon Buboes, or pestilential Carbuncles,
draws forth the malignity, as also it does in Cancers, and Venerial Sores.

132. Storks, being deplumed and embowled, may be cut into small pieces, and
put into a glass Cucurbit in a Sand-heat, where it may be covered with its Head
and luted to a Receiver: distill with a moderate fire almost to dryness: the
distilled Water keep apart by it self: the Magma put into a Retort of Earth,
or of Glass well luted about; place it in a close Reverberatory, and in a
Receiver luted thereto, distilling with a gradual fire, till it comes to the
highest, you will have a Volatile Salt, Oil, and Phlegm, which rectify,
separate, and keep apart, as we have formerly taught. This Salt, Oil, and
Spirit, are Counter-Poysons, and good against contagious and epidemick
Diseases. They are also a specific against the Fallingsickness. Dose of the
Salt gr. x. ad ss: of the Oil a gut. iij ad x. incorporated with Sugar: of the
Spirit a j ad ij: give them fasting either in their own proper Water, or
Cinnamon Water, Bolus, or proper Opiate.

133. Millepedes, Sows, or Hog-lice, are distilled ^y putting them alive at
first into a Retort, and distilling them in a close Reverberatory Furnace, with
a moderate fire increasing it by degrees to the highest; so will you have a
volatile Salt, Oil, and much Phlegm; which by rectifying, as aforesaid, you will
have a pure, white, crystaline, and volatile Salt, a pure volatile Oil, and
subtle Spirit, having all one and the same Virtues, though in different degrees
of strength: these are Diaphoretick, purify the Mass of Blood, and expel its
impurities by transpiration: they powerfully mortify Acids, and therefore cure
old stubborn Ulcers, Cancers, Jaundice, and the Scurvy: they ease pains of the
Gout, Rheumatisms, and other dolors of the Nerves: Their Bodies dried, in a
gentle heat and pulverised are a powerful Diuretic, being given a j ad j, in
White or Rhenish Wine.

134. After the same manner may you distill Earthworms, and have from them the
same substances, which have completely together the same Virtues. Now here is
one thing worthy of noting, viz. That if the Volatile Salts be dissolved in the
acid Spirit, and then be mixed with double the weight of pure Salt of Tartar; if
you distill or sublime the said mixture, the Acid will quit the Volatile Salt,
and join it self to the fixed Salt of Tarrar, whereby the Volatile Salt will
totally sublime, and leave the Spirit only an insipid Phlegm, mixed with the
said Portion of fixed Salt which was added.

135. Pismires after the fame manner may be distilled, and from whom you may
have the same Substances: whose Virtues are powerfully to open Obstructions of
the Reins, Ureters and Bladder, dissolve and bring away Stones, Sand, Gravel
and Slime, and after a mighty manner to provoke Lust, inwardly taken and
outwardly applied. Or thus: Pismires or Ants in Harvesttime, put them into a
Mattress, upon which affuse well in rectified spirit of Wine, or Aqua Caelestis
( which is the Aqua Vitae Matthioli) made with rectified spirit of Wine; or the
best Cinnamon Water made with the best rectified spirit of Wine, so much as to
overtop them three Inches: digest in a gentle heat till the Ants are converted
into Liquor: then unstopping the Mattress, put all into a glass Cuourbit, to
which lute its Head, and in a Sand-heat (having a Receiver also well luted to
the Head) with a very gentle fire begin the Distillation, and continue it till
all is almost come over: then cool the Vessels, and put the Volatile spirituous
water (full of Volatile Salt) into a glass Bottle, which keep close stopped for
use. It cherishes and strengthens the natural heat, provokes Urine, restores in
Consumptions, causes magnaminity of Mind, and mightily provokes Lust. Dose from
half a spoonful to one spoonful mixed with choice Canary, or a little
Cinnamon Water.

136. Take a Peacock deplume and embowel him; cut him to bits and bruise them
well: and in a glass Cucurbit with its Head and Receiver draw off a Water,
distilling to dryness: this Water strengthens the Brain, and fortifies it
against Diseases. The dry Magma put into an Earthen or glass Retort luted all
over, in which, in a Reverberatory Furnace (as before is taught) with a
graduated fire distill a pure Volatile Salt and Oil, mixed with phlegm; which
substances rectify, separate, and keep apart, as we have formerly taught. The
white, crystaline and volatile Salt is of great Virtue, especially against the
Falling Sickness and Vertigo, and indeed all other Diseases of the Brain,
anointing also the Nostrils, Temples, and Sutures of the Skull with the Oil.

137. Peacocks dung may after the same manner be distilled in an Earthen or
Glass Retort, from whence volatile Salt, Oil, and Spirit will be drawn, which
may be rectified, separated, and kept a part, as aforesaid: these Substances
have the same Virtues with those distilled from the Peacock it self, and may be
given in the same Dose. Tincture of dry Peacocks dung drawn in rectified Spirit
of Wine, is given for the same purposes: so also the dried Dung either infused
in White Wine, or given in substance to one dram: it is a specific against the
Epilepsy and Vertigo, more especially if given at the New and Full Moon.

138. Vipers are also distilled (being first killed and then gently dried in
warm Ovens after the Bread is drawn forth, till they will as it were beat to
Powder) by cutting them into little bits, viz. the whole Viper, Heads, Tails,
Skins, Hearts, Livers, Bones, Intrails and Flesh, both of Male and Female, and
putting them into an Earthen or Glass Retort, coated all over, so as it may be
almost quite full, in a close Reverberatory, with a moderate fire, gradually
increasing it, by opening the Registers, to the highest degree of heat,
continuing it so till the Recipient is clear and cool, you will have (as in the
former operations) Volatile Salt and Oil, with some Phlegm, which, in a glass
Mattress with a long Neck in a Sand-heat with a moderate fire, and a fit Head
and Receiver firmly luted, you may rectify, separate, and keep apart: the
volatile, white, crystaline Salt will stick to the top of the Head, which put
into a strong glass Bottle stopping it very close: the Oil and Spirit separate:
the Caput Mort. in the Retort you may cast away.

139. The Volatile Salt of the Viper is a specific against the Venom of the
Viper, or of any other Poisonous Serpent or Beast: It is a certain cure for the
Plague or Pestilence, if curable; and is an Antidote in the Measles, Small Pox,
and other malign Fevers, or epidemick Distempers: for it resists all
Putrefaction, cures Agues caused thereby, chiefly Intermitting, and more
especially the Quartan, for which it is said to be a Specific. It dissolves
coagulated Blood, prevents inward Apostems, and cures the Pleurisy without
Blood-letting. It strongly fortifies nature, and enables her to perform all her
Functions as she ought to do. It chears the Mind, comforts the Heart, and
revives the Spirits Natural, Vital, and Animal: It causes the Nutriment to be
distributed to all parts of the Body, whereby it becomes a Specific in Curing
Consumptions. It opens all Obstructions in any part of the Body whatsoever, and
thereby cures the Scurvy and its Scorbutic train, causes a free Circulation of
the Blood and thoroughly purifies its Mass, casting away its soeculences through
the Pores of the Skin, thereby clearing it from Erysipela's, Scursss, Scabs,
Itch, Scaldheads, Tettars, Ring-worms, etc. It is the most powerful remedy in
Nature for the cure of the Leprosy, and Elephantiasis, whose signiture in part
the living Creature does bear. For it cuts, attenuates, opens, penetrates, and
expels through the Pores, all the Impurities which infest the whole Mass of
Blood, and habit of the Body; expelling them also in part by Urine, and
sometimes by Stool. It opens Obstructions of the Liver, Spleen, Mesentery and
Womb, dissolves cold and viscous phlegm; cures Lethargies, Apoplexies, Megrims,
Vertigo's, Convulsions, Palsies, and all other cold Diseases of the Head. It
strengthens the Stomach, and helps digestion; prevails in Faintings, Swoonings,
and Palpitations of the Heart, as also in Coughs, Colds, Asthma's, Inflammation
of the Lungs, and other Diseases of the Breast. A safer, speedier, better, or
more essectual Medicament, cannot be found again in the whole Art of Physic.
The Oil and Spirit have the same Virtues, but not altogether so powerful. Dose
of the Sait gr.vj ad xx, or more, and sometimes to ss: of the rectified Oil a
gut. iij ad x: of the Spirit a gut. xx ad xl.

III. Observations on Minerals.
140. The calcination of Gold by the Inquart. The name of Inquart is given to
this Immersive calcination of Gold, for that there is mixed therewith three
times as much in weight of tried Silver. Thus, Gold j: fine Silver iij: melt
them together in a Crucible: being melted, pour them by degrees in a large
Copper Vessel filled with Water to cause Granulation, so will they fall in
small grains to the bottom of the Vessel: Dry them well, put them into a
Mattress, and affuse thereon three times its weight of Aqua fortis, and keep the
Mattress over a moderate Sand-beat till the Silver is dissolved by degrees, and
the Gold precipitates to the bottom in a black Powder. Then decant the clear
Liquor by Inclination into an Earthen Pot full of Water: put upon the Gold
again a little more Aqua fortis to complete the dissolution of the little
remaining Silver, and decant again, as before, into the former Pot of Water:
The Calx of Gold remaining wash with Common Water till it is sweet; dry it, and
make it red hot in a Crucible, so will it be very high colored, and may be
either so kept, or melted in the same Crucible by adding a little Borax, and so
cast into an Ingot, which is then the most fine Gold: This is the highest and
best purification of Gold that can be, and the best separation of Gold from
Silver.

141. The dissolved Silver may be precipitated by putting into the Water a flat
Bar of Copper, for by this means the Aqua fortis quits the Silver and seizes
upon the Copper, so that the Silver precipitates to the bottom in a Calx or
Lime, which you may dry, and either keep it so, or melt it with a little Salt
of Tartar in a Crucible into an Ingot, which will be most fine Silver.

142. The purification of Gold by Antimony. Gold j: melt it in a Crucible, and
then add to it Antimony in powder iv: continue a strong fire till the matter
begins to sparkle, or sparks fly out, by which you may be sure that the
Antimony has consumed all the foreign matter or impurities of the Gold: then
take the Crucible out of the fire and cast the melted matter into an Iron
Cornute well heated and greased within, knocking the Cornute to make the Gold
descend to the bottom: being cold separate the Regulus from the Scoria: melt
the Regulus again in a Crucible over a strong fire, and cast in by little and
little three times its weight of Saltpeter, continue a good strong fire, that
the matter may remain in fusion, till all the Fumes are gone, and the Gold
appears clear and clean, then cast it again into the said Iron Cornute, well
heated and greased, knocking it as before, so will the Golden Regulus remain at
bottom perfectly pure.

143. In Our Pharmacopoeia lib. 3. cap. 1. sect. 4. we have shown how to make a
fine Calx of Gold by Amalgamation. If you take that subtle Calx well washed
with fair Water and dried, and mix it with three times its weight of flowers of
Sal Armoniack, well prepared and pulverized, then put them into a fit blind
Alembick, and sublime them together in a Sand-heat with a moderate fire, and
lastly, wash away the said Flowers with fair warm Water several times, till the
Calx of Gold is sweet, you will have the most subtle and well prepared Calx of
Gold (or rather flowers) that can be, and the most fit to make Tinctures with,
Aurum potabile, etc. See Sect. 17. of the place aforecited.

144. To refine Silver by the Coppel or Cupel, that is, with Lead. a Cupel made
of Ashes, or Bones or Horns, cover it and heat it gently with Coals, till it
grows red hot, cast into it four or five times as much Lead as you have Silver
to purify. Let the Lead melt, and fill the sides of the Coppel, which is
quickly done, then put in the Silver into the middle, and it will suddenly
melt: lay Wood round about the Coppel, and blow it, that the flame may
reverberate on the matter; the Impurities will mix with the Lead, and the
Silver remain pure in the midst of the Coppel, the Lead being filled with the
drossy parts, lying on the sides like Skum, which may be gathered up with a
spoon, and is called Litharge. According to the degree of Calcination it has
endured it becomes of diverse Colors; and accordingly is called Litharge of
Silver, or Litharge of Gold. The Cuppel being full of Pores, you must cast your
Silver into an Ingot, else it will suck it up. But if Gold is mixed with your
Silver, this Work will have no Operation upon that, and therefore you must have
recourse to the Inquart for separation.

145. They who have not all these conveniences for refining of Gold or Silver,
do no more but place a Crucible upon a Culot in the middle of a Hearth-place in
a Wind Furnace, and having lighted round about it a good Coal fire, they melt
in the red hot Crucible about jv. of Lead, and then cast upon it j of Silver,
which presently melts among the Lead: Then they keep a good fire about the
Crucible, till the Lead and all the other Imperfect Metals mixed with the
Silver, are exhaled into Smoke, or converted into Scum, on the top of the
Silver, which at the bottom of the Crucible will be solid, white and very pure.

146. Crystals of Luna. filings of Luna j: spirit of Niter iij: make a
dissolution over a gentle Sandheat: put this dissolution into a glass Cucurbit,
and in a Sand-heat (a Head and Receiver being luted to it) draw off of the
Spirit of Niter, then in a cool place, set the rest to Crystalize. The Liquor
not Crystaliz'd decant, and evaporate again to a thin Skin, and then set it to
Crystalize again: or you may totally evaporate it, and have a Calx or Lime of
Silver at bottom, which you may edulcorate by manifold ablutions in fair Water.
The Crystals being gathred and dried keep in a Glass close stopped. They are of
wonderful use in all inveterate Headachs, Megrims, Vertigo's, Epilepsies,
Apoplexies, Lethargies, Catarrhs, etc. Dose from half a grain to ij grains.
It Is an admirable Medicine.

147. The Silver Tree of the Philosophers, commonly called Diana's Tree.

filings of Silver i: spirit of Niter iij: make a dissolution: put this into a
Mattress, wherein is put fair Water xviij or xx: and Quicksilver ij: let the
Mattress be no bigger, but that these quantities may fill it up to the Neck; set
it upon a Wreath, or roll of Straw, or Rushes for forty days in some convenient
place; and in that space of time (for less will scarcely do) you will find a
Tree, grow, and spread forth its branches, with little Balls at their ends
representing its Fruit.

148. Tincture of Luna. the most subtle Calx or Lime of Luna, Volatile Salt of
Tartar, Volatile Salt of Urine, A. j: highest rectified S. V. xij: put them
into a Mattress, which cover with another lesser Mattress in stead of a blind
head: lute or close the joint with wet bladers: digest in a very gentle
Sand-head for 20 or 30 days, shaking the Vessel 2 or 3 times a day, till the
S.V. or Menstruum looks of a glorious celestial azure or blew Color: then
unlute the Vessels, and decant the Tincture into a strong glass, which keep
close stopped for use. This Tincture is only a dissolution of some particles,
which the Volatile sulphurous parts of the menstruum have volatilized. With the
remaining Calk of the Silver you may continually make new Tincture, till it is
all dissolved or wasted. This Tincture has all the Virtues of the Crystals of
Luna aforesaid, at Sect. 131. and may be given a gut. vj ad xvj. in Cinnamonw
ater or choice Canary, or black Cherry-wine.

149. The Calx of Silver (if you are not minded to keep it) you may thus
revive. Tartar, flints in powder A. j: good Niter iv: Charcole in powder ij:
mix these, and melt together, put them into a mortar warmed, and when cold, mix
thereof with the calx of Silver an equal quantity, put all into a crucible and
with a fire of Fusion, or a melting heat, you may reduce the said Lime into
Silver again.

150. From the said Lunar Calx, you may also extract a Tincture with oil of
Vitriol or Salt, dulcified with rectified S.V. which is no mean Medicine.

151. Salt of Steel. Oil of Vitriol or Sulphur, rectified S. V. A. viij: put
all into a new iron pan, smooth within, mingle them well; Cover it with a sheet
of Paper, and let it stand for fifteen or twenty days, or till a whitish gray
Salt stick to the sides and bottom of the Pan, and becomes dry; which separate,
gather and reduce into a fine Powder. It is an admirable thing to open all
Obstruction of the Viscera, and may be given from ss ad ss: in any Specific
Liquor. It is one of the best Preparations of Mars.

152. Aurum fulminans, has a force vastly stronger than Gun-pouder, viz. as 1.
to 200. for one scruple of this fulminant Gold put into a Silver Spoon, and
held over the fire, will give a louder bounce and do more mischief than two
hundre I scruples of the sinest and best Gun-pouder, which is above half a
pound. It Is doubtless a good Medicine taken inwardly, and by some thought to be
the best Medicine in the World, to expel, by Sweat, Mercury out of the Body,
having been given by unskilful Hands.

153. Tin may be sublimed thus: mix Calx of Tin with four times its weight of
Sal Armoniack, in very fine Powder: put them into an good Alludel upon a fit
Furnace, covered with three or four Pots one upon another, luting well the
Joins, covering the uppermost only with a little Head: kindle a gentle fire
under the Alludel, which increase by degrees, till the Alludel is red hot in
all the lower parts: then cast in at the hole ss of the Powder, cl^sing it
immediately, so will the Tin and Salt sublime in Vapors, and condense in
Flowers within the Sides of the Pots. After cast in ss. more of the Powder,
stop the hole again, till the Vapors ascending, condence into Flowers: and
thus continue the operation till all the Powder is spent; keeping all the while
a good fire under the Alludel, by which means all the Tin will be sublimed: if
you put equal parts of Tin and Salt, the greatest part of the Tin will remain
at bottom. The Sublimation ended, and the Vessels cold, gather the Flowers from
the Pots; and put them in an Earthen Vessel full of clear Water, let them rest
twenty four hour, then pour off the Water so will the Calx of Tin be at bottom
in form of a Magistery, which you may edulcorate by many Washings; dry it in
the Shade, and then keep it in a glass close stopped. It may be given alone, or
mixed with other things in Hysteric Cases. You may sublime it in like manner,
by subliming it with Sal Niter: And these Flowers may be Place here [v] [x] [y]
[z.] Beginning folio 289.
made into Salt of Tin, by dissolution in Spirit of Vinegar.

154. Artificial Bismuth, scarcely possible to be discerned from the true. pure
Tin Plates lbj, cut them into little pieces, lay a layer of cement and a layer
of Tin in a good Crucible, till the Crucible is nearly full: set it over a
naked fire in a proper Furnace with a moderate fire for an hour; then increase
it by degrees to the strongest heat for four hours: after fusion cast the
matter into a Mold heated and greased within, and make an Ingot: so will you
find the weight augmented four ounces above the weight of the Tin. The Cement
is thus made: Arsnick lbjss: White Tartar jv: Salt peter ij: beat the whole,
and mix them together. After the same manner is made Zink, of the same
Substances, in the same Proportion, and with the same Instruments, save there
Lead is used instead of Tin.

CHAP. XXVI. Of the POWERS of Medicaments, chiefly from Paracelsus.
1. WE have formerly (says 'Paracelsus) mentioned the Quintessence or POWER
which is in all things, now we are to consider what that is: The POWER or
POWERS therefore is a certain matter Corporeally extracted out of all the
things which Nature has produced; and also one of every thing which has Life
in its Self, and is separated from all Impurities and Mortality, is most
subtly mundified, and likewise separated from all the Elements, (though
brought forth in them.)

2. From hence it is evident, Place these sheets [v] [x] [y] [z.] after folio
320.
that the POTESTATES or POWERS of things are as if they were the Nature, Force,
and Virtue of those things, shut up and imprisoned in the said things
themselves, but are now free from their first habitations or dwelling places,
to wit, their extraneous Incorporation: these same POWERS are the Color, Lise,
and Propriety of things; they are a Spirit like the Spirit of Life, with this
disserence, that the Spirit of Life of a thing is permanent, but of a Man
Mortal; from whence may be understood that POTESTATES cannot be extracted from
the Flesh or Blood of a Man; and for this Reason, because the Spirit of Lise,
which also is the Spirit of Virtue, dies, and the Life exists in the Soul. By
the same reason also, all other Animals, because they lose the Spirit of Life,
are therefore wholly M^rtal, and afford no POTESTATES or POWERS, for the
POTESTATES are the Essential Spirits of the thing in all its Properties or
Principles of Sal, Sulphur, and Mercury, and therefore cannot be so well
Extracted out of things sensible, as out of things insensible.

3. But this is to be understood according to the Being and Nature of the
Vitality, for in Animals the Spirit while Living is the near or conjunct cause
of their Motion, Strength and Action; but in their Death, it is not so much as
the remote cause of any thing belonging to the Carcass; Paracelsus is therefore
to be understood in this very Sense, for in the other Case, a Dead Body has all
the three aforesaid Properties or Principles, and from which they may be all
separated, and the POTESTATES according to the kind, may from thence be
Extracted, as well as from all other Natural things, though it is true, the
said POWERS cannot be endued with that Motive, Active, and Sensible Spirit,
because the said Spirit is no part of their Essence: However you may have out
of all Dead Bodies the said POTESTATES pure and perfect according to the Nature
of their Essence, or being and form or matter: this is chiefly to be understood
of such Animal Bodies as are killed by force; as for those that dye of
themselves, or by means of any Disease: you can expect nothing but a weaker and
diseased POWER, for as much, as that the Creature would not dye of its Self,
unless all its natural POWERS were before hand either extinct, dissolved, or
weakened in a very great measure.

4. Bawm has in it self a Spirit of Life, the which is its Virtue, Power and
Medicine; and although it be separated from its Root, yet notwithstanding the
Life and Virtues are within it, for this Reason, that it is a sixed
Praedestination: Therefore its POWERS may be extracted from it, and be also
conserved with the Life thereof without Corruption as a thing Eternal according
to its Praedestination: Could we extract after this manner the Life of the
Heart, without Corrupting it, even as it is possible to do out of things
insensible, without doubt we might be capable of Living perpetually without the
knowledge or feeling of Death or Diseases; the which thing is impossible for us
to do, and therefore we must expect to dye.

5. Whereas therefore the POWERS are the Virtues of the Things; We must in the
first place tell you in what form the Virtue and Medicine is in things; and
that on this wise: Wine contains in it self a mighty great POWER, whereby it
has wonderful Operations; yet notwithstanding, there is not so much of the
Operation as of the Wine, as is evidently apparent. If Gall be cast into Water,
it makes it all bitter, although the Gall be not the hundred part of the Water:
so the smallest Portion of Sassron will ring a great quantity of Water; all
which does not therefore become Sassron; Thus in like sort it is to be
understood of their POWERS; their quantity is very little, and lodge as a Guest
in Woods, Herbs, Stones, and suchlike, the residue is a mear absolute Body of
Earth, the which we write of in the Book of the separation of the Elements.

6. Now we are not to dream, that the POTESTATES or POWERS called by
Paracelsus, a Quintessence, are a certain fifth Essence, above the Elements,
when as even it self is an Element. Likewise some or other may suppose that the
POWERS are a temperate Essence, viz. neither cold nor hot, nor m^ist, nor dry;
but truly it is not such, but of of the nature and quality of that from whence
it is drawn; and it is the POWERS, that gives the Simple the quality that it
hears: Nor is there any thing which consists of so equal a temperature, for by
it, it would be wholly alienated from the Elements. But all POTESTATES have a
nature according to the Elements; as for Example: The POWERS of Gold have a
Nature according to the Fire. The POWERS of Silver, according to the Water. The
POWERS of Saturn, according to the Earth. The POWERS of Mercury according to
the Air.

7. But the Reason why the POTESTATES cure all Diseases, is not because of
their Temperature, but because of their implanted Property, their great
cleanness and purity, whereby they do in a wonderful manner alter and change
the Body into cleaness, for even as a spot or film is took off from the Eye,
wherewith it was darkened before, even so do the POTESTATES mundify the Life in
Man.

8. But it follows not that all these ESSENCES or POWERS, must necessarily be
of one and the same Nature mutually; No. Nor all the fiery natured ESSENCES, or
POTESTATES of the self same Operation, by reason of their Complexion: as for
Example: Should any suppose, That the POTESTATES of Anacardiums, have the very
like, and self same operation as the POTEST ATES of Gold, because both of them
are of a fiery Nature; he would be extremely mistaken: because the
Predestination and Disposition causes the diversity of Virtues. For even as
every Animal contains in it self the spirit of Life, and yet for all that, they
have not all of them the very same like Virtues, because they all consist of
Flesh and Blood, but one differs from another in Taste, so in Virtue. Even so it
is with the POWERS of differing Medicines, the which do not receive their
Virtues from the Elements, simply understood, but from an Existing Propriety in
the same, according to our Discourse, in the Book of the Generation of things.

9. Hence it is, that some POTESTATES are Stiptick; some are Narcotick; other
some Attractive; others Hipnotick; others bitter, sweet, benumming; and others
are Renovaters of the Body into Youthfulness; others conserve it in Health,
purge, bind it, etc. the Virtues of which POTESTATES are innumerable, nor can
they be reckoned up here, but yet a Physician should know them very well.

10. When therefore the POTESTATES are separated from the Non-PoTESTATES as the
Soul from its Body, and that it be taken inwardly into the Body, what Infirmity
is able to resist so noble, pure and potent a Nature? Or, to take away the Life
from our Body, Death excepted, viz. the praedestinated time which separates the
Body and Soul, as we teach in Our Book of Life and Death. We are also to
consider in this place, that every Disease requires its peculiar POTESTATES;
although we teach some that are fit for all Diseases. Bat by what reason that
comes to pass, shall be taught in its proper place.

11. Moreover we testify, that the POWERS of Gold are as to their quantity,
exceeding small, and the residue is a Leprous Body, in which there is remaining
neither sweetness nor sowrness, nor any Virtue or POWER, besides the mixion of
the four Elements. And this Secret we ought not to be ignorant of in the least,
viz. that the Elements themselves cannot without the POWER resist any Disease,
but are only thus much, and no more than thus; to wit, to heat or to cool,
without any kind of Virtue. As, put case, the Disease be hot, it is driven out
by cold; but not by that frigidity which is void of cold Virtues; as Water and
Snow, the which two though suffitiently cold, yet are void of POTESTATES by
which the Disease ought to be expelled.

12. On this Account, the Body of Gold is of it self invalid; but its POTEST
ATES only existing in that Body, and in its Elements, yields those Virtues
therein hidden. So likewise it is in all other things, it is their POTESTATES
only which Cure, heal, and tinge the whole Body, as Salt does excellently
season any food. The POWERS therefore are they which give Color, be it what
ever it will, even the most glorious; also Virtue, by which it is operative.
And if Gold be spoiled of its color, it does likewise loose its POTESTATES. The
same is to be understood of other Metals, that when their Colors are removed
from them, they are then robed of their POWERS or natural Virtues.

13. The like is in Stones and Gems: As the POTESTATES of Coral are a certain
fatness with a redness, but the Body is white. The POTESTATES of the Emerald is
a green juice, and the Body of it is also white. The same is to be supposed of
all the rest of the Stones, viz. that they loose their Nature, Essence, and
Properties, together with their Colors, as we teach peculiarly in their
Extractions.

14. In like manner of Flesh and of Blood, from which the first POTESTATES
cannot be extracted, for the reasons abovementioned; but a second POTESTAS (in
the similitude of the first) we may extract therefrom; after this manner a
piece of Flesh is as yet furnished with its whole Nature and Virtues, and
therefore there is a Life in it, which is an Essential and Centeralone; which
although it be not the true Life, is nevertheless a preserved Life, and that so
long until it putrefies. See sect. 3. above.

15. And therefore this difference is to be noted, whereby dried Herbs, and
such like, are to be accounted of, as was spoken of Flesh. For that green
Spirit which is their Life, is perished from them; thus it is with Blood and
dried Herbs. Which indeed although they want their first Life, yet do they
yield a POTESTAS endued with manifold Virtues. But Metals and Stones have in
them a perpetual Life and Essence, nor do they dye. But as long as they are
Metals or Stones, so long also does their Life endure. Therefore also do they
exhibit perfect POTESTATES, which may in like manner be extracted from them.

16. We are also to see by what way the POTESTAS or POWER, is to be extracted.
Verily there may be many ways. Some are made by addition of their own
Inflamable spirit, made by fermentation: others by Balsamites: some by the
separation of the Elements: and by many more several ways, which we shall not
count here particularly.

17. But what way soever they are done; the POTESTAS must not be extracted by
the addition or mixion of things inconvenient and unsuitable with it; but the
Elements of the POTESTAS is to be extracted alone, from the separated Body; and
likewise by such a separated Body as is Extracted; there are many ways by which
the POTESTAS may be extracted, viz. by Sublimation, Calcination, by Strong
Waters, by Corrosives, by sweet things, by sour things, etc. and it may be done
any kind of way.

18. But this also is to be noted: that every thing which has been admixed to
the matter, by reason of the necessity of Extraction of the POWERS, that same
thing is to be extracted again therefrom, that so the POWERS may remain alone,
without being poluted, or permixed without any other thing. For it cannot
possibly be, that the POTESTATES can be extracted from Metals, and especially
from Gold (for that cannot be over come by it self) without using some fit
Corrofive or dissolvent, that may again afterward be separated therefrom. So
Salt, which was Water, is again extracted from the Water, so that this Water is
void of Salt.

19. But now this is to be considered, that it is not every corrosive or
dissolvent, that is fit for this Work, because they cannot all of them be
separated: for if Vitriol or Alum be permixt with Water, neither of them can be
separated from it afterward, without detriment or corruption, but they leave
behind them a sharp residence; and that for this Reason, because that they are
both Watery, and there is made a Concurrency, or Meeting of two likes; the
which ought not so to be in this place.

20. Therefore diligent heed is to be used, that you take not a Watery Body to
a Watery, nor an Oily Body to an Oily, or a Resinous to a Resinous Body; but
verily the contrary ought to separate the POTESTAS, and to extract it. Water
extracts the POTESTAS of Oleaginous Bodies, (as is mentioned of the Metals) and
Oleaginous things the POWERS of Watery Bodies, a^ we may learn in the
POTESTATES of Herbs.

21. Therefore after the separation and extraction of the POWERS, the
corrosives or dissolvents are to be again separated which will easily be done,
for Oil and Water are easily separated; but Oil from Oil not so. Nor can Water
be separated from Water; the which thing being left, may bring to the
POTESTATES a very great loss: for the POTESTAS must be clear and undefiled, and
must be gathred without the permixion of any thing whatsoever, that it may have
a uniform substance, whereby it may ^e able to penetrate the whole Body.

22. The subtility and Virtues of these POTESTATES or POWERS, cannot be
fundamentany found out, no more than their Original from whence they first
proceeded can be known. For they have many degrees. The POWERS of one thing are
against Fevers, as are those of Opiates. The POWERS of another thing are
against the Hyposarcha or Dropsy, as the Essence of Tartar. The POWERS of
another thing against the Apoplexy, as th^se of Gold: The POWERS of another
against the Ep^^^psy, as those of Vitriol. The number hereof are even infinite
and unsearchable by Experience.

23. It Is worthy therefore the highest consideration and diligence, that to
every Disease, its true Enemy or Remedy may be assigned: for so Nature will
give an incredible assistance, the which we will make a better declaration of,
in what follows.

24. We cannot speak of the Degrees of POTESTATES in such a manner as in the
assignment of Degrees to simple things in Medicines; the reason is this,
because there can be no comparison of the Degrees of POWERS, to the Degrees of
Simples, nor indeed may be: but when they are exalted, the Excellency and
Virtue of One is found to be greater than that of another, and not the
Complexion. Nor is it to be conceived, that the POWERS of Anthos, are hotter
than the POWERS of Lavender: Or the POWERS of Venus, dryer than those of Luna:
but the Degree of any thing is to be discerned by the great and more excellent
Virtues, that it has, after the following manner.

25. The POTESTATES of Antimony cure the Leprosy: the POTESTATES of Coral cure
the Spasm and Torsions, or Gripings. But now to know which of these is the
higher and better graduated, there can be no other Judgment of it than this,
viz. That the POWERS of Antimony are higher, and more excellent, and that for
this Reason, because the Leprosy is a more grievious Disease than the Cholick
is with all its Appurtenances: And therefore answerable to the propriety that
each have against diverse Diseases, are their degres to be considered.

26. Yea also in one and the very same Disease; for so in the Leprosy, one
Essence or POWER is more efficacious than another. The POWers of Juniper expel
it: so also the POWERS of Ambergrise, of Antimony and of Gold. Now although all
these POWESTATES will cure the Lepr^sy, yet notwithstanding they do it
differently; nor do they consist (as to the Cure thereof) in one and the same
degree.

27. For the Essence or Powers of Juniper, expells this Disease by a most high
repurgation and cleansing, which it brings into the Blood, and consumes the
Venom so that it is not so perceptible: and therefore to be accounted in the
first degree of that Cure. The POWERS of Ambergrise takes away the Venom also:
and does more, for it mundifies the Lungs, Heart, and Members subject to the
Leprosy: and therefore the second Degree is to be attributed thereto.

28. The Essence or POWERS of Antimony do yet go farther than the two aforesaid
Virtues; they mundify the skin, and accuate and renew the whole Body after a
wonderful Manner, and therefore do obtain the third degree. But the POWERS of
Sol do even alone accomplish all those operations, and radically take away all
the Symptoms of the Leprosy, and so renews the Body, even as Honey and Wax are
purged from their Comb, and therefore it posseth the 4th degree.

29. By this kind of Way are the Degrees of POTESTATES to be known and
distinguished one from another; that is, which of them is more high, or more
excellent. Besides Simples are to be known by their properties; for as is their
property in the simple form, such also are their POWERS; not sluggisher, but
muchmore powerful and excellent.

30. Moreover, We must likewise know the Disserences of POTESTATES: for some of
them do very much coincide or serve for the Liver, to resist all its diseases,
some for the Head; others for the Reins; some for the Lungs; others for the
Spleen, and such like. Likewise some do opperate only on the Blood; others on
the Phlegm only; some upon Melancholy only; others upon Choler; and others upon
all the Humors.

31. Again some POTESTATES, have their Operations in the Humors only; some in
the Spirit of Life; some in the Nutritive Spirit; some in the Bones; othersome
in the Flesh; some in the Marrow; othersome in the Gristles; and some in the
Arteries. Also there are some that opperate against some Diseases only, and
against none else, as the Palsy, Epilepsy, Convulsions, Fluxes, the Dropsy,
etc. Some also are found to be Narcoticks, others Anodyne; some Somniferous,
others Watchful; others also Attractive, Purgative, Munidificative,
Incarnative, Comfortative, Regenerative, Stupefactive, etc.

32. Furthermore, there are some to be found that Renovate and Restore; that
is, such as transmute the Body, Blood and Flesh. Othersome for the Conservation
of the Diuturnity; or prolongation of Life. Some for the preservation and
retaining of Youthfulness; some of them work by Transmutation; and some by
Enkindling or stirring up. Moreover, this is to be understood, That some
POTESTATES have a Specifical Form, others an Appropriated form; some an
Influential; others a Natural form.

33. Briefly, there are many more Virtues that they are endued withal, which
we are not able to Describe; and their Operations in Medicine, are exceeding
admirable and unsearchable, and that variously. For some POTESTATES will make a
man of an hundred years old like to one of but twenty years of Age; and that by
their own Virtues and Power. And now what man is able to search out the
original of so great a Mystery? Or to sind out from whence the first matters do
naturally spring? It is at the pleasure of the most Supreme Creator, either to
make them so, or to forbear.

24. Who shall instruct us to know what the Virtues of the POWERS of Antimony
are, by which the old Hair is cast off, and new springs up in its room?
likewise why the POWERS of Bawm roots out the Teeth, and eradicates the Nails
of the Hands and Feet, and causes new ones to grow in their places? Or how the
POWERS of Robis rubs and scours off the Sin, and renews it? How the POWERS of
Celandine change the Body, renewing it into good and better; just so as fresh
colors renew a Picture? There are far more properties than these, which we omit
here, reserving them to be declared in another place.

35. And now at last, how can it be possible, that we can relinquish and
neglect this noble Philosophy and Medicine, seeing that Nature affords unto us
such wonderful Experiments, both in and from them? yea such as the other
faculties are wholly destitute of; for that they are placed in a mere
cavilation.

36. Why should not this strange Operation be very pleasing unto us, viz. That
the POWERS of the Carline Thistle take away the forces or strength of one man,
and bestows them upon another that uses them? likewise that the POTESTATES of
Gold, inverts or turns as it were, the whole Leprous body inside outward, and
so washes it as an Intestine or Entrails are washed at the Slaughter house; and
do likewise remove the scabby Skin, and make a new one; loosening the Orgains
of the Voice, and taking away the whole Leprous Complexion, producing such a
new or renovated one, as if he newly came forth from his Mothers Womb.

37. Now therefore, We will apply our mind to the making of these POTESTATES,
and direct you the way of their Extraction or Composition. To this purpose we
will endeavor to declare them in a just and due order, together with their
Appurtenaces; to wit, one way for Metalls; another for Marcasites; another for
Salts; another for Stones and Gems; another for Burning things; another for
Growing things; another for Spices; and another for Comestible and potable
things.

38. But yet you are to take notice, in the Practick part of making POTESTATES
or POWERS, That the Theory, and a good knowledge of Natural things is
requisite: yet notwithstanding Theorically of the propertys of things to
natural Diseases: Nor are we to be ignorant of the difference between
POTESTATES and Aurum Potabile, Arcanies, Magisteries, and others of that kind,
thus: POTESTATES cannot be again reduced into their Bodies; but Aurum Potabile
may be again transmuted very well, into its Metalick Body: and therefore the
Virtues that are in POTESTATES, are far more noble than in other things.

39. But now in Our thus Discoursing of POTESTATES, the difference in respect
of the one and the other is to be known, and also what that difference is. And
although we have sufficiently Explained it before, yet the Practick allures and
calls us some other way; by which said way, the condition and nature of the
said POWERS comes to be found out and known.

40. For although all do not appear in the form of POWERS, nor are made after
the same manner, nor consists of one Element alone, as POTESTATES ought to do;
yet never theless, it is to be understood, that as to the POWERS of those
things, they are more than so, as to be called POTESTATES; and are rather to be
styled a certain Arcanum and Mystery, concerning which, more should be written
than we have here said; but whereas we have declared the same in other Books,
we shall pass it over in this place.

41. The number of the Arcana's and Mysterys of this Art is infinite and
unsearchable, and many are the ways thereof, that we meet withal, and which
require the attentive heed of a man's quickest ingenuity; but yet among all this
number of Arcana's, we will here rehearse four. The first of these Secrets is
Mercurius Vitae: the second is the Prima Materia: the third is the Philosophers
Stone: the fourth is the Tincture.

42. And although those Arcana's are, as to their revealment, rather Angelical
than Humane, yet nevertheless we will not greatly fear or doubt of them, but
will rather endeavor to search out the ways of Nature; and even all that which
has proceeded from Nature, may in my Opinion be also naturally understood.

43. We do therefore profess concerning Mercurius Vitae, That it is not a
POTESTAS, but an Arcanum; because there are in it many Virtues and Powers which
preserve, restore, and regenerate, as we write in the Book of Arcana's. So
likewise the Prima Materia does not only act upon living Bodies, but also on
dead, after the same manner, more than can be imagined to be done naturally.
The Philosophers Stone in like manner shows its efficacy, the which tinging the
Body, does cure it of all Diseases, even as each of the Metals are cleansed
from their Impurities. Lastly, the Tincture in the same manner, does as well
transmute the Disease into Health, as it does Luna into Sol.

44. The general way of making POTESTATES. I will not in the least be redious;
but briefly disclose the Practick. Reduce the matter (prepared according to the
process, in the Book of the Death of things) into a liquid substance with AF.
and separate the three imperfect Elements, by very many Cohobations and
Putrefactions; then the sixth Element, of what kind soever it be, remains
rightly in the bottom. Now abstract the Volatile, (which comes over in the
separation of the Elements) from the fixed oftentimes, that so the POWERS which
partly ascended with the phlegm, may be again co-united. Take then the fixed
Element, which remained after the separation of the three imperfect Elements
(what kind soever it be of) and dissolve it in its appropiated water, each
according to its nature; keep it in the greatest putrefaction, distill it by
Cohobation, the rest per descensum. Putrify it yet a little more, distill and
conjoyn all, and distill it in B.M. even to an oyliness, then corrupt or break
it with the subtle S.V. by boiling; then the impure will settle to the bottom,
and the pure will swim at top, separate it by a Tritorium or separating glass,
and that it may therewithal loose the nature of the A.F. pour on a greater
quantity of the S.V. the which abstract often, till the POTESTATES become
sweet: lastly wash it off with common cold water, and keep the POWERS for use.

45. After the like manner you are to conceive of Marchasites, Stones, Resins,
Herbs, Flesh, Excrements, and fixed things, viz. That the three imperfect
Elements be separated, and that the fixed Element be farther proceeded with, as
in the former section, and as we shall hereafter more particularly declare

46. Now whereas I have thus briefly taught the general way of making the
POWERS of things, and the so short way of their Extraction, there is no cause
for any to wonder, at the hasty running of my Hand or Pen, because the way and
method is well and sufficiently delivered. Nor are these POTESTATES so
succinctly or briefly written of by us, but that the work and labor necessary
thereunto, is most evidently Demonstrated: It Is to be considered that Exercise
and use teach all things.

47. But as to the wonderful Virtues and Faculties of POTESTATES thus
Extracted, or as we shall hereafter teach, we have already spoken, and shall
more abundantly in some other parts of this Work. And although that many Men
before us, have in various Instructions and Documents written some great matters
of Quintessences; nevertheless, we do not account of what they have Written, as
for a Quintessence, POTESTAS or POWER; the cause of which we sufficiently
declare.

48. By their Writings it is apparent, that Veraigrise was accounted by them to
be the Quintessence or POWER of Venus; which is not so; but the Crocus of
Venus, is the Quintessence or POTESTAS thereof, which is thus to by understood.
Flos Aeris, or the Power of Brass, is a transmutation with, and partaking with
the substance, is gross and subtle together, and is extracted out of the whole
Venerean complexion; or body and spirituous parts of Venus, and therefore
cannot be a POTESTAS or Quintessence, as they call it. But the Crocus of Venus,
(made as we have taught) is the true Quintessence or POWER: for it is a Potable
thing and very subtle, separated from the Body without corrosion or permixion;
yea, it is more than I am willing to write down here.

49. So likewise the Rust of Mars, as also its solid Crocus, has hitherto among
them been accounted for a Quintessence or POTESTAS, but it is not so; for the
Crocus of Mars is the Oil of Mars, yea and more than the Oil, the Spirit and
the Salt of Mars, concentrated in one uniform Body. Concerning these things, We
set down more of them about Transmutation, in our Philosophy.

50. POTESTATES therefore, are thus to be understood, viz. That they are
nothing else but a separation of VIRTUES from the BODY, wherein the whole
Medicinal Virtue and Essence is. This is a very short, but most excellent and
admirable definition of this Great Man, the most profound PARACELSUS. But as
for the Flos AEris and Flos Martis, and many more such like, to wit, what they
are, shall be delivered in the place of Magisteries.

51. The like judgment must be had of Vegetables as of Metals; and although we
have set down very many and noble Virtues of POTESTATES, yet nevertheless we
have recited but the smallest part of their Virtues, Properties and Qualities:
but we have chiefly declared thus much, that these things may be somewhat
understood, but as to the Quality and Quantity of all their Virtues, and
wherein they do excel, is not done in the least by us.

52. Hence also is manifest the Cause, why Man was Created, and all things in
the Earth made subject unto him; likewise, why nothing, be it good or bad,
proceeds forth without a Cause, the which is more clearly declared in the
Book of the Nature of things. For that Fundamental and Basis brings with it a
Faith strongly bent upon the Creator, and an hope of his Love toward us, as of
a loving Father to his Children: and therefore we must not snatch at every
shaddowy and vain Faith, but ought to behold God only and Nature, and the Art
of Nature. Wherefore good reason have we to invoke him only in this life and
for ever; and believe that only which we see so to be, and neither receive nor
approve of any thing that does not agree with Nature, or is besides her way.
This is wise Council of the Divine PARACELSUS.

The special Extraction of POTESTATES out of all things whatsoever, according
to Paracelsus.
53. The Extraction of the POWERS of Metals.

The seven Metals have one and the same Prooess, and it is this: Let the Motal
be dissolved into Water, then afterward must this solution be distilled by a
B. and be asstracted or drawn off, and putrisfied so long until it be reduced
into an Oil, which must be distilled out of small glass Cucurbits, by an
Alembick, and one part of the Metal will remain in the bottom, the which let be
again reduced into an Oil, as before, and be distilled so long, until all the
Metal shally ascend. Then let it be again putrified for a Month, and at length
be again distilled with a gentle fire, and the Vapors will ascend first, and
fall into the Receiver, the which Vapors remove: then there will ascend two
obscure colors, one White, the other answerable to the nature and condition of
the Metal, and when they shall be wholly come over, they become separated in
the Receiver: so that the POTESTATES remain in the bottom, and the white color
of the Body swims on top: separate those two by a separating Glass, and put the
POTESTATES into another Glass, and put upon it the best rectified S.V. which
let remain so long therewith, until the S.V. be plainly acuated, then let it be
separated from the POTESTATES, and more fresh be again poured on: this do
often, till you perceive no more acuity or sharpness: at last pour on Water
twice distilled, wherewith let it be washed, and brought unto its sweetness, so
keep it in a Glass close stopped for use. Thus have you the POWERS of Metals.

54. As for the white color of the Body, if you reduce it, you shall have
therefrom a white maleable and metallic Body, the which cannot be known, as
under what species or kind it is contained. Many other ways are to be sound for
the Extraction of these POWERS, which we shall be silent in, because we account
them not for true Extraction of that kind, but only as Transmutations, in which
there is no extraction made or used.

55. Now this is to be understood, That Metalls are to be divided into two
parts, viz. into their POTESTATES, and into their BODY, both which are liquid
and Potable, but will not be permixed together. But the impure body, turns
forth the POTESTAS to its superficies, even as the Colastrum, or Cream is
separated from the Milk.

56. By this way are made two fatnesses or viscous liquors out of Metalls; the
which liquors are to be separated. As for the fathess of the BODY, it is always
white, even of all the Metals: but their POTESTATES is colored, even as we have
explained it before, concerning the seven Metals; and they likewise have the
same Process with the former.

57. The Extraction of the POWERS of Marchasites.

Take a Marchasite ground most exceeding small lbj: of corroding or eating
Water lbij: being permixt together in a Pelican, let them remain in digestion,
two or three Months, and they will be reduced into a Liquor: Distill this Liquor
by the Fire wholly, and it will come over in an Oil, the which thou shall
putrify together in Horse dung for a Month; then distill it, as you did the
Metals, and there will likewise two colors ascend, as did from the Metals; one
color white, the other the true color of the POTESTAS: leave the white, except
it be of Bismuth, or a white Marchasite, and then you shall know them from each
other by the thickness. Take the undermost, and reduce it to its sweetness, as
was before spoken of the Metals: so have thou the POWERS of Marchasites in all
purity.

58. Where we speak of the corroding or eating Water, understand Acetum, mixed
with Spirit of Wine, and such a Spirit as being often abstracted from the
Spirit of Sal-Niter, becoms an Acetum. The fixed Element of Marchasites are to
be dissolved, therein to be putrified and elevated by an Alembick, and then at
length to be corrupted or broken with the Spirit of Wine, that the Impure may
fall to the bottom, and separate it self from the Pure.

59. There are also various ways to be found, as to the Extraction of the
POWERS of Marchasites, but yet we cannot in the least account them for true
POTESTATES. And although they be of greater Virtues than the POTESTATES, as we
teach of Arcana's, Magisteries and Elixirs: yet notwithstanding the way and
manner that we here use, in Extracting the POWERS of all Metaline Marchasites,
is like to the true extraction of the Metals.

60. And whereas we said before, that the POTESTAS is the most supreme Virtue
of things; and do yet for all that aver the contrary in Arcana's, viz. that
they are greater than POTESTATES are; the reason is this, because all Arcana's
contain in them the said POTESTATES, and are exalted farther to such an acuity
and subtilty, that they do receive thereby a far greater Virtue than the POWERS
have.

61. The Extraction of the POWERS of Salts.

Take Salts, the which you must calcine excellently well: but if they be
Volatile salts, burn them; afterward let them be resolved into a Tenuity or
thinness, and be distilled into a Water. Put this Water into Putrefaction for a
Month, and distill it by a Balneo, and there will ascend a sweet Water, which
throw away. That which will not ascend, set again in digestion for another
Month, and distill it as before; and thus do so often till there be no more
sweetness perceived: for by this way have thou now the POWERS of salt in the
bottom; from lbj of burnt or calcined salt, thou will scarcely have ij.

62. Or thus. Cohobate them with their own proper Liquor or Water, oftentimes
putrefy them with Phlegm; and abstract the Body therefrom in the manner of
Phlegm, even to the fixed Spirit. This then dissolve in Water, or in their own
proper Water; and (in the heat) separate the pure from the impure with Spirit
of Wine.

63. By either of these ways (which disser not much) the POTESTATES of all
Salts are prepared, as out of Common-salt, Baysalt, sal Niter, Alum, Vitriol,
sal Veneris, sal Antimonij, etc. Half an ounce of this Salt thus extracted
(suppose from common salt) will season more Meat or Broth, than half a pound of
the Salt it self: for here the POTESTATES are only present, and the BODY is
abstracted therefrom by a a liquid Solution:

64. But the POTESTATES of Alum and Vitriol, are much better extracted by this
following Direction. Calcine them, but not to Fusion, as you do other Salts:
after calcination burn them, and resolve them according to the rule of
Practice. After they be resolved, pour on again the Waters that proceeded from
them, and proceed on, according to the process given of Salts; for much of the
Essence ascends with the moisture, the which does again thus reside at the
bottom in the Composition and Putrefaction, and so come together into one.

65. The Extraction of the POTESTATES of Stones, Gems, and Pearls.

Take which of them you please, beat them into pretty big pieces, not into a
Powder, and put them in a glass, and put thereto the Acetum of the Root, or
Radicated Vinegar, so much as to overtop the matter the breadth of four or five
Inches: let them be digested gested into a Horse Belly for a whole Month, which
being done, the whole matter will appear liquid; the which thou shall extract
with other radicated Vinegar, and shake and mix them well together; so the
Vinegar receives into it self the color of the Stone. The colored Vinegar must
be poured out into another glass: on the Magma remaining put more Ranficated
Vinegar as before, this do so often as there comes off any color. Now in this
color are the POTESTATES contained, the residne is the Corporality. T^^
therefore the colored or tinged Vinegars, and boil them very gently, even to
dryness; then wash it often with distilled water, until it be made sweet, as
abovesaid. This powder dissolve upon a Marble, so shall thou have the
POTESTATES of Gems and Pearls. But this is to be noted in the Colors of Pearls,
that they are resolved into the color of thick Milk, and the body of them is
sandy and viscous, by which the one may be known from the other. The like also
is it with Crystal, its POTESTAS appears at top, a certain viscous Body
remaining.

66. Where we speak of Radicated Vinegar, understand us thus: to wit, that you
have a sharp Acetum corrected with Tilos or Bricks, and oftentimes abstracted
from the Tartarised Matrix of Acetum. Your Gems, are first to be calcined-by
sulphur, then dissolve them therein, and putrefy them, and then separate the
pure from the impure, by breaking them with spirit of Wine.

67. The former process serves for stones, Gems, and Pearls, and is the most
excellent of all, as to the Operation thereof, very subtle and industrious: But
very little is the quantity of the POTESTATES which is to be had out of Gems;
and by how much the more transparent and purer the Gem is, by so much the less
is its POTESTAS. It Is searce worth while to extract it from gross, great and
base Stones, for they have but little Virtue in them, and therefore have but a
small quantity of POWERS, to be drawn from them.

68. The Extraction of the POTESTATES of burning things.

Take the Body (whether it contains Oil, Rosin, Pitch, or Turpentine, Fir-wood,
Juniper-wood, Cypress or Ceder-wood etc. or whether it be seeds, fruits, or
such like) cut it exceeding small, and put it in a glazed Pot, fill it up, and
cl^se it firmly with Lutum Sapientiae, that so it breath not out: burn it in a
circulary fire for twenty four hours, so as to abide in an equal heat, and the
pot to be glowing like the Coals: then take it out of the fire; and putrefy it
in Dung for a month, after distill as much as will ascend: let this be put in a
Horse-Belly, distill off all the moisture therefrom, and then let it be set
again to putrify, until there come out no more moisture: then at last the
POTESTATES of that which you have received, and at first took in the Receiver,
remains in the bottom.

69. Now here is to be noted, that there are many other ways and kinds of
extracting the POWERS of the aforenamed things, by which they may be drawn very
odoriferous, subtle, and clear: but those ways are not Extractions of the
POTESTATES, but certain Magisteries of those same things, by which some part of
the POTESTAS does in the permixion together, ascend upwards.

70. But the Essence of Woods (which is, what is here, and sect. 68. aforegoing
intended) is a certain Fatness or Resin, and thick substance; and therefore not
to be extracted in the form of a Magistery; for this Reason; The Essence or
POTESTATES of the Turpentine-tree heals Wounds; but if it be extracted after
the manner of Magisteries, it does not cure them. The reason is, because the
Magistery has not in it the Basis and Foundation of the POWERS: and they are
thus distinguished: Magisteries only concern and respect the Complexions and
four Elements, and have the POWERS spirituously: POTESTATES do not concern
themselves with those things, and have or possess the POWERS materially.

71. The Extraction of POTESTATES out of growing things, as Herbs, etc.

Take growing things, bruise them exceeding will, put them into some fit
Vessel, the which set in a It: se-belly for a Mouth; then distill it by B. put
them again into Horseedung for eight days, and let them again be distilled by
B. M. so the POTESTATES will ascend by the Alembick, but the BODY will abide in
the bottom: If there should ought of the POWERS remain yet behind in the
faeces; you must farther putrify, and proceed as before: Then take this
distilled Water, and put it again to this growing BODY, so let them be digested
together in a Pelican for six days: then the color will be thick, the which
abstract by B. M. and that Body will go away, and be severed; the POWERS
remaining in the bottom: separate this (by a Retorsive process, or pressing)
from the faeces; by this means thou shall have a Medicine perfect in Odor,
Juciness, Taste and Virtue, and of a thick consistency.

72. The Essence is easily perfected out of Herbs Roots, Fruits, etc. so that
you dissolve the imperfect Elements by the highest, secret putrefaction of the
highest heat. Then shall thou putrify them in Dung, and drive out per
descensum, all that is able to go out, and from thence abstract by a
distillation in a B. M. all the hurtful imperfect Body of the moisture: then
will the praedistinated Element remain in the bottom: this must now be
separated from the superfluous Impurity, by corrupting or breaking it with its
own inflamable spirit, or with S.V. the which draw off, and thou shall have the
POTESTATES pure and perfect.

73. As to the Extraction of these Essences, there are various ways found out,
by the addition of other things: but they ought to be extracted without the
mixture of any thing, and so as to retain their Color, Odor, and Taste; and that
they may be increased in them and not diminshed.

74. The Extraction of the POTESTATES of Spices and Persumes.

Take Oil of Almonds with which mix an Aromatical Body, as Spices, Musk,
Ambergrise, Civet, Camphir, (and such like) let them be digested together in a
Glass in the Sun, their proper time, until they are reduced into a paste or
pap: afterward, let them be pressed out from their faces; so is the Body
separated from the POTESTATES, which are now only mixed with Oil, and are to be
separated therefrom after this manner: Take rectified spirit of Wine, wherewith
mix the afore-impregnated Oil: put them in digestion for six days, afterward
let them be distilled by Ashes, and there will ascend the spirit of Wine, and
therewith the POWERS of the Aromaticks, the Oil remaining in the bottom without
any smell of the spice or persume. Lastly, let this Wine be distilled by B.M.
and the POTESTATES will abide in the bottom in the form of Oil, separated from
all mixtures.

75. The POWERS being extracted out of Ambergrise, Musk, Civet, their Bodies or
Faeces do stink afterward, so that they are nothing worth, either in Smell,
Taste or Nature: and the like is to be understood of the rest of that kind.
Moreover it appears that the POWERS of Aromaticks are first separated by the
help of a Medium; and afterward separated from that Medium, by the help of
another Medium, which will afterward separate it self from the POTESTATES by
the help of heat only.

76. The Extraction of POTESTATES of Comestible things.

Take a Comestible thing, (as flesh of Fowls, Beasts, Fishes, etc. Bread, etc.)
out it into pieces, and put it into a Vessel, or great stone-Jug, which stop
and lute very well; let it boil for three days: then strain out that which
shall be in the Jugg, and distill it by a B. M. so there will first of all
Ascend a certain Wateriness, the which when it shall be all come over, the
POTESTATES will be left at the bottom.

77. This is the highest Nutriment beyond all that we can declare or set down;
and in respect of nourishing, it is like, or at leastwise it has the qualities
and properties of the most pure and substantial POWERS.

78. Now the POTESTATES of Comestible things, are to be in no wise understood,
than in a like form, with that wherewith we are fed; with Flesh; for the POWERS
of Comestible things, as are the best nourishment: And although no Prime
POTESTATES can be drawn from Flesh, as aforesaid, yet we are able to extract
therefrom, as from its own being or Essentiality, a Secondary POWER, as is even
now above declared.

79. The Extraction of POTESTATES out of Potable things.

Take any Potable thing, shut it up in a Pelican, as it is, with its whole
substance, and digest it for a Month in Horse-dung; (but it will be better to
leave it so for a year or more;) and you will find in the Pelican a certain
digested matter: separate this same by B. M. afterward by Ashes: and lastly by
Fire. By this means you will have three POTESTATES, which are in all Potable
things. Put these three Liquors thus extracted, each into its proper Vessel:
the two last, farther digest, then distill in B. M. so will you have more of the
first POTESTATES to ascend, which you must mix with the said first: this do so
often till no more of the first will arise, so will there be a good separation.

80. But the POWERS of Potable things may be extracted many and sundry other
ways; but this (here taught) is, (says PARACELSVS) the true Process, by him
accounted as the chiefest, fittest, and most profitable for this Work.

CHAP. XXVII. An Idea of the Process of the universal Medicine of Paracelsus.
1. TAke of the best Philosophic water, which separate from its feces: the
best is brought from the Oriental parts of the World, and is very strong and
pure: in one pound, you will not have above two, three, or four ounces of feces
or setlings at most.

2. This Philosophic water taken from its own fountain (being first Agitated)
you shall put into a Glass Retort with a Receiver: then you shall filter or
strain the philosophickwater through a philosophic strainer. If you cannot get
this water from the Oriental fountains or Wells; take that from the Occidental
which is the best next, and filter or strain it through a philosophic strainer
several times. If you cannot get the Occidental, take the strongest and purest
you can get, whose goodness you may try by evaporating a little of it away in a
sliver spoon: if the water flys away, leaving a yellow, or white salt at
bottom, it will serve; but if it leaves a black or green salt, it is naught for
this Work.

3. Take this philosophic water (which is for Our purpose) precipitate it ten
or twelve times with salt Armoniack, and then filter or strain it as many times
through a philosophic strainer, that it may be pure and clear, and be freed
from all mixtures of foulness. The Oriental and Occidental Waters are pure of
themselves, and need not to be precepitated.

4. First, you are to divide the salt from the spirit of the philosophick-water
without any Corrosive: and that the said water be spirituous and living, and
clear as Rock-Crystal. This salt of the philosophic water, Parace^sus calls
Praecipiolum, and says, That it must be separated Dead from its own Fountain,
and that the philosophic water, shall be still living and spirituous, after
that the said salt or praecipiolum is divided from it; and that the soma Aquae
Philosophicae is the Mare seu fons Precipiost; and that the Electrum mineralc
immaturum, is the fons Aquae Philosophicae.

5. Paracelsus says, That when the Aqua philosophica shall come to its loca
Dectinata, it shall leave its Salt or Praecipiolum behind it, in form of Ice,
or Hoar Frost, and that the aqua philosophica will go away Spirituous, and
remain a Spirituous water, The loca destinata where the aqua philosophica shall
leave its Sal or Praecipiolum, is the philosophic Magnet both Male and Female,
to wit, antimony and Lead. The male Magnet viz. antimony philosophic is the
best place, by reason of its fixation and purity; and the next to that is the
Female. In this Salt or Praecipiolum lies hidden the whole Art of Chemistry; if
a Chemist knows not how to make and divide this Sal or Praecipiolum from its
aqua philosophica, he will fail of the whole Art.

6. This Sal or Praecipiolum is the matter whereof is made the Philosophers
Mercury, that is, when it is reduced into its first matter, which is into a
most clear water, transparent as. Crystal. It is then slippery, and will eat
and drink its own Blood, and multiply it self with it per infinitum. And this
Water will bring all Metals, as Gold, and Silver into their first matter. Being
thus prepared Philosophically (without any thing of a Corrosive) it cures
Hydropem, Podagram, Morbum Venereum, and many other Diseases.

7. The Philosophers call this Water their Wine; and its Sal or Praecipiolum
its Tarta^^: both make the spiritum Vini Philosophicum, which Paracelsus calls
now and then Astrum Mercur ij, and spiritum Mercurij, his Sal Armoniacum, his
sal Minerale, his Balneum Mariae, his Horse-dung, his Fire, with an hundred
other Names to deceive the Vulgar.

8. The Process of the salt or Pracipiolum. Take aqua philosophica well
purified and filtred, ten parts: of the philosophers Magnet male or female, one
part (not the common which the Vulgar use, but the philosophic Magnet
cleansed; the male with Oil of Tartar per deliquium; the female with Oil of
Potashes) made into fine Powder. Make a mixture of both in a warm Glass
Mortar, mixing them well. Then put this mixture, into a Retort (as hereafter
shall be directed) and put it on an Earthen Capel or an Earthen Pan, with one
part clear Sand, and three times as much fisted Ashes; and cover it with
another Earthen Pan, and put to it a little Receiver with out luting of it, and
then make a Fire in your. Furnace, and give indifferent heat; now and then take
the Pan from it, and when you see the philosophic water is distilled from the
Magnet, (whether Male or Female) cover it again, and let the Fire go out. The
next Morning, take your Retort and Receiver, and if any part hang in the Neck
of the Retort, you shall wipe it off with a Feather, to the other a^^a
philosophica which is in the Receiver. If you will, you may now and then hold a
glowing Cole to the Neck of the Retort, that the thickened or condensed aqua
philosophica may run to the other which is in the Retort. When you have
separated the aqua philosophica, then scrape your male Magnet (which will lie
at the bottom of the Retort) with a crooked Iron, take it out, and put it into
a Glass Mortar, powder it small, and mingle or mix it with your aqua
philosophica again, by degrees or by little and little, and put this mixture
again into the Retort (or else you will loose your Sal or Praecipiolum) and
distill it again, as before, now and then taking the Pan from it, to see if the
aqua philosophica be almost all gone over; and if it be, let the fire go out,
and cover with the Earthen Pan again, and let it stand till the next Morning,
and then take the Retort and Recipient again from the Furnace, or out of the
Sand, and wipe your aqua philosophica again with a Feather, out of the Neck of
the Retort, to the other aqua philosophica, which is in the Recipient; scraping
also again with your Crooked Iron, your magnet out of the Retort. This done,

9. Put it again into a glass Mortar, (where observe, you shall distill so, that
the aqua philosophica, may go from the magnet, and that no aqua philosophica be
found with it, at the bottom of the Retort;) and powder again very small, and
dissolve again your Magnet in your Aqua philosophica, by little and little as
is before mentioned: you will find that the Magnet and Water will not so well
dissolve and mix together, as they did at the first and second time then take
it, and put it again into the Retort, and distill again, as before (not casting
any Powder away, which you may think to be faeces, for then you will lose your
Sast or Praes cipiolum.) Take your glass out of the Furnace, or out of the said
Capel, scrape your magnet with your crooked Iron, out of the Retort, and you
shall find that your Magnet is much increased, if you weigh it; The reason is,
the Magnet is the attractive which draws forth the Salt: Or the Magnet is the
Cask wherein the Philosophers Wine has let fall its Tartar; which Paracelsus
calls, Praecipiolum or Salt.

10. To separate the Salt or Praecipiolum from the Magnet. Take the Magnet
which you have scraped out of the Retort, and Powder it very small, with which
mingle the Aqua Philosophica by degrees, or by little and little. Your Magnet
will hardly mix with your Aqua philosophica. The reason is, the Magnet is full
of the Salt or Precipiolum; and then it is time to separate the Praecipiolum
from the Magnet and Aqua philosophica, (which is a Woman's work; when her
Clothes are foul, she washes them from their foulness:) the same way you must
cleanse, or separate the Praecipiolum from magnet, and Aqua philosophica, as
follows;

11. When you have the sign, that your Aqua philosophica will hardly mix with
your magnet; Or that the magnet will not enter into the aqua philosophica: Then
pour on it the fairest Water, (distilled Water is best) three fingers breadth
above the magnet, and aqua philosophica, which wash together in the Mortar with
a Pestle very well, till the Water is bluish black: Then it is a sign that the
magnet lets fall its Tartar, salt, or Praecipiolum, into the Water. Pour off
this Water into a Glass; but be careful that not any of the aqua philosophica
goes off with it: (for this philosophic Liquor will no more mix with common
fair Water, than Oil and Water will mix.) Put more fresh Water upon your magnet
and aqua philosophica, and wash it again, till the Water is blew again: Pour it
off as aforesuid. Thus continuing washing, till your Water remains white. Put
this last Water to the other Waters in the Glass, and cover the Glass very
close, that not any foulness may fall into the Glass.

12. The Praecipiolum being thus washed away, the aqua philosophica will again
dissolve the magnet, as Wax will dissolve in Oil: Take the mixture or
dissolution aforesaid, dry it upon warm Ashes very softly with a Sponge, or on
Paper, and by a little heat, that the mixture may be dry, which put again into
the Retort, and distill it, as aforesaid, (by Sect. 8. and 9.) so long till the
magnet will hardly be dissolved by the aqua philosophica, then separate again
the Precipiolum, as aforesaid, by Sect. 10. and 11.)

13. Now observe, I gave you charge, that you should keep your glass close
wherein you put your blewest Water, which will be clear, and a Powder at
bottom, which is some of the Precipiolum. The clear Water pour off (without
disturbing it) as soon as you can into another Glass. Now when that you see
that the magnet will scarcely be dissolved by your aqua philosophica, or not
without great trouble; pour the same Water which you poured off from the
Precipiolum, upon your mixture or dissolution, and wash it again, till the
Water is bluish, as aforesaid, which pour off, and continue so doing till the
Water is colorless, by Sect. 11.

14. Then take the mixture again, and dry it, and repeat the same work again
(by Sect. 12.) till you have the sign; which wash again with the aforesaid
Water (by Sect. 13.) and you shall find that your Praecipiolum will augment
daily: this distillation and washing shall you continue, till the aqua
philosophica is freed from all its salt or Praecipiolum.

15. Observe, that if the Water should grow less and less, you may add to it
(as need requires) fresh Water. Now the sign when the aqua philosophica has
lost all its salt, or its Tartar, or its Coagulatum, or Praecipiolum, is, that
that aqua philosophica will Eternally dissolve the magnet, so that they will
always mix well together: and if you should a thousand times offer to dissolve
the magnet in the said Water, and as often distill the one from the other, yet
they will still dissolve again and mix: and if you should wash them a thousand
times with fresh Water, the Water will be clear and not bluish. As long as any
Sal or Praecipiolum is in the aqua philosophica, you cannot distill two, three,
or four times the aqua philosophica from the magnet, but it will be difficult
to mix, the one with the other; and when that you will have it to mix, you must
wash it, and then it will mix well again. But when that the Salt or
Praecipiolum is all separated from the aqua philosophica, it will mix firmly
after a thousand Distillations, as aforesaid. And if it be washed a thousand
times, the Water will always remain clear.

16. To prepare the Praecipiolum to a Medicine. Pour the clear Waters from the
Powder, which lies at the bottom in the Glass, that no Water may be left on the
Powder: put the Glass on a little warm Ashes, that the Powder may dry, which
will look bluish yellow. Put this Powder into a little Cucurbit Glass or
Bolt-head, and distill off from it, the Water of Eggs, five or six times; or so
long till the Powder becomes Red; and then distill off from it (five or six
times) Spirit of Wine, so is it fitted for Medicine. Dose is gr.ij. or almost
gr.iij.

17. To make the Water of Eggs. Take a good quantity of Eggs; boil them very
hard: take the Whites and cut them very small, and distill them in an Alembick
per Cineres, very softly; till you have got all the Water from the Whites: then
take the Eggshells, calcine them, put them into a Retort, put upon them the
former (that is their own) Water, and distill per arenam with a strong Fire. Put
this Water upon the Ashes again, and distill it again, thus continue it five or
six times; so the Water will be sitted for the Praecipiolum.

18. The Philosophers Key, which is the Sal Salis, or Salt of the Praecipiolum.
You may remember that I gave you Instruction, that you should pour off the
clear Water from the Praecipiolum, and you should make dry the Praecipiolum,
and bring it into a Medicinal red Powder: Or, you should bring it into its
first matter, which shall bring all Metals, principally its own Body into its
first matter, which cannot be done without the Sal praecipioli, which is hidden
in the Water you pour off from the Praecipiolum. That same Water, filter
through brown Paper, and set the Water to evaporate in a round Glass, very
sostly in Ashes. When the Water is evaporated away, you shall sind at the
bottom of the Glass, a yellow whitish Salt, which is Sal praecipioli, and the
Clavis Philosophorum, wherewith they do unlock the lock of the Praecipiolum,
which brings the same into its first matter. If you know not this Salt, you
know nothing of the true Chemistry. This Salt does decrease in the decrease of
the Moon, and increase in the Full. One grain will purge very softly all
Podagra's, Venertal and Hydropical humors, with gr.ij of the Praecipiolum
prepared.

19. To bring the Praecipiolum into its first matter, or slippery Water.

Take of the Salt p j: of the Praecipiolum, p. ij: being dry; first dissolve
the Salt in fair-warm Water, and put it upon the Praecipiolum, and evaporate it
away very gently in warm Ashes, with a very gentle fire, then is the
Precipiolum with its own Salt, then put it into a little Retort, nip up the
Neck of the Retort very close, then put it into Balneum Vaporosum, and let it
stand SIX WEEKS in Digestion, or to Putrify, and it will turn a slimy Water.
Take the Retort, and open the Neck, and lay the Retort in a Sand Furnace, and
cover it with an Earthen Pan, fixing to it a Receiver well Luted: give first a
slow Fire, then a stronger; which continue till the Spirits be well resolved
into Water. First the Spirit will come forth in white Clouds, or in Smoke; and
at last in the form of red Clouds or Smoke: give Fire so long, till all the
Spirits be come over in a clear white Water; and when you have this sign, take
the Receiver from the Retort, stopping the said Receiver very well with Wax,
that no Spirits may fly away; then let the Fire go out.

20. The Matter or Water which remains in the Retort, take out, and put into a
Bolt-head: stop it well, set it in a warm place. Then rectify once the Spirits
which are in the Receiver, and keep them carefully: now observe this; you
remember, that when the aqua philosophica has lost its salt or Praecipiolum,
that the same Water will be as clear as Rock Crystal. Take of this Water one
part, of the spirit aforesaid two parts; put them into a Bolt-head, stop it
very close, and let it stand in a little warmth, and the aqua philosophica will
mix with the Spirit: then distill all through a Retort in Sand. Take again of
the aforesaid Water which is clear as Rock-Crystal, p. j 2 of the said Spirit
p. ij: put them into a Bolt head, set it in a warm place and the aqua
philosophica, will mix with the Spirit: Then distill apa^n ut supra, and it will
come over in form of Water; this continue so long, till all one half part of
the clear aqua philosophica is brought to a clear thin Water, which keep very
close stopped with Wax. Take the Powder which I ordered to be kept in a
Bolthead, and place it very deep in a Sand Capel, and give a strong fire for
twenty four hours, then let the fire go out, and take the Bolt-head forth, and
stir the Powder with a Wooden stick, and put it upon the half part of the
clear, thin, philosophiclt Water, stopping the Glass with Hermes Seal: shake
it, and let it stand in digestion in a warm place for three or four days. Then
pour off this into another Glass; and pour upon the remainder of the powder,
the other half of the Water, sealing the Glass again, and letting it stand ut
supra for three or four days: then put it to the former Water, and seal up the
Glass Hermetically, letting it stand in in Balneo Vaporoso eight days. After
distill it through a Retort, and if any thing remain in the Retort, (which will
be very little) pour upon it the Spirit again, and distill till all is come
over. Now is the Salt with its own Spirit, and brought into the first matter:
keep it very well stopped.

21. This is the Water which the Philosophers have given diverse Names to, as
their Horse-dung, Balneum Mariae, and Caix Viva; and in Sum, this is the
Philosophers true Fire, without which no true work can be done in Chemistry.

22. The Philosopher has brought sorth this Salamander which will never wast in
the Fire, the longer the stronger: This Water will increase or multiply per
Infinitum, that is to say, if all the Sea were Mercury, it would turn the same
into the first matter. First, you must wash your Mercury with Salt and Vinegar,
diverse times, and at last with Water, to wash away the Salt. Then mix this
Mercury with Calx Viva, and Tartar calcined; distill it in a Retort in a Sand
Furnace, and lay to it a Receiver, filled almost half full of Water, that the
Mercury may fall into it, and coagulate, which dry, and squceze it eight or ten
times through Leather, so will your Mercury be well purged from all its
uncleaness.

23. This is the Mercury which you shall use in multiplying your Spirit or
astrum philosophicum of this Mercury, p. j: of the astrum philosophicum p. ij:
put them into a Bolthead, stop it close, and let it stand in a warm place one
Night, so will the Mercury melt in the Spirit or astrum philosophicum, and turn
into Water; then distill it through a Retort. Thus may you do by repeating the
Spirit with fresh Mercury, as long as you please.

24. This Water will dissolve Gold, Silver, and all sorts of Stones, and bring
them over with it, through a Retort. Gold and Silver thus dissolved, can never
be separated one from another: the reason is, because they, and all other
Metals are of the same Nature, and have beginning from the same Water: there is
nothing in the World, but has its begin ing from it.

25. Medicina Vniversalis, the universal Medicine. Take of your male magnet in
Powder ( viz. the same which did remain when you made the Praecipiolum) one
part; of the female magnet two parts in fine Powder: put each by it self into a
Glass; pour upon each the astrum philosophicum, so much as may overtop them a
fingers breadth; stop each glass very close, and let them stand in a warm place
for eight days, and the magnets male and female, will be almost all dissolved
into Water; then pour ^ff this Water, each by it self into a Glass, and put
more Water to the maguers male and female which yet remains; let it stand again
eight days in a warm place; and then pour off these Waters to the former
Waters; so will the magnets be dissolved into Water, but there will remain some
faeces.

26. Take of both of these Waters a quarter part, and put them together into a
Bolt-head, so as three quarters may be empty; Seal it Hermetically, digest it
in an Athanor, in a continual warm heat, till it comes to a fixed Red Stone or
Powder: Before it comes a red Powder, there will appear many colors, as Black,
Green, and Yellow, and then Red: when it is very Red, and a Powder, take the
Bolt-head, and bury it in a Sand Capel very deep, and give fire by degrees, and
at last a very strong fire, and it will melt like Wax: let it stand one whole
week (but the longer the better) then take it out, and let it cool; after break
up your Glass, and you will find a sixth Stone or Ponder, and Red as Scarlet.

27. Now you may remember, that I bid you keep three parts of your magnets male
and female which were dissolved into Water: put both these Waters together into
a Retort, distill them, and both the magnets will go over with the Water through
the Retort, with which Water you shall multiply your Medicine. Now take of your
Medicine one part (in fine Powder) and put it into a little Bolthead, putting
upon it, twice as much of your Waters, as of the magnets male and female, Seal
it again, and digest it in an Athanor, till it do come to a Red Powder, and
then pat it again into the Sand Capel (as at Sect. 26.) thus may you multiply
ad insinitum.

28. To make the Astrum Horiz ntale, Or Golden fixed praecipitate. Take the most
fine Gold, and make it into a Ponder, dissolve it in your Astrum Mercurij, as
much as you will: distill it through a Retort once or twice, and your Gold will
go over a long with your Water, and will never be separated one from another,
for they are both of one Nature. Now take the Praecipiolum which is made dry,
(not that which is made already into a Medicine) put it into a little Cucurbit
Glass; and put upon it the Magnetic astrum mercurij, and distill from it three
or four times very slowly; but at last very strongly; so will your praecipiolum
be Red and fixed.

29. The same may be done with Mercury purged, it will fix the same into a red
Powder.

30. The same Work may be done with Silver, or with your praecipiolum. No man
can find out all the Secrets which are hidden in this Philosophical Menstruum,
the true ALKAHEST of Paracelsus.

APPENDIX. Concerning the Circulatum Majus, Circulatum Minus; the Mercury of
Luna, the process of the Grand Elixir of Paracelsus; and the Table of HERMES.
I. Of the Circulatum Majus Paracelsi.
31. If you would reduce the Mercury of the Vulgar into its first liquid Ens,
then it is to be first mortified, and brought out of its own form; and that is
done by various sublimations with Vitriol and common Salt, that so it may be at
last like fixed Crystal; then dissolve it in its own Matrix, viz. in the first
Ens of Salt, putrify it for a Month; corrupt it with new Arcanum of Salt, that
the impure thereof may be praecipitated to the bottom, and that the pure may be
turned into Crystals: sublime the Stones or Crystals, in a close Reverberatory,
when it is sublimed, always turn it upside down, until it comes to a redness.
Extract this Sulphur with Spirit of Wine, rectified even to the height;
separate the S.V. digest it for a time, and distill it: Then the Arcanum of the
first Ens of Mercury, will come over in a liquid substance, the which is called
by the Philosophers, a most sharp Metaline Acetum; and in Our Archidoxis,
Circulatum Majus. Thus may you do with Antimony, Gems and Herbs.

II. Of the Circulatum Minus Paracelsi.
32. Take in the first place, the true Element of Water; or instead thereof
another Salt, as is not yet boiled to dryness: Or, even Sal Gen depurated; put
thereto two parts of Water, mixed with a little Juice of Radish; putrefy it
again for a Month, then distill it by a Retort, urge the residue by a strong
fire, that so it may flow or melt, reverberate it in the Retort, with a
continued sire, dissolve it on a Marble, then take that water which flows from
hence and put it on again, and putrefy it; distill it again, even to an
Oyliness, conjoyn it with S. V. and the impure will fall to the bottom, the
which separate, but the pure will be Crystalized in the cold: pour on again,
that which is distiled, and cohobate it so often, till a fixed Oil remain in the
bottom, and that nothing comes over but sweet afterward. Again, digest it for
a Month, and then distill it so long, until the Arcanum of the Salt passes over
by an Alembick. Let not the length of laboring here grieve thee, for this is
the third part of all Arcana's, hid in Metals and Minerals, and without it can
nothing fruitful or perfect be accomplished.

33. Now although there are more ways for the Extracting of the first Ens of
Salts, yet the former is the most profitable, and the most ready way; and next
to it, is the Process of the Elixir of Salt, following in the next Section,
viz. That new Salt being permixed with the dissolving Water (which dissolving
Water, is every where throughout all Paracelsus to be understood, the distilled
Spirit or Oil of Salt) be putrified and distilled so long, until the whole
substance of the Salt be dissolved and reduced into a perpetual and during
Oyliness, the body being removed therefrom, in the likeness of Phlegm. Thus is
made the Arcana's of Vitriol, Tartar, and other Salts.

34. Processus Elixiris Salis Paracelsi. We will here describe the Practick of
the Elixir of Salt more plainly. Take Salt excellently well prepared, the
whitest and cleanest, put it into a Pelican, with such a quantity of Aqua
Solvens, or the dissolving Water, ( viz. distilled Spirit or Oil of Salt) as
may be six times its weight, let them be digested together, in Horse-dung, for
a Month. Then let the dissolving Water be separated by distillation, and be
again poured on, and be separated as before, this let be don so often, until
the Salt be converted into an Oil, whereto let be added, an eighth part of the
Quintessence of Gold, and let them be digested together in a Pelican and in
Horse-dung, for four Months; and let them be circulated for a Month after: then
add another part of circulated Wine, which circulate yet a Month longer, this
time being over, you have the Elixir of Salt, of the which we have made for Our
selves, a Memorial as a Pattem, for the succoring (...) lightning of our
ancient days.

III. Of the Mercury of Luna.
35. AF. and dissolve filings of fine Luna therein, then put all into a glass
body or Cucurbit, and distill away the AF. or else evaporate it away; and the
Luna will remain in the bottom in a fine lime. If you would have it finer, put
fresh AF. upon the Luna again, and do, as aforesaid. This Calx of Luna grind
very well with Sal Armoniack, then put them into a glass with a little Fountain
Water; put them upon hot Ashes, stir^ing and moving them about for an hour;
afterward take away the Sal Armoniack by often washing with hot water, and dry
the Luna; being dry, take some Oil of Tartar, and imbibe the Luna with it, and
let it dry; imbibe it again, doing thus three times; then put the Luna into a
glass Body, and cast some of the said Oil upon it, that it may be three inches
above the Luna: put them upon hot Ashes, the space of twenty four hours, the
Oil will become black, pour it off by inclination, and put more new upon the
Luna; thus continue till the Oil comes forth no more black: after which, dry
the Calk of Luna very well.

36. Take this dried Calx, put it into another Glass, and cast upon it
distilled Vinegar, Oil of Tartar, and Oil of Salt, Ana: (some doubt whether the
Oil of Tartar should not be Oil of S^l Armoniack) mix the Oils with the Vinegar
well, before you put them to the Luna, then move and stir them well, lute all
dilligently, and put them into Horse-dung to digest, for the space of sixteen
days. This done, distill away the humidity; sublime the Sal Armoniack, and wash
away the Tartar with warm water (or with warm Spirit of Vinegar which is
better) so will your Luna be in running Mercury very quick.

37. But if all the Luna is not dissolved into running Mercury, wash it well
from its blackness, and grind it well, dry it, and put it into a Crucible with
Luna in very thin leaves, which lay, stratum super stratum: put the pot upon a
good fire, blowing it, and when it begins to melt, cast all into hot water, and
it will be running Mercury.

IV. The precess of the Grand Elixir of Paracelsns.
38. Out of the Corporeal Life, viz. vulgar Mercury, extract the first liquid
Ens, (as being a Celestial fire) the Quintessence of Sol, and a sharp Metaline
Acctum, by a solution with its own Mother; that is, he must permix it with the
Arcanum of Salt, and with the stomach of Anthion; that is, with the Spirit of
Vitriol, and must therein dissolve the coagulated Mercury of Antimony, digest
it, and afterward reduce it in Crystals, that it may be like to a yellowish
Crystal.

39. Or thus. Take the Mineral Electrum in filings, put it into its own Sperm,
that its defilements may be washed away, and purge it to the utmost, as much as
you can with Stibium, after a Chemical manner, lest that otherwise thou
should suffer loss, by reason of its impurity. Then resolve in it the Stomach
of the Ostritch, which is born in the Earth, and is comforted and strengthened
in its virtue, by the sharpness of the Eagle. When the Electrum is consumed,
and has, after its solution, gotten a Marigold color, be not unmindful of
reducing it, into a Spirituous transparent Essence, re^embling the color of
true Amber. Add to it, half so much only, of the extended Eagle, as the
corporeal Electrum (before its preparation) weighed; and oft-times abstract
thencefrom the Stomach of the Ostrich, for so thy Electrum will be still more
and more spirituous. But when the Stomach of the Ostrich is wearied, or spent
with labor, it is fit that thou refreshest or renewest it, and from time to
time abstractest it. Then lastly, when it has again lost its sharpness, add
the Tartariz'd Quintessence, but in such a proportion, as to overtop it four
inches in height, that so it may be deprived of its redness, and may pass or
distill over together therewithal; this do so long and so often until it becomes
white of it self. Then when it is enough, (for thou will see with thine Eyes
how it will sit it self for sublimation) and thou perceivest that sign, sublime
it; and so the Electrum will be converted into the Whiteness of the exalted
Eagle; and it is brought thus to pass, and is transmuted by a little labor: Now
this is that we seek for, for our use in Medicine, with the which thou may
make a safe progress in many Diseases, which will not yield to vulgar
Medicines. Thou may likewise convert the same into a Water, an Oil, or a red
Powder, and use it in all such Medicinal Cases as need requires: and herein
lies so great a Virtue in Curing Men, that there cannot be found out a more
certain, and more excellent Medicine in the whole World. The Electrum being
destroyed, as aforesaid, if thou would make a farther progress, and arrive to
thy wished end; Take the destroyed and flying made, or Volatilized Electrum, as
much as thou have a desire to perfect, and put it in a philosophical Egg,
sealing it excellently well, that nothing may evaporate. Let it stand so long
in an Athanor until it does of it self, without any addition begin to be
resolved from above; in such-wise, that there be an appearance of, as it were,
an Island in the midst of the Sea, the which does day by day grow less and
less, till at last it be changed into the deepest black. This black, is the
Bird which flies without Wings in the Night, the which even the first
Celestial Dew, has by a perpetual Coction, and ascension and descension
transmuted into the blackness of the Head of a Crow, the which does afterward
assume the Peacocks Tail, and then gets the Feathers of the Swan, and last of
all, receives the highest redness of the whole World; the which is a sign of
its fiery Nature; by the which fire it expels all the accidents of the Body,
and cherishes the old and decayed Members. This Preparation is done (according
as all Philosophers affirm) in one only Vessel, one Furnace, one Fire; the
vaporous Fire never ceasing. By this Celestial and perfect Medicine, may all
the defilements of Metals be washed away; and their hidden parts be made
manifest: For this same more than perfect Medicine can do all things; it
penetrates all things, and infuses or pours in Health, in that very self same
time when it expels the Evil and the Disease. Give heed to this Preparation,
for it is the cause of Solution; and to the glorified, destroyed, and
spiritualized Electrum, use the Tartarized Arcanum, to wash off the
superfluities which happen in the preparation, least you labor in Vain:
however nothing of the Arcanum of Tartar will remain, but you are to proceed
with it only Circularly; for so it easily becomes of it self in the
Philosophical Egg, and vapor of the Fire, a Philosophical Water, the which
Philosophers call a viscou^ Water, it will also coagulate it self, and
represent it self in all colors, and at last be adorned with the highest
redness. Of this Mystery I am prohibited to write more plain, because it is at
the dispose of the Divine Power.

40. Or thus. In the Name of God, Take Mercury, or else the Element of Mercury,
and separate the pure from the impure: afterward let it be reverberated even
to a whiteness, the which sublime with Sal Armoniack so long until it be
resolved: let it be calcined, and again dissolved, and be digested in a
Pelican a month; then at length let it be coagulated into a Body. This Body is
no more combustible, nor consumable by any manner of means, but abides in the
same State. Those Bodies which it penetrates are permanent in the Cineritium or
Cupel, and cannot in the least be reduced into nothing, or be altered; but this
Stone takes away every superfluous quality from sensible and insensible things,
as we have before declared. And albeit we have set down a short way, yet it
requires labor, and needs such an operator as is not ignorant, or will be
weary, but such an one as is highly dilligent and expert.

41. Or thus. Take the first matter, digest it in a Flacco, a flat, or flattish
Vessel, in a Resolutive digestion for a month: then let the addition of a
Monarchy be added thereunto in an equal weight, and let them be again digested
for a Month or two; then distill this matter over by a Retort, and that which
shall ascend shall be the Arcanum of the first matter, of which we here Write.
None can have a reason to admire at this so short away and process, for
multitudes of Words bring much error.

V. Processus Elixiris Tutonicus.
42. In the Name of God Amen. Take pure Gold well purged by Antimony p.ij:
Mercury of Luna p.vj: Vulgar Mercury well purged and cleansed from all filth
p.xij: put them into a glass Mattress, with a glass cover, and work according to
Art; These three following Operations.

43. The first Operation. Hang the Mattress three Inches distance from a very
gentle fire, moving sometimes by little and little the Mattress, until you see
the matter dissolved, and of various colors. But first you shall see the
Peacocks Tail, which presently vanishes away: and immediately upon it, after
the dissolution, you shall see the Crows-head: then follows Saturn, which is
blackness: after that Jupiter of an Ash color, which does immediately vanish:
After that comes the Pearls in the Circumference, then presently take away the
matter from the fire, which will congeal in a black somewhat whitish; much like
the Wrinkles in an old Woman's Face: this Operation is commonly performed in the
space of an hour.

44. The second Operation. This being done, conjoyn the matters together before
the Vessel is cold, and hang it upon the fire; following this second operation
with a very soft fire, as is aforesaid; and you shall see a little Skin like a
Spiders Webb, swimming over it, which vanishes away, and is a fore token of
whiteness, and this is Narcissus Fountain. Leave now, until you see the matter
boil of it self, which is a sign of its Birth and hour of its Nativity; and the
matter will be sublimed, but not so much as it did before, because it is more
fixed. Now shall you see the matter to wax all white, the which is called the
foliate Earth, and the matter will open in two parts, and move of its Self,
which is properly the hour of its Nativity or Birth, which must at all times be
observed. This done, you shall see Pearls in the Circumference, then shall you
take it off from the fire, and the matter will congeal very White; the which is
done also, in the space of one hour or little more. You must note, That you are
to take great heed of the drops which are sublimed, that they do not fall by
too much heat: and for that lest you should not see so perfectly, the hour of
the Nativity, because the matter does move principally when the drops do fall.

45. The third Operation. Hang it over a very gentle fire, and there let it
sublime a little; and you shall see Mars and Venus, before the separation of
the Elements; proceed with a very gentle fire, until you see the matter to turn
it self into Powder like fine flower. But take heed that the drops do not fall,
if possible it may be, because the Work will be so much the longer; and you may
the better see the separation of the Elements in the bottom of the Glass. That
is to say, the special form of the Gold separated from its Mercury
Philosophical, which was made in the same hour of the Nativity, the which is
then Rebis, because it is inseparable from its Solar Sulphur; for then is made
the Copulation of the Male with the Female, by means of Vulgar Mercury. This
done, and that you have seen the pure separation of the Elements, take it from
the Fire, that it may cool a little, and conjoyn the matters together, and
dissolve it as you know, and as Nature requires.

46. This Work is done in the space of two Months, wherein the matter will be
black like Pitch; and in form of a Pultise or Pap, and will be a natural black,
the which by little and little vanishes away; but this is a true sign of a
perfect dissolution, viz the Ash Color, and coming a little after to the
White, which will be in the space of two Months. Then shall you see the Work to
be true; for it will congeal and fix Mercury into Luna; but is not yet fixed;
but continuing the fire in the same degree unto the seventh Month, then shall
you make your Projection upon Vulgar Mercury purged; with five parts of Silver,
which will be frangible or brittle, and a Medicine upon the aforesaid Mercury:
one part upon fifty parts of common Mercury purged.

47. But if you intend for the Red; you must increase your fire to the third
degree; so will the matter by degrees become yellowish; ( geelachtich, a Dutch
word;) continue the same degree, and by little and little it will become Red;
and in the space of two Months, a most perfect Red; then take it off from the
Furnace, and in a naked Fire calcine it; then is it a general Medicine for the
Body of Mankind, the which if you so please, you may augment both in quantity
and quality. Thus putting its equal weight of the same Mercury, (of which you
began the Work) made perfect, as aforesaid (which is a work of three days,) and
so you may continue until you have enough, or as much as you please, and all
this shall be true Medicine for Humane Bodies; till the projection or
fermentation be made upon the Body of Sol; then it will serve only for the
Metals. And first you shall make the brittle Sol, as before you made the
brittle Luna; so will it be a Medicine for Sol: you may project one part of
this Medicine, upon fifty parts of fine Luna; and it will be all fine Sol: but
you may multiply it to Infinity: I my self have only seen it to fifty: the
which I attest to be true, under the Silence Philosophical, the which I have
here freely given Thee by the Faith of a Christian.

VI. The Process of the great Elixir according to Divi Leschi, Genus Amo.
48. Take of our Earth through Eleven degrees, gr. xj: of Our Gold, and not of
the Vulgar, gr. j: of Our Luna, not of the Vulgar gr. ij: but be then
admonished that thou take not the Gold and Silver of the Vulgar, for they are
Dead; but take Ours which are Living; then put them into Our Fire, and there
will thence be made a dry Liquor. First the Earth will be resolved into Water,
which is called the Water of Philosophers; and in that Water it will resolve
the Bodies of the Sun and Moon, and consume them, that there remains but the
tenth part with one part, and this will be the humidum Radicale Metallicum.
Then take the Water of the Sal Niter of Our Earth, in which there is a living
stream, if thou digest the pit Knee deep. Take therefore the Water of it, but
take it clear, and set over it the humidum Radicale, and put it over the Fire
of putrefaction and generation, but not such as was that in the first
operation. Govern all things with a great deal of discretion, until there
appear colors like to the Tail of a Peacock: govern it by digesting of it, and
be not weary till these colors cease, and there appears throughout the whole,
a green color, and so of the rest. And when thou shall see in the bottom,
Ashes of a fiery color, and the Water almost red; open the Vessel, dip in a
Feather, and smear over some Iron with it; if it Tinge, have in readiness that
Water which is the Menstruum of the World (out of the Sphere of the Moon so
often rectified, until it can calcine Gold) put in so much of that Water, as
was the cold Air, which went in: boil it again with the former Fire, until it
Tinge again.

VII. The Process of the Elixir according to Pontanus.
49. Take the matter and grind it with a Physical contrition, as dilligently as
may be, then set it upon the Fire, and let the proportion of the Fire be known,
to wit, that it only stir up the matter; and in a short time that fire, without
any other laying on of Hands, will accomplish the whole Work, because it will
putrefy, corrupt, generate and perfect, and make to appear, the three principal
colors, black, white, and red. And by the means of Our fire, the Medicine will
be multiplied, if it be conjoined with the crude matter, not only in quantity,
but also in Virtue. Withal they might therefore search out this Fire, which is
mineral, equal, continual, vapors not away, except it be too much stirred up;
pertakes of Sulphur, is taken from elsewhere, then from the matter; puts
down all things, dissolveth, congealeth, and calcines, and is artificial to
find out, and that by a compendious and near way, without any cost, at least
very small, is not transmuted with the matter, (because it is not matter) and
thou shall attain thy wish, because it does the whole Work, and is the Key of
the Philosophers, which they never revealed.

VIII. The Smaragdine Table of Hermes, from whence all Alchymy did arise.
50. True without falsity, certain and most true: That which is Inferior, is
as that which is Superior; and that which is Superior is as that which is
Inferior, for the accomplishing of the Miracies of one thing. And as all
things were from One, by the Mediation of One; so all things have proceeded
from this one thing by adaption: the Father thereof is the Sun; and the Mother
thereof the Moon; The Wind carried it in its Belly: the Nurse thereof is the
Earth: This is the Father of all the perfection of the whole World: the Virtue
thereof is entire, if it be turned into Earth. Thou shall separate the Earth
from the fire, the subtle from the thick, sweetly with a great deal of
Judgment. It ascends from the Earth up to Heaven, and again descends down to
the Earth, and receives the Powers of Superiors, and Inferiors: So thou have
the Glory of the whole World. Therefore let all obscurity fly from thee. This
is the strong fortitude of the whole fortitude, because it shall overcome every
thing that is subtle, and penetrate every solid thing, as the World is
created. Hence shall wonderful Adaptations be, whereof this is the manner;
wherefore I am called Hermes Trismegistus, having three parts of the Philosophy
of the whole World. It is complete, what I have spoken of the operation of the
Sun.

IX. The fixation of Sol and Mercury.
51. Take very thin plates of pure fine Gold, which heat red hot: put them so
heated into a Crucible, in which Hungarian or Spanish Mercury is cast, being
set upon hot Embers so as the Mercury begins to smoke first. Put in first one
plate red hot, then another, and so one after another, as you see them
dissolved; so will the Mercury drink up the plates of Gold. The proportion of
the Gold to the Mercury, is as 1. to 24 viz. to one dram of Gold, three ounces
of Mercury; such is the proportion, be the quantities never so great: so will
the Amalgama be soft as Pap, and it will be a firm and good Amalgama, Put this
mixture into a Glass Bolt-head, with a long Neck: set it in a fit Sand-heat
firmly Sealed up: increase it gradually, till you have a strong fire, so that
the Mercury does boil: continue and keep the said fire the space of five days
and nights. And constantly as you see the Mercury to ascend up by the sides of
the Glass, put it down again, with a linen cloth fastened to the end of a stick
fitted to that purpose. Thus continue the matter with fervent fire, till the
whole Amalgama is turned into a subtle red Powder, as red as Dragons Blood, and
so dry, that no part of the Mercury does appear. Then let it cool, and you have
a certain Calx for the Red work, which is firm and good: This Calx may be fixed
by a due digestion in a gentle heat, and if it be dissolved in the Water of the
Philosophers, it may be augmented and made Spiritual, so as it shall penetrate,
transmute, and fix all Metals, but chiefly Luna into fine Sol. The same may be
done with Luna for the white Work, which will penetrate, transmute and fix both
Jupiter and Venus into sine Luna: This subtle and transmutting matter is either
a Powder which with a gentle heat will melt like Wax into Oil: Or, it is an Oil
imcombustible, which penetrates all Metaline Substances: Or, it is a subtle
Volatile spirit, whose energy is a sixing Power, and sixes all other Volatile
things.

X. An Explication of the former Work by the Author.
52. First, The Seed of Gold is lodged in all Metals.

This is apparent from their generation in the Womb of Nature, whose
Origination is Mercury, which is indeed immaturate Gold: and so remains
immaturate in the baser Metals, till a ripening and meliorating Spirit quickens
that Seminal property, lodged in the Womb of impurity: moreover it has been
proved by the experience of many Operators and Alchymists, and made visible to
the Senses, what quantity of Gold a proportional quantity of every one of the
Metals have yielded; which although it has been a Work of no profit, yet has
given that satisfaction to prove the Truth of this proposition.

53. Secondly, This Seed of Gold, both may and ought to be quickened, or made to
Live.

This is done through the Death of the first matter, and disposition of the
second to a refuscitation or resurrection of that innate, energetical, and
seminal Life, and that only by the universal Spirit of the World, which is one
thing in the Fire; another thing in the Air; another thing in the Water; and
lastly, another thing in the Earth.

54. Thirdly, This Semen being quickened dilates it self into other Bodies, and
transmutes them into its own property.

That is, just as the Seminal Life of Vegetables transmutes or changes that
Succus or humidity of the Earth proper to themselves, into their own Forms and
Natures; and so of a little Seed there becomes a great Tree. So that the Earth
is the Womb, out of which so small a Seed becomes a great Tree, by the
transmuting property of the innate Seminal Life in the Seed. And so all the
Base Metals are the Wombs unto that Seminal purity? in which Womb, if the Seed
be disposed rightly, there will be as certain a generation and increase: And
the purity of the base Metals will be transmuted into that Seminal property to
a vast augmentation.

55. Fourthly, That this may be rightly done, the Bodies of the base M^tals
must be opened and prepared.

That is, they must be brought unto a mortification, that that strong band
which has hitherto chained the Seminal Life may be broken, and so the
energetick Vi^tue may be set at liberty. This is performed by the fiery flying
Dragon, who dev^urs all that he comes near. This being done, the Semen must be
cast into and conjoined with this mortified Body (impregnated with the
universal Spirit of the World,) that it may there generate, transmute and mix.
Now this Spirit is fourfold, according to a fourfold property, as we have said
at Sect. 53. aforegoing.

56. Fifthly, This may be done in any of the base Metals: but they (like the
Earth) yield an increase, according to their Degrees in purity; so that more of
the Body of a pure Metal is transmuted, than of an impure.

As Barren Earth cannot yield so great an Increase as a fertile Soil; so
neither can a Base Metal yield so great an augmentation, as a more fine: there
must be something in the Matrix into which the Seed is cast, which must be in
its own Root, homogene with it, else no Fruit can be expected; and according to
the quantity of the Homogene matter in the prepared Body, such is the increase.
If you should cast this Seed upon Chalk, Lime, or such like Hetorogene matter,
you may look till your Eyes fall out, before you see a Metaline Transmutation:
if you cast it upon a Philosophic Calx of Tin or Lead, etc. you will see a
transmutation, but only in part, according to the quantity of the Metaline or
Homogene root in the said Metals: but if it be cast upon a Philosophical Calx
of Luna, it transmutes the whole Body into most pure Sol; so that you may see,
that according to the degree of the Metaline perfection, such will be your
augmentation or increase.

57. Sixthly, The Bodies of the baser Metals being fitted, the Semen must be
cast into the same to generate,

That is, there must be a conjunction of the Semen or true Golden Essence, with
the prepared Body to be transmuted. Now you must be careful you use not the
Simple Body of any Metal for this Semen, for then you will be deceived. The
matter in which the generative Spirit is lodged is another thing. If you bury a
whole Tree or Plant in the Earth, it will not generate, and bring forth another
Tree, but Perish and Rot; the Seminal or Generative Virtue and Life is clogged
and loaded, and so is ineffective. But if you bury the Seed of the same Tree,
you may have another or more, according to the quantity of the Seed sown. The
same you must understand in the generation of Metals, and of the Golden Work.
It is not Gold which will generate Gold, but the Seed of Gold.

58. Seventhly, This Semen must be Volatile.

Otherwise it cannot transmute, for nothing but a Volatile Spirit or Essence
can dilate and spread it self. A fixed matter cannot operate at all; for all
fixed things are Dead, and their Life remains in a Centeral State, not sit for
Co-action. This is evident in the Volatile Salts of Vinegar and Quicklime,
which (by reason of their Volatility) surpass the Art of Man to attain Simple;
but if you mix a Lixivium of Quicklime with Vinegar, you may have a large
quantity of Salt, and that fixed, which was before unattainable. Thus you see
out of two Volatile things a third absolutely fixed is produced; and this is
the Condition of the great Work. But before this can be accomplished, you must
make fixed things become Volatile, which is done by the opposite Ration, for
while the matter is fixed, it cannot act in the least measure either to any
natural Generation, or Phylosophical Transmutation.

59. Eighthly, It must be of an unchangeable deep blood red color.

Otherwise it could not ^inge; for was it only yellow, it would only create a
faintish kind of Green. But this Our Philosophic Tincture does generate Gold
of the highest and purest Nature, and having the deepest yellow; perfectly and
thoroughly in every part and particle thereof imbibed with the Golden Spirit,
and having all the Virtues, Powers and Operations of Gold, in the highest and
largest measure.

60. Ninthly, This Semen is made Volatile by destruction of its external form.

That is, the matter out of which the Semen is drawn, must be opened by a
Philosophic Calcination, and separated by the beams of the Sun, by which the
Solar property will make an impression on the fixed matter to render it
Volatile. Nature must be brought to Action, and suffer a Revolution, that the
Dead or inactive Body may let fall its Semen, out of which the Golden Tree of
the Philosophers is produced.

61. Tenthly, This Semen is made Blood-red by impregnating of it with the
spirit of the World, and Blood of the Dragon.

It is necessary, That there be a common Band to conjoyn the Bodies which are
to be united. As the Bodies of the Base Metals, (which are the Womb for this
Seed) are to be Mortified; so must that Body be, out of which you extract the
Semen: and as that mortified and prepared Body is to be impregnated by the said
universal Spirit and Blood of the Dragon; so also must this Semen, that there
may be as well a Sympathy and likeness in Nature, as a Unity in Body.

62. Eleventhly, The matter out of which this Semen is to be extracted, is
Mercury, or Gold, or both.

We mean simply, and without Metaphor Quick silver and Gold: for if there be an
innate Life, Virtue and Power in the Base Metals, why not in these? If Lead,
Tin, Iron, Copper, and Silver, contain in themselves the Seminal Life of Gold,
and its Metaline root, why should Mercury or Sol be excluded, which are the
things themselves?

63. Twelfthly, This Semen being cast into the Body prepared for it, is there
to be digested, till both be perfectly united; whose simple conjunction is the
product of the Golden Kingdom.

This Digestion is perfected only by force of an external Fire, conjoined with
the inward Seminal Life.

Here you have the sum of all the Philosophers opinions couched in a few Words;
which none will be able to understand, but such to whom it shall please God to
reveal the same.

As to the first process of this Chapter, which is an Idea of the universal
Medicine of Paracelsus, and an clucidation of the Alltahest, the Artist is
desired to take notice, That we were not permitted to publish it naked to the
World, as it was in the Original German Manuscript; but Aenigmatically, it
being unlawful to cast Pearls before Swine: the Aenigma is couched under those
Words Printed in Old English Letter, and for the same I have fitted a Key, by
which the riddle may be easily unfolded. It was communicated to me, by 2
several person unknown to one another.

15. Aqua Cinnamomi Maxij, Cinnamon Water.

Cinnamon elect, only bruised jv. Bay Salt ij. Rhenish Wine or Sack, xxx.
digest some days; then put it into a Glass or Stone Cucurbit, place it in Sand,
with a Glass-head and Receiver, and distill, so will you have a delicate clear
Water, and very spirituous, which from time to time you must receive, and put
out of your Receiver, that it might not be mingled with the gross Phlegm, which
will ascend at last of a whitish color.

1. Now here is to be noted, That the Bay Salt is put into the Wine, that it
might the more powerfully open the Body of the Cinnamon, for it communicates to
the Water no peculiar Virtues. 2. That this Water is only the spirituous part
of the Wine, impregnated with the Volatile and Aromatic Salt of Cinnamon. 3.
That you ought not to distill in a Cucurbit of Glazed Earth, lest the sharpness
of the Cinnamon should so acuate the S.V. as to make it to corrode the Lead,
and thereby alter the Virtues of the Water, by impregnating it with those of
Saturn. 4. It is an excellent Cordial and Stomatick, revives the Spirits,
strengthens the whole Body, and facilitates the Delivery of Women in Childbed.
5. The more phlegmatic part of this Water may be of use to make Syrup of
Cinnamon withal, and indeed much more fit than common Water, because it
contains some small matter of the S.V. in it, and also of the Volatile Salt of
the Cinnamon, and so is fitter to open, penetrate and extract the Virtues of
fresh Cinnamon, than other common Water. 6. The Syrup is made by infusing new
Cinnamon herein, then straining, and dissolving in it a sufficient quantity of
Sugar, and so making it into a Syrup according to Art.

10. Aqua Fortis Paracelsi, The Silver dissolvent of Paracelsus.

Sal Niter, Vitriol, Alum, ana. the which distill into A.F. put this water again
upon its faeces, and again distill it in a Glass; This is for the purification
and dissolution of Silver; if you dissolve Sal Armoniack therein, it is for the
dissolution of Gold.

1. Take a Metal reduced into Leaves, and resolve it by these Waters into
Water, then separate it by B.M. pour it on again, repeat this so often till
there be found an Oil at the bottom, viz. of Sol or Gold, a spadicious or light
red color: Of Luna or Silver, an Azure: Of Mars a red and very obscure: Of
Mercury, a white: Of Saturn, a livid wan, and leady: Of Venus, an absolute
Green: Of Jupiter, a yellow color. 2. But yet note, That not all the Metals
are thus reduced into Oil, but such as have been before prepared: as for
example, Mercury is to be sublimed: Saturn, to be calcined: Jupiter, to be
reverberated, or sublimed: Mars, to be reduced to a Crocus: Venus, to be
reduced into Flowers. As for Sol and Luna, they will easily submit themselves.
3. The Metals being on this Wise reduced into a Liquid Substance; add
afterward to one part of this Oil, two parts of new or fresh Aqua fortis, and
being well shut in together in the best Glass, set it in Horse^dung for a
month, then distill it wholly off with a gentle Fire, that the matter may be
coagulated in the bottom; so if the Aq. fortis be distilled in B.M. then you
will find two Elements together; but all the Metals will not leave the same
Elements behind: for Sol in Balneo leaves Earth and Water behind: Luna in B.
the Elements of the Earth and Fire: Mercury, leaves the Fire behind, and the
Earth and Water are Elevated: Venus, leaves the Fire behind; and in a Balneo,
the Earth and Water abides: Saturn, leaves the Element of the Earth behind; and
in a Balneo the Fire and Water are to be had: Jupiter, leaves the Air behind,
and the Fire, Water, and Earth, are elevated therefrom. 4. It Is therefore to be
observed, That the Air affords a Body in Jupiter, and in no other Metal
whatsoever, of the which although some part does also ascend together, and
remains inseparably mixed with the other 3 Elements, yet notwithstanding that,
Air is not corporeal, but is adherent, and concurrent with the others, and is
inseparable from them. 5. Note also, That the remainder which is the Corporeal
Element, and remained in the bottom must be reduced in a Balneo into an Oil,
with fresh Aqua fortis, so will this Element be perfected, which keep for one
part. 6. The rest separate thus: put them in Sand, and urge them gently; so
first the Water will come forth, then the Fire, which you will know by the
color. If the ^arth and Water should have remained, the Water will ascend
first, then the Earth. But if the Earth and Fire remained, then the Earth is
elevated first, then the Fire. If the Water, Fire and Earth should be
together, the Water will a scend first, the Fire next, and lastly the Earth.
7. You are also to know thus much, that the corrosive nature of the Aqua
fortis, is to be extracted, as we have described it in the quintessences.
Paracelsi Archidox. lib. 2. de separatione Elementorum.

17. Aqua spiritus, and Oleum Nicotianae, Water, Spirit, and Oil of Tobacco.

Of the best Spanish Tobacco cut small viij. Phlegm of Vitriol as much, then
put them into a Glass Mattress, which cover with its Head: digest in Sand for a
day, fit to it a Receiver, and with a soft and small Fire, draw off about sive
ounces of Liquor, which keep in a Viol by it self; What remains, put into an
Earthen Retort, or a Glass one Luted, place it in a Furnace, and fit to it a
large Receiver, luting close the Juncture, begin with a small Fire so will the
Phlegm come first: augment it by little and little, and the Spirits will come
forth confusedly with a black Oil; continue the Fire till no more comes; let
the Vessels cool, and unlute them; separate the Oil from the Spirit, according
to Art. Or, you may cast all that is in the Recipient, into a filter of brown
Paper placed in a Glass Funnel, so will the watery and spirituous pass through,
while the black and foetid Oil remains behind. Out of the Caput Mortuum a sixth
Alkalious Salt may be drawn by Elixiviation, etc. but it will be small in
quantity, scarcely j. out of the viij. of Tobacco.

1. The first Water kept a part in a Viol is a powerful Emetick, and may be
given a ij ad vj. in some convenient Vehicle: outwardly, it kills the Itch,
Tettars, and Ring-worms, being gently rubbed with it. 2. The Spirit is of the
same Virtue, but ought to be given in a much smaller Dose. 3. The black saetid
Oil is so great an Emetick, that ones Nose being held over a little Viol of it
would cause Vomiting, ss of it may be mixed with j of Hogs Lard to anoint with
against Itch, Tettars, etc. Lemery says, That he made a small Incision in the
Skin of a Dogs Thigh, and thrusting in a small Tent dipped in this Oil, the Dog
immediately purged both upwards and downwards, with much Violence. 4. The fixed
Salt is Sudorifick, and may be given a gr. iv. ad x. in a proper Vehicle.

such like Water. It is much to be doubted whether the Recipe has not been
formerly false Transcribed, and so from thence false Printed; for most Artists
and Men of Understanding, think that in place of the Praecipitate, Corrosive
sublimate ought to be instituted.

You have a water of a most admirable use for all Eyes which are dim, dull,
cloudy, or have Cataracts breeding in them: you may at first bath the Eye lids
therewith, the Eyes being closed; but afterward you are to drop it into them
four or five times a day: some have received Cure from it, as if it had been
miraculous. This following comforts and restores the sight much, the Eyes being
often washed therewith. white Wine lbvij. new white Bread lbiiij. Cloves, Juice

M. for 30 or 40 days; then decant off the clear Liquor, to which add the said
Juice, Balsam and Musk aforesaid, digest again with a gentle heat for 10 days,
then keep it for use.

It is an admirable thing against the Plague, for which it was principally
designed, and against all manner of Pestilential Fevers. The Author says, the
older it is the better it is, and that it cures the Dropsy, being given every
morning ss. with Syrup of Roses solutive j. for 40 days together, the which he
proved. It heals and cures wounded and cut Veins, Nerves and Bones, if they be
dressed with this, and the parts be close joined and stayed together, it cures
in short time without alteration. It helps the White Scall, if you bath
herewith, as also coldness of the Head and Catarrhs, using it at night going to
bed: the Stomach bathed therewith is strengthened thereby, by which is caused
persect digestion: it also provokes Urine, and kills Worms. If you desire it of
a more Oily body, leave out the rectified S.V. and take so much Oil Olive and
old Hoggs Lard lbiss. and let your digestion and boiling be accordingly, which
seems to be according to the mind of the Author.

9. Spiritus Mellis Acidus, The Acid Spirit of Honey.

Honey lbj. Salt lbss. mix them, and distill Gradually by a Retort: there will
come first a white Water, then a yellow spirit and Oil, rectify them.

The white Water and yellow Spirit, cure the Pin and Web; cause Hair to grow,
and serve to extract the Tincture of Coral. Inwardly they open obstructions,
expel Urine, and break the Stone. The Oil if Circulated with perfectly
dephlegmated Spirit of Juniper Berries for some days, and then separated, it
cures the Gout, and is good against eating Ulcers, and Gunshot Wounds.

10. Spiritus Mellis Ardens, Inflamable Spirit of Honey.

Honey lbvj. Water lbxxiiij, dissolve the Honey in the Water, and with Yest,
Tartar or Leven, cause the liquor to ferment, after which in a Glass Alembick,
or Copper Vesica tin'd within, draw forth the spirit (in all respects) as you
draw forth the spirit of Wine, which if you please you may in the same manner
rectify.

The Virtues are the same with Spirit of Wine, but it is much more restorative:
it comforts the Heart, revives the Spirits, is good against Contagion, and
poisonous infections: you may put it to all uses to which you put S.V. and give
it inwardly in the same Dose. You may also use it as a Menstruum to make
Tinctures and Extracts withal, being much superior to many others, especially
if Tartariz'd, according to Art: if well drawn, you cannot discern it from the
best spirit of Wi^e.

11. Spiritus Vitrioli Epilepticus Fabri, Fabers Epilepticl Spirit of Vitriol.

Vitriol, purc Niter, anaput them into a well Luted Retort, and place them in a
fit surance, for distilling A.F. close the Joints of the Still and Receiver
well, to keep in the Spirit; draw off the A.F. and while the receiver is yet
red, with the spirits of the A.F. suddenly change it, and with great industry
join it to another Retort, half filled with Vitriol well dried and poudred:
Lute the Joints, and distill, as for spirit of Vitriol (for such it is) which
will arise in white Fumes, which spirit meeting in the Recipient with the A.F.
or red spirit of Niter, fix themselves with a great Noise, and as it were with
many Clouds slying about the void space of the Receiver, which at length
resolve into a blew and green water very heavy. Then let this water rest for
some days in its recipient close stopped, and digest it in a warm Balneo, to
putrify for a whole month; at last distill it per cineres with a very gentle
Fire, so have you in the first Distillation, the blew and green spirit of
Vitriol, falling down in blew and green drops; these ceasing, change the
Receiver, keeping this spirit in a Glass close stopped for use. What remains is
AF. which may be reserved for the cure of Fistula's and malign Ulcers, being 3
or 4 times rectified.

It is an Arcanum in the Epilepsy, performing the Cure sive per Sympathiam,
sive per idiopathiam. It wonderfully comforts and strengthens the Brain, takes
away from it super fluous humors, multiplies the Animal Spirits, augments the
Vital heat, and prevents the putrefaction of the Juyces through the whole body,
by virtue of its Volatility. It cures Freckles, spots of the skin, Herpes, and
all sorts of Scabs, only by Unction; as also Fistulated Ulcers, and that
without pain, because the Salt which resides in the Substance thereof is sweet,
without any Caustic or Burning property in it. Dose ad j. in a morning
fasting, for several days together (for a month at least) in Peony water, or in
Tincture of Peony Flowers, purging the body twice in the same month with Salt
of V^triol; by this means an absolute Cure of the Falling Sickness will be
completed. Here note, that if the before said rectified A.F. be joined with
S.V. and putrified together, there results therefrom an exce^lent Medicine to
open all Obstructions.

12. Spiritus Vitrioli Paracelsi, Paraceisus his Volatile Spirit of Vitriol.

Hungarian Vitriol deansed and dried, distill it by degrees in a Retort on a
^aked fire, that the Spirits may follow the Phlegm: to the distilled Liquor add
didilled Rain, and make a fresh list illation in B.M. then a subtle spirit of
Vitriol will be elevated with the water, and a sharp Oil left at bottom: but if
you would have the pure Volatile Spirit, after the Phlegm, take off the
Recerver, and whilst hot, place it in B. M. with a well luted Alembick, and a
small Receiver, so have you a Volatile Spirit, which keep by its self; you will
get but j. out of lbij.

Paracelsus commends this as a perfect cure for the Falling-S^ckness, the which
thing some have proved; but the dearness of the Medicine prohibits the common
use thereof. Mixed with Rainwater, it is very piercing, and very excellent in
the worst of Fevers. Take so much at a time as may make the Vehicle a little
sharp.

13. Spiritus se^ Oleum Salis, Spirit or Oil of Salt.

Common Salt lbij. make it into paste with Potters Clay, Sand or Bole, lbiij.
or more; dry them hard, then put them into a Glass Retort luted, and not half
filled; fix it to a large Receiver, and keep an equal degree of Fire, till the
Phlegm is gone; then force it with a strong Fire, continuing till a white spirit
comes forth; rectify it, and abstract or evaporate the Phlegm.

It cures the Scurvy and Surfeits, resists the putrefaction of Fevers,
quenches Thirst, breaks, dissolves and expells the Stone in both Reins and
Bladder; dissolves all Tartarous Substances, opens Obstructions, and is
prevalent against the Plague. Dose a gut. viij. ad xij. or more.

14. Spiritus de Cornu Cervi, Spirit of Hartshorn.

Hartshorn rasped, put it into an Earthen Retort, or a Glass one coated; set
it in an open Fire with a large Receiver, and make the Fire by degrees, so have
you a yellow Spirit, with a Volatile red Oil (change the Receiver when the red
Oil comes) then rectify the Spirit with Calcined Tartar.

The rectified Spirit is very penetrating, and opens all Obstructions in the
whole body; it purges by Sweat and Urine all malign humors and vapors, it is
powerful against the Plague, and all sorts of Fevers; as also the Smallpox,
Measles, French Pox, Scurvy, Jaundice, Surfeits, Pleurify, Melancholy, Leprosy
and Gout. The red Oil rectified, cures Quartan Agues, Wounds, Bruises, and all
pains coming of Cold, Both Spirit and Oil are excellent against all sorts of
Fits, the Suffocation of the Womb Apoplexies, Convulsions, Palsies, Vertigoes,
Epilepsies, etc. Dose of the Spirit a gut. xv. ad xxx. of the Oil a gut. vj. ad
x.

15. Spiritus and Oleum Cranij humani compositus, Spirit and Oil of Man's Skull
compound.

shavings of a man's skull that was killed viij. Amber in powder vj. shavings of
Ox-horns iv. mix them, and in a glass Retort, with its Recipient, distill in a
sandheat with a gradual Fire, so have you a spirit mixed with Oil, Phlegm and
Volatile salt, to which add the fixed salt of the faeces. Here note, that some
make it without the Addition of Ox-horns.

This is accounted one of the greatest Secrets in Nature for the cure of the
Falling sickness, being given two or three times in a month, in the morning
fasting, in some Cephalic water, anointing the Sutures of the Skull, Temples
and inside of the Nostrils therewith. Dose gut. vij.

16. Spiritus Rosmarini compositus, compound Spirit of Rosemary.

dried Rosemary M. vj. Lavender, sweet Marjoram, Sage, Bawm, Tile flowers, A.
M. iij. Saffron, Cloves bruised, A. ij ss. Queen of Hungaries water lbviij.
digest all 10 days, then separate the spirit in B. M. according to Art.

This is a great Cephalic, good against Head-achs, Megrims, Apoplexies,
Epilepsies, Palsies, Numbness, Lameness, Lethargies, and other Diseases of the
Brain and Nerves. Dose ij. or more in a Glass of Wine.

17. Spiritus Carminativus Sylvij, Sylvius his Spirit expelling Wind.

Angelica roots j. Masterwort, Galangal roots, A. iss. Rosemary, sweet
Marjoram, Garden. Rue, Basilleaves, A. M ss. Bay Berries iij. Angelica, Lovage,
Aniseeds, A. ss. Ginger, Nutmegs, Mace, A. jss. Cinnamon vj. Cloves, Orange
Peel, A. j. beat all grossly, and put upon them spirit of Mallaga Wine or
Canary xl. digest two days in B. M. and distill to dryness; whatsoever ascends,
let be poured upon the Mass; digest two days, and then distill three fourth
parts, keeping the spirit for use. If you please, you may put upon the
remaining, S. V. rectified xx. digest two days, then distill as long as a strong
spirit will come over, which (as weaker in Virtue) keep a part from the former.

It is an admirable thing against the Chollick, and all oppressions of Wind,
weakness of the Stomach, obstructions of the Spleen, Fainting and Swooning
Fits, Plague, Pestilence and Poison: it also prevails against Gravel and Stone,
and may be given in some proper Water, a iij. ad vj.

18. Spiritus Vini Philosophicus Kirkringij, Philosophic Spirit of Wine.

Sal Armoniack thrice sublimed iiij. Spirit of Wine distilled from Salt of
Tartar, so as it may be perfectly dephlegmated, a sufficient quantity: put them
together in a Vial, which digest in a very gentle heat, that the S. V. may
fully imbibe the Sulphur or Fire of the Sal Armoniack; then distill the mixture
thrice by an Alembick, so have you a most excellent Menstruum.

The use of this is to extract a blood-red Tincture from the Glass of Antimony,
and from other mineral and metalick bodies. It is not much unlike to that of
Basil Valentinus, mentioned in Our Pharm. Land. Lib. 1. Cap 9. Sect. 22. having
indeed all those virtues. They that please to use this in all inward
Obstructions, will it may be give me thanks for communicating the Secret use of
this most excellent Spirit; but I may say no more. Give some drops.

19. Spiritus Veneris seu Cupri Zwelferi, Spirit of Venus or Copper.

Of the Volatile Vitriol of Venus, (made of Verdigrise of Montpellier, as is
taught in cap. 10. sect. 13.) q. s. powder it in a Marble Mortar, put it into a
Retort with a long neck and wide mouth, after which cleanse the whole neck of
the Retort, with a seather tied to a stick, that none of the Vitriol may cleave
to it. Place this Retort in a close Reveaberatory furnace, having four
Registers on its corners and one in its middle, that thereby you may the better
govern the fire. To the neck of the Retort fit a capacious and large glass
Receiver, clean and dry; stop the juncture with a wet Bladder, which Lute with
Quicklime and whites of Eggs. When the Lute is dry begin to give fire very
slowly, that the vapors may arise softly and by degrees, which condensing
themselves into the neck of the Retort, may fall by clear and limpid drops into
the Receiver. Now the mouth of the Retort ought to enter into the Receiver
about four Inches, that the diversity of the Color of the distilling drops may
be seen (which is pleasant to behold) whereby the Fire may be the better
regulated, which in this Operation is of great importance; for if the fire be
never so little too great it may break the Vessels. This degree of heat is to
be kept so long as the drops fall clear, and the true degree of the fire may be
known by the space of time between the falling of each drop, which is while you
may number six or seven. When the drops begin to turn green, and the white
vapors appear in the Receiver, condensing themselves into a Spirit, which makes
in the glass, strokes like winding Veins, it shows that the Volatile spirit
manifests it self largely, and that you ought to proceed very leisurely,
because the Receiver will grow very hot, by the heat of the vapors and
spirits. The first clear drops last nearly about five hours; the green and
first volatile vapors, as much. This being over increase the fire, till the
Receiver is filled with very white vapors, which will continue (the fire being
continually augmented) for five or six hours. Toward the end, by the great and
vehement force of the fire, yellow drops will fall, which by degrees will
become red, and is an absolute sign of the completing or finishing of the
Operation, which lasts about twelve or fifteen hours, according to the lesser
or greater quantity of the matter. Let the fire go out, and the Vessels being
cold, unlute them and put the yellowish spirit (having a strong sulphurous
smell) into a Cucurbit, which place in B.M. lute to it a Still-head, and to its
nose or beak a Mattress; give a gentle and fit fire to it, for this spirit rises
as easily as does S. V. but toward the end increase the fire a little more,
that the whole substance may ascend in a most volatile and penetrative spirit,
leaving a few Faeces at bottom.

It is an admirable thing against the Falling Sickness, Apoplexy, Vertigo, and
other Diseases of the Brain; against fits of the Mother and all Hypocondriack
and Melancholy Diseases, the radicated Scurvy, Surfeits, and all inveterate
pains of the Head. Dose a gut. j. ad x. or to a pleasant acidity, in any proper
vehicle. This is truly the greatest remedy that can be extracted from Copper,
which Zwelfer, the Inventer hereof has commended in these Words: Et ut summatim
dicam tanquam expertus in multis affectibus, qui Herculea etiam remedia rident,
and contemnunt, ad hunc spiritum tanquam Asylum si quis accurrcret,
medicamentum reperiet quovis, precio redimendum; Hoc fruere lector Amice
secreto, and favore mei, pro fideli communicatione benevole persevera. This is
not only a remedy in Physic, but a most famous dissolvent in Alchymy, and a
preparer of other Medicaments, opening and dissolving their bodies without
corrosion, without altering their seminal and i^erpetick powers and faculties.
It dissolves Metals, Minerals and Stones, after which it may be drawn off by
Distillation, without any loss of its strength and vigor, and serve again, and
continually to the same uses, retaining to the last its first or radicated
power, both as to Physic and Alchymy.

20. Spiritus Cochleariae Compositus, Spirit of Scurvygrass Compound.

Scurvy Grass cut small lbxviij. Scurvy Grass seeds bruised lbvj. Horse radish
roots thin sliced lbiiij. Mustard seed burised lbij. put all into a Copper
Alembick or Vesica tinned within, upon which put so much good Rhenish Wine, as
the things may easily swim in it: cover the Still with its head, fix its
receiver, and lute the joints well: give fire as if you were stilling S. V. and
be always mindful that the water of the Refrigeratory be always fresh and cold,
changing it as it becoms hot. Keep the first and strong spirit by it it self,
changing the receiver when you perceive the Liquor to change its taste, and grow
weaker. The receiver being changed, continue the fire till you find the drops
almost insipid; this last water keep also by it self.

The first Spirit is very strong, and may be given a gut. x. ad xl. It purifies
the whole mass of blood by sweat, insensible Transpiration, and Urine,
penetrating into the last digestion, and entering into the most Capillary Veins,
Arteries and Lymphaducts, to draw out and correct all sharp and scorbutic
humors, wandering and nocturnal pains. It is an an admirable remedy in a cold
Scorbute, and many other cold Diseases, as Palsies, Dead Palsies, Apoplexies,
Lethargies, etc. but of dangerous consequence in a scorbute, where the
constitution is hot and dry, for there it mightily excites the symptoms, and
makes the Disease rage worse and worse, instead of Curing.

The latter water is of the same virtue with the former, but ought to be given
in a greater Dose, however it may well serve in other distillations.

21. Spiritus Salis Armoniaci Acidus; The sour Spirit of Salt Armoniack.

The Caput Mort. or fixed mass left at the bottom of the Cucurbit, after the
distillation of the spirit of Sal Armoniack, laid down in our Pharmacopoeia,
lib. 3. cap. 11. sect. 32. powder it, and mix it with thrice as much Potters
Earth in powder, put all into a Retort, so big as a third part may remain
empty: put it into a close reverberatory Furnace, and fit to it a very
capacious receiver, Lute the junctures, and proceed in all respects as with
spirit of salt, at sect. 13. aforegoing, so will you have in the Receiver the
acid spirit of Sal Armoniack.

It has the Virtues of Oil and Spirit of Salt; it is a good Diuretic, and a
specific against Fevers and Malignant Diseases. Dose so much as may make the
vehicle so sharp as it may be conveniently drunk. The said Caput Mortuum is the
sixth Salt of the Sal Armoniack, mixed with the salt of Tartar; but this spirit
is the spirit of the said sixth salt, not of the Salt of Tartar.

22. Spiritus, Oleum, and Sal Volatile Vrinae, Spirit, Oil and Volatile Salt of
Urine.

Urine of sound young men newly made lbxxiiij. evaporate the humidity in an
earthen or glass curcurbit, in a sand heat, till it is of the thickness of
Honey, then fit to it a Head with its Receiver, and luting the joints close,
continue a gentle fire, till the rest of the Phlegm is drawn off; after which
increase the fire by degrees, and the spirit will rise up in clouds, carrying
along with it the Oil (which will be but little) and after that the Volatile
Salt, which will stick to the Head, as it were in slakes: continue the fire
till no more ascends, then unlute the Vessels, and separating the Volatile
Salt, put it into a Mattress or Bolt Head, with a long Neck; pour into it also
the Spirit which is in the Receiver, and fit a blind head to the Mattress; lute
the joints with a wet Bladder, and setting the Bolt Head in Sand, sublime with
a small fire all the Volatile Salt (as I have showed in my Pharmacopoeia, lib.
2. cap. 5. sect. 24. 12. in the sublimation of the Salt of Vipers.) Take this
Salt and keep it in a Vial close stopped. The remaining spirit you may either
draw off with a gentle heat, or, filter it through Paper; so will there remain
behind a small quantity of black and very stinking Oil.

1. The Salt is excellent against Quartane Agues, and Malign Fevers; it opens
Obstructions, and works both by sweat and urine. Dose a gr. vj. ad xvj. in any
proper Vehicle. 2. The Spirit has the same Virtues with the Salt, and may be
given a gut. viij, ad xx. in some fit Liquor. 3. The Oil is of use to be given
to women troubled with fits of the Mother, and to discuss cold Tumors. 4. If of
the Spirit j. be mixed with S. V. j. the mixtion will be powerful against cold
pains, the Sciatica and Palsy. 5. If the Caput Mortuum be calcined, you may
extract a very small quanty of the fixed salt the common way. 6. The Urine of
young men is chosen because that contains most Salt; and it is taken while it
is new and fresh, and evaporated over a gentle heat, that the Volatile Salts
may not arise with the Phlegm. 7. The Spirit of Urine, as also the Spirits of
Hartshorn, of Amber, and other like Spirits, are improperly called Spirits;
because Spirits are sulphurous and inflamable, whereas these Spirits so called,
are only Phlegm impregnated with some part of the Volatile Salt. 8. These
Spirits and Salt of Urine ought not to be given in any warm thing, because the
heat thereof would make some part of the Volatile Salt to vanish, before it
could be taken. 9. Another way to draw the Salt of Urine. Set the Urine some
months in fermenting in a vessel close stopped; from this distill a third part;
this distilled liquor rectify three or four times in an Alembick, casting away
in each distillation the Phlegm that remains at the bottom of the Bolt-head:
lastly, put this Spirit of Urine into a Mattress with its head, and sublime the
Volatile Salt as before. This Salt is thought to be more penetrating, but it is
much more tedious to make than the former.

of the Air. Bathed with outwardly, it is of excellent use against the Cramp,
and all cold affects of the Nerves. But indeed this Spirit sar surpasses all
that which here we have said; for it penetrates almost in a moment the whole

taken never so little of it shall have the first Urine which comes from him,
after taking of it, to have the smell of Orrice-root, Rasp-berries or Violets.

CHAP. III. Of OILS Distilled.
1. OLEVM Cinnamomi, Oil of Cinnamon.

Cinnamon, grossly bruise it, put it into a glass Body, which cover with spirit
of Wine (made very sharp with spirit of Salt, or else having so much Salt put
into it as the Wine will dissolve:) put thereto a blind Head, which Lute close,
and set it to digest in a gentle heat, for about ten days: then apply an
Alembick close luted, with its receiver; distill it with a small Fire,
increasing it by degrees; so shall you have a heavy Oil which will sink, and a
Spirit: separate them, and keep them for use. Or thus, choice Cinnamon bruised
lbvj. Rainwater lbxviij. Sal Niter xij. digest in an Earthen Vessel well stopped
for 48 hours: put the Ingredients into a large Copper Alembick, well tin'd
within, join to it a fit receiver, luting the joints with a wet Bladder, distill
with a pretty good sire, lbiij or lbiiij. of the Liquor: then unlute the
Stillatory, and pour into the Alembick the distilled Water by inclination,
reserving the Oil, which will be at the bottom of the Receiver, stopping it up
close in a little Vial by it self: Distill the Liquor again as before, returning
the distilled Liquor again, and reserving the Oil with the former: This
Cohobation so often repeat, till no more Oil will arise: then weaken the fire,
and draw off a strong Cinnamon Water, which rectify as you do Spirit of Wine.

1. The Virtues of this Oil are almost infinite, in comforting, strengthening,
and restoring of Nature, fortifying the Stomach, corroborating the Heart, etc.
And the spirituous Water is of the same nature, but weaker: See the Virtues at
large, in Our Pharmacop. lib. 4. cap. 3. sect. 12. Where you have also the way
of Exhibition. 2. After this manner almost all Oils of Odoriferous Vegitables
may be drawn, as those of Roses, Sweet-Marjoram, Jamaica Pepper, Cloves, Mace,
Nutmegs, Aniseeds, Dill-seeds, Rosemary, Lavender, Juniper, Sassasrass,
Rhodium, etc. Which either swim above the Water or sink, according as they are
less or more repleat with Salts. 3. The Niter is put into the digestion, that
the water may the more powerfully open the body of the matter, that it may the
more easily exert and yield its Oil. 4. The Cohobation serves only for the
farther opening of the body, to make a perfect separation of the Oil, which
without it could not be. 5. You ought to make a sufficiently strong fire,
otherwise the Oil will not rise at all. 6. Cinnamon yields less Oil than other
Woods or Barks: one pound scarcely yielding above j. of good Oil. 7. The Spirit
of Cinnamon is only a rarefied Oil, whose parts are separated and divided in
the Water by Fermentation, so as to become imperceptible.

(and together with the powder of the Frogs mingled, for the making of a
Liniment.)

This eases all manner of Pains in any part of the body, chiefly of the Gout;

20. Oleum foetidum Juniperi, Stinking Oil of Juniper.

Juniper Berries which have already yielded their Aromatic Oil, fill with them
a Stone or Glass Retort luted, put it into a heat of Sand or Ashes in a small
Reverberatory Furnace, so will many white Vapors come forth, which in the
Receiver will condense themselves, some into an acid Spirit, and some into a
black, stinking and Caustic Oil: xvj of Berries will yield ij. of Oil, and
xij. of this Acid Spirit: if you use fresh Berries, whose Aromatic Oil is not
yet extracted, the stinking Oil will be double in quantity: separate by a glass
Funnel the Oil from the Acid Spirit.

It is of singular use for the Spina Ventosa, or the Gangreen and rot of the
Bones, for all old Ulcers, Ring-worms and the Toothach; if the Tooth be hollow,
dip a little Cotton therein, and stop the Tooth therewith. See my Pharm. lib.
4. cap. 3. sect. 24.

filling it up to the Neck: put it into an Ash Furnace, fit to it a Receiver,
and give Fire by degrees, so will you have a white, dark vapor, which will
continue all the time of the Operation. The Phlegm comes first; then Tartar
takes Fire and flames in the Retort; from the smoke of this Flame comes the
Spirit and Oil: continue the Fire tiil the Receiver is clear and cold, though a
strong Fire be under the Retort: lastly, separate the Spirit from the Oil
according to Art.

1. The Oil is stinking and Caustic, is good in a Spina Ventosa, for it
exfoliates Bones. The Acid Spirit being rectified is good against the Gravel
and Stone. 2. By this Work it is apparent that Tartar is a very Sulphurous
Salt, for that it takes Fire in the Retort, and yields a black, stinking and
inflamable Oil. 3. One pound of Tartar will yield about x. of Spirit with its
F^egm; ij. of Oil, and iiij. of black Faeces in the Retort. 4. These black
Faeces being dissolved in Water, filterated and coagulated, yield above iij. of
most pure Salt of Tartar. See my Pharmacop^eia, lib. 4. cap. 3. sect. 41.

CHAP. IV. Of BALSAMS Distilled.
1. BA^samum a Mesue, A Balsam invented by Mesue.

ss. Turpentine iiij ss. let the dry Gums be beaten, Macerated and dissolved as
much as may be in Wine, then mixed all together with the Turpentine: this whole
mixture is to be put into an Alembick: distill at first with a gentle fire, and
then increase it by degrees, so will you have first a thin Liquor, then a
thick, reddish, yellowish Balsam: and from the Colophony by a Retort, a red
Balsam.

Now here is to be noted, 1. That the Balsam will be so much the better if you
put in Burgundy Pitch instead of the Gum Arabic. 2. That the Mosch will be
much better, to be reduced in a subtle powder, and then mixed with the yellow
Balsam, because that so great a heat as is required to the distill^^ion hereof
will much alter it, both in virtue and scent. 3. That both the yellowish Balsam
and the Red, distilled by a retort, are both of one nature, save that the first
is the most pleasant both for color, smell and consistency, and has the
greatest volatillity in it. 4. It is highly Celebrated for all affects of the
Nerves, mightily strengthens them. It takes away the coldness of any part, and
excites and comforts the native heat, adding strength to the same; being
anointed upon the Back bone, it cur^s the Palsy, and helps Cramps and
Convulsions, being applied to the place. It cures such as are taken Dum^, if a
little of it be put into the Ears, put up the Nostrils, and held under the
Tongue. Vocatur hoc Balsamum a Petro Apponensi Medicamentum omnium
Medicamentorum in celeri cordis roboratione and virium restitutione.

with a gentle fire, first a white and clear water will come over, secondly a
yellow Oil, thirdly, a Saffron-colored Balsam, which is the thing desired.

It will be better in the distillation, that the Camphir and Ambergrise be so
contrived that they may hang in the Beak of the Alembick, for by that means the
Water, Oil and Balsam, will smell much more pleasant and strong. The Water
comforts the internal parts, expels Wind, and is good against Fits of the

pure and subtle substance, and may be given in any fit vehicle, in all cold and
moist Diseases of the Head. The Balsam is a most perfect Cure for all wounds

part affected.

CHAP. V. Of POWERS.
I. BEfore we enter upon the describing of particular Recipe's, we think it
necessary to tell you what the Potestates or Powers of Medicaments are: And
these we delare to be the Essential, Subtle, and Etherial part of any mixed
Body, freed from all its terresterity or filth, and exalted to the highest
degree of Purity; in that the whole and entire Essence or Being, with all the
Powers of any simple Body, as Salt, Oil and Spirit, are not only perfectly
elucidated, but keep completed united in one similar, or simple and
congenerous substance or body. II. These are indeed the true Essences of those
things from whence they are drawn, which Essence is enough known (to the
studious in Nature) to be envolved, not in any one of the principles alone, but
in all the three, viz. the Salt, Oil and Spirit equally. III. To this kind of
Medicaments, the Ancients gave the name of Quintessence, but very improperly;
forasmuch as things are so far from having a fifth Essence or Being, that the
wisest of Mortals have not yet found out a second; unless they will attribute
it to the form and state of their Being: which if so, it is but the first, Ens,
Essence or Property, appearing in a new, more glorious and illustrious state,
condition, form or appearance, wherein it is made free from all its bondage,
filth, corruption, putrefaction, and decaying properties. IV. And this first
Ens, Essence or Being, which is constituted of the Salt, Oil and Spirit (in
which all the forces or powers of the whole, are concentrated) being made one
pure, simple, and united substance, is that which we call the Potestates or
Powers of Medicines, because therein all their Powers are included; but others
call them Essences and Quintessences. V. Now that we might not confound things,
we shall deliver first the Potestates or Powers of simple Vegetables by
themselves; afterward the Quintessences and Essences of diverse learned men,
wherein although we shall impose the name of Powers upon all the first
institution; yet we shall not alter the Appellations of those other things, but
retain them under the names and sense of their Authors.

1. Potestates Absinthii, The Powers of Wormwood.

The Powers of Wormwood are made as the Quintessence of Mint, in Our Pharmacop.
Londinens. Lib. 4. Cap. 5. Sect. 32. to which we refer you.

The Virtues of the Powers of Wormwood are many, the constant use thereof
preserves Health to old Age: It strengthens and fortifies the Stomach to a
Miracle, and stops Vomiting, when no other thing in nature will do it. It
causes a good Appetite, strong Digestion: opening all Obstruction of the
Ventricle: and by reason of the affinity the Stomach has with the Brain,
because of the Nerves proceeding from the par vagum, and some other Vessels, it
strengthens all the other parts of the Head and Brain, and in opposition to an
old Woman's Fable, preserves the sight entire to the height of old Age. It
strengthens the Liver and Spleen, corrects all cold and moist intemperatures of
the whole Body, and is of excellent use in Dropsies of all sorts. Dose morning,
noon and night a gut. xx. ad xxx. in a glass of choice Canary.

2. Potestates Angelicae, The Powers of Angelica.

They are made like the Powers of Wormwood.

Its a mighty great Cordial, Alexipharmick and Counter-poyson; it resists and
roots out the essence of all Poisons, chiefly those of the Plague and
Pestilential Diseases: comforts the Heart in all manner of Fevers, corrects
and destroys the poison and venom of their malignity. Its good in fainting and
swoonings, in all manner of illness of the Stomach, prevails against
Palpitation of the Heart and Trembling; gives ease in the Chollick, expels Wind
powerfully, chears the Heart, revives the Spirits Natural, Vital and Animal;
gives comfort and strength to the whole universal man: Its of known use against
the bitings of mad Dogs, Serpents, and all other venomous Creatures. It expels
Melancholy, strengthens the Brain; takes away Elusions and Phantasms of the
mind; is good against all putrid and intermitting Fevers whatsoever. Dose ad
i. or more in good Canary.

3. Potestates Gummi Ammoniaci, The Powers of Gum Ammoniack.

They are made as is that of Myrrh, in Our Pharmac. Londinensis. Lib. 4. Cap.
5. Sect. 30.

Given inwardly in Wine, it opens all Obstructions of Liver, Spleen and
Mesentery: it dissolves hard and Scirrhus Tumors of those parts, removes all
stubborn viscosities of the Lungs: Its a kind of pectoral, especially if it be
given with Spirit of Sal Armoniack, for thereby it opens Obstructions with so
mighty a power, that scarcely any Discase proceeding from them can withstand
its force. Its good for such as are in Travel, facilitating both Birth and
Afterbirth: It is commended to all Splenetick persons, as a Jewel. Outwardly
bathing therewith it mollifies and dissolves all hard knobs, and gummossities
upon the joints of the Fingers, Toes and other parts. Inwardly it may be taken
from gut. xij. ad xx. or more in Wine. It may also be given in fits of the
Mother, a. ad ij. Some say this Medicine is a Specific in the Kings Evil,
being used outwardly and inwardly.

4 Potestates Anethi, Powers of Dill.

They are made as the Quintessence of Aniseeds, in Our Pharmacopoeia
Londinensis: Lib. 4. Cap. 5. Sect. 3.

They expel Wind, comfort the Stomach, ease pains of the sides and Bowels, are
prevalent against the Chollick, and powerfully stop Vomiting: They are good to
dissolve and expel the Stone and Gravel, open Obstructions of the Reins and
Bladder, and force away Urine: they are also good against Obstructions of the
Spleen, take away its hardness, and ease pains thereof: They comfort all places
and parts afflicted with Diseases proceeding from a cold and moist habit of
body, whether inwardly given, or ouwardly applied. Dose a j. ad ij. in any fit
Vehicle.

5. Potestates Baccarum Juniperi, Powers of Juniper Berries.

They are made as the Powers of Aniseeds and Winter-Cherries, mentioned in Our
Pharmacopoeia Londinensis, Lib. 4. Cap. 5. Sect. 3.22.

Powers of Juniper Berries are of admirable use in the Stone and Gravel, easing
all manner of pains, and opening all manner of Obstructions in the Reins,
Ureters and Bladder, are prevalent against the Chollick, and all Diseases
proceeding from Wind in the Bowels. They ease an afflicted Stomach, comfort all
the Viscera, remove all the Stoppages of the Liver and Spleen: I have known the
use hereof to cure a Scirrhus of the Liver (one that might outwardly be felt,
of an eminent largeness) after other Medicines had been long used in vain: many
learned Physicians have found by experience, that they cure the Scurvy; and I
know by my own experience, that they cure Asthma's, Coughs, difficulty of
Breathing, shortness of Breath, and other the like cold and moist Diseases of
the Lungs. Outwardly being bathed therewith they help coldness of the Limbs,
Numbness, Palsies, and the Cramp, though never so violent. Dose taken inwardly
a gut. xx. ad xxx. in Canary, or Rhenish Wine.

6. Potestates Baccarum Lauri, Powers of Bay Berries.

They are made as the Powers of Juniper Berries, save by reason of their
dryness, you must facilitate the Formentation, by the addition of Rhenish Wine,
then proceed in all respects as if they were Juniper Berries.

These have all the Virtues of the former, and in the Opinion of the most
Learned men, much transcends in strength all the Opperations of
Juniper Berries: moreover these are an admirable Cephalic and Hysteric, they
cure old Diseases of the Brain, as old Colds, pituitous Head-Achs, Appoplexies,
Epilepsies, Megrims, Palsies, Carus, Lethargy, Convulsions, etc. Outwardly you
may bathe the Head therewith, or any other cold part affected therewith. It is
prevalent against all cold Gouts and Rheumatisms. Its a singular expedient
against the Wind Chollick; and some say, in that respect out-does all other
Medicamonts. It cures all Fits of the Mother, all manner of vapors and
strangulation of the Womb: it cleanses, warms and comforts that part. It
causes Fruitfulness, and takes away the worst of Barrenness, whether in Men or
Women, according as the Cause may be. Dose a gut. xv. ad xxv. in choice Wine.

7. Potestates Chamaemillae, Powers of Camomil.

They are made as those of Angelica, Wormwood and Mint.

Their Virtues are transcendent in easing all manner of Pains of the Head,
Stomach, Belly and extreme parts. They are good against fainting and swooning
Fits, weakness of Stomach, and loss of Appetite, and therefore they are for the
most part mixed with those things which warm and comfort the Stomach, and
strengthen the digestive Faculty. They cure all cold Diseases of the Head, but
of the Womb more especially: they provoke Urine, and are said to expel the
Stone and Gravel; by some they are esteemed a specific in the Cure of Agues of
all sorts, and for that cause sake, the Egyptians dedicated the Herb to the
Sun. It Is prevalent against Fits of the Mother, and Vapors ascending from the
Womb, and other cold passions and affects of that part. Dose a gut. xx. ad xxx.
in any convenient Liquor.

8. Potestates Cranij Humani, Powers of Man's Skull.

They may be made as the Quintessence of Hartshorn, mentioned in Our
Dispensatory, Lib. 4. Cap. 5. Sect. 16. if you design it as an Antidote against
Plague and Poison: but if against Diseases of the Head, as the Epilepsy, etc.
as you make the Quintessence of Elks-hoofs, mentioned in the Book aforecited.
Lib. 4. Cap. 5. Sect. 47. Or, as you make the Quintessence of a Deers-head,
hereafter in this Chapter declared. Or, as the Quintessence of Man's Bones, at
Sect. 44. following.

The great intention of this Medicament is to cure the Epilepsia, or Falling
Sickness, whether in old or young, for which without doubt it is an excellent
thing; it cures most other Diseases of the Head proceeding from cold, and
moisture, as Apoplexies, Coma, Carus, Lethargy, Palsies, etc. It may be given
to Children agut.j. or ij. ad jv. or vj. according to Age and Strength, but to
such as are grown to Men and Women's estate a gut. xvj. ad xxx. or more, it may
be given in blackcherry or Tile flower-waters, or in water of Lilly Convally,
or Peony Water; let it be taken in the morning fasting, or if it may be rather
before day; and last at night going to Bed, and to be continued for a Month;
afterward upon the intermission of the Fits, you may only give it about the
Full and Change; and lastly once a quarter.

9. Potestates Carui, Powers of Carraway-seeds.

They are made as Powers of Aniseeds and Dill aforegoing.

This Medicine is a powerful Carminative or expeller of Wind, and commonly
gives present ease in the most intolerable Cholick: it opens all Obstructions
of the Reins and Ureters, provokes Urine, expels the Stone and Gravel, and
warms and comforts a weak and enfeebled Stomach. It opens Obstructions of the
Womb, and causes a cleansing of those parts; it also sacilitates the bringing
away the Birth and Afterbirth, and remits the after pains, inwardly given and
outwardly applied to the part pained: Dose a j, ad ss. or more in Rhenish Wine
or Canary.

10. Potestates Cymini, Powers of Cummin-seeds.

They are made as are those of Anise, Dill and Carraways.

They are Cephalic, Pectoral, and Carminative, are good against Coughs, Colds,
Ulcers in the Lungs, Asthma's, shortness of Breath, stinking Breath,
Pleurisies, Stitches, pains of the Stomach and Sides: They at, tennuate thick
and gross humors, digest crudities, and dissolve swellings. They are profitable
against the Headache, Megrim, Vertigo, etc. Open Obstructions in the Stomach,
Belly, Reins, Ureters and Womb, and may be given a gut. xvj. ad xxx. in a glass
of Rhenish Wine.

11. Potestates ex Corticibus Citri, Powers of Citron Peels.

They are made as the Powers of Orange and Limon-Peels.

They are Cephalic, Cordial and Hysteric, comfort a weak Head and Womb, and
are profitably given in all cold Diseases of those parts; moreover they resist
Poison, and prevail mightily against the Plague and all other Malign and
Pestilential Diseases, given in proper Vehicles, according to Age and Strength.
They are also beneficial against the bitings of Serpents, Mad-dogs, and other
venomous Beasts; they revive the Spirits, refresh weakened and decayed Nature,
and comfort all the parts of man's Body, from Head to Foot. Dose a gut. xx. ad
xxx. in a fit Vehicle.

12. Potestates Faeniculi sem. Powers of Fennel-seeds.

They are made as those of Anise, Dill, Caraways and Cummin.

This Medicament is an excellent Pectoral and Carminative, and is mighty
prevalent against all Diseases of the Breast and Lungs, for it opens
obstructions powerfully, and almost insensibly Dissolves all cold coagulations
of those parts, it sweetens the sharpness of Humors, is profitable in a
Catarrh, and in the most vehement Coughs, Wheezings, Shortness of Breath, and
other stoppages of those parts. It has been found by Experience to be good
against Pleurifies, pain and stitches of the Side, the Cholick, and all windy
Eruptions in any part of the body: Moreover in After-pains there is not many
better things: It is good in all Gripings, Fluxes, bloody-Fluxes, Lienteria's
and Diseases and weaknesses of the Bowels proceeding from wind, cold or any
sharp and corrosive humor: It is also an admirable thing to be given after
violent purging, because it pleasantly (as it were) heals the Bowels: moreover,
if mixed with any purge it makes it work without griping: and where any purge
works too much, it restrains it, and hinders its virulency: the powers of these
Seeds are indeed inferior to few Medicaments, and do much in some of these
cases transcend those of Annise, Cumin or Carawayes: you may use them outwardly
to any Ach, pain, lameness or humbness proceeding from Cold, by bathing the
place therewith: and inwardly you may give them in choice Canary, from gut. xx
to ij or j, as often as need requires.

13. Potestates Guajaci, Powers of Guajacum.

This Medicine is made as the Powers of other simples by a conjunction of the
Salt, oil and spirit, freed from all filth and terrestreous matter.

The Virtues are the same with that of the wood, save the Powers act more
freely subtly and effectually, and so consequently more speedily; They are
reported perfectly to cure the Pox, and all its attendants alone; however it is
certain they will do whatever the wood can do in decoction or otherwise:
because here you have the wood resolved, and the Powers and Essential Virtues
only separated and freed from those heavy chains and bands of Corporiety, with
which formerly they were clogged: you may give from gut. x. to xx. xxx. or
more, as the Patient can bear it, in small Ale, and that as often as the
Patient drinks it. But because it is a very hot and drying Medicament, you
ought to be cautious to whom you use it, especially for any time, lest it
brings upon them an Incurable Consumption, for it dryes excessively, and ought
to be used chiefly in cold, moist, watery, slegmatick, and hydropick Bodies, in
whom it may prove a medicament of admirable Success. It is also good in all
cold and moist Catarrhs; but the prudent Physician ought to beware that he
gives it not too long, but rather by Internals, lest thereby he should over-dry
the internal Viscera, and thereby commit an Error not to be amended.

14. Potestates Limonium, Powers of Lemmons.

They are made as are those of Orange and Citron-Peels.

This Medicine is an admirable Cephalic and Cordial, in so much that it has
very few equals in the whole Art of Medicine: it strengthens the Brain in all
its saculties, comforts and warms it: It is prevalent against the Headache and
Megrim from a cold Cause; as also against the Lethargy, Carus, Apoplexy,
Epilepsy, Palsy, and all cold and moist Diseases of the Nerves: being 4 or 5
times bathed upon the place where the Cramp comes, it infallibly cures it. It
comforts the heart, and is prevalent against Fainting and swooning fits, takes
away illness and sickness at stomach, strengthens and fortifies it, and causes
a good Digestion: It is also very good to expel wind, and gives ease in the
most exquisite pains of the Cholick in a Moment: you may give it from gut. xvj
ad xxx. or more, according to the Age and Strength of the sick: and it may be
exhibited in a glass of Canary, or of Rhenish Wine and Sugar, Morning and
Evening: or in the time of any Paroxism or fainting. It gives as it were
immediate relief.

all other weaknesses of those parts: anointed on the part afflicted, and also

17. Potestates Majoranae, Powers of Sweet-Marjoram^.

They are made as th^se of Bawm and Mint.

This Medicament has a Fragrancy scarcely to be exceeded: it is a mighty
Cephalic and Cordial, and performs all that the Powers of Rosemary, Lavender
or Sage can do: It cures all cold and moist Diseases of the head, strengthens
the Memory beyond measure, fortifies the Brain and animal spirits; and dryes up
the humidities of the head most effectually; so that it is thought not to be
inferior to any one thing whatsoever in the cure of the Epilepsy or
Falling Sickness, the Apoplexy, Lethargy, and such other like Diseases of that
part. I have known inveterate Headachs proceeding from a cold and moist cause
cured hereby; and a certain Gentlewoman after many things had been used in
vain, for many months, and that by the Advice of several learned men, for a
most intolerable and violent pain of the head had remedy hereby, being at last
advised to the use hereof by a Neighbor, who had found relief therefrom in
like case: she bathed the part pained and her nostrils therewith, and snufft it
also up her Nostrils: taking some few drops inwardly in a glass of wine. Dose

Faber affirms, that Water to be the highest Poison, and from its Volatile
Spirit, to kill by its odor.

This Salt is one of the chiefest Antidotes against Poison, resisting all Venom

That the distillation may go slowly on, and be performed in about six days. 2.
That it be done in sand. 3. That it be seven times rectified, and every time in
a new glass Retort. 4. That you mix Salt with the wax in stead of Sand, that so

in warm horseaung for a month (Sol and Mercury being in Leo:) after a Months
time ( viz. 40 days which is a medicinal month) let all be distilled in B. M.
in warm ashes, with a very gentle fire. Separate the spirit from the phlegm and
watery part, which you will know in the distillation how to distinguish, by
Vapors ascending up in streaks, being in the head of the Alembick converted
into water: those streaks ceasing, change the Receiver, taking the phlegm, till
the white and clammy spirits ascend. Then is it time again to change the
Vessel, taking the white water which comes forth by it self, augmenting the
fire by degrees, till all the said white water is ascended. Now augment the
fire again, that the Volatile Salt may sublime white and clean, which will
stick to the sides of the Alembick head: this salt keep in a Glass close stopped
with a glass stopper. The spirit and white water put together, and purify by a
seven fold Distillation. After adjoyn the volatile Salt, and distill again
seven times, changing the A^lembick every time, or at leastwise cleansing of

dissolve in distilled rainwater, and purify it by many Evaparations,
desiccations and solutions, till it is freed from all its terrestreity, is
clear as crystal, sweet as sugar, and will melt like wax. Take again new Coral,
powder and mix it with an equal quantity of Sal Armoniack which sublime

Tincture of the Coral. This red Tincture separate from the Salt with
Alchooliz'd S. V. perfectly divested of all its slegm; which is done, by so
often putting on the said S.V. till the Salt remains purely white. Then by a
gentle heat abstract the S.V. by distillation: the Tincture which remains in
the bottom, conjoyn with the before prepared Salt, so have you the Quintessence

may overtop it, about the breadth of eight fingers: stop the Phial close, and
place it in a gentle digestion in warm Ashes for a Month, shaking the Phial

This dissers not much from the Philosophic Oil of Steel, in our Pharm. Lon.
lib. 3. cap. 4. Sect. 14. but only in the praeparation of the Crocus. It is a
wonderful Balsam for the Cure of all Ulcers whether old or new. It powerfully
conglutinates Wounds, dissolves and transmutes Corroding Humors; and preserves
the part from Corruption. It comforts the Stomach, and chears the Spirits. It
stops a Gonorrhaea, the Hepatick flux, and all other Fluxes of the Bowels. Dose

It is made as you make Quintessonce of Baxm or Mint, in Our Pharm. Land. Lib
4. Cap. 5. Sect. 31. and 32.

This Arcanum is of an exceeding sweet scent, by which it recreates the Animal
Spirits and Functions. It is an excellent thing against Obstructions of the
Liver, Spleen and Womb. It prevails against the Green Sickness in Virgins, so
that there is scarce any thing more powerful. It strengthens the Concoctive and
Digestive Faculty, comforts all the Viscera, chears the Spirits, purifies the
Blood, takes away all stoppages, causes a good color in the Face; certainly and
powerfully provokes the Terms, strengthens and cleanses the Womb, and causes
Barren Women to become Fruitful. In easing the Sciatica nothing is more
powerful; it also cures the Elephantiasis (if Faber says true,) and biting of
Venomous Beasts. Dose a j. ad j. Externally you may apply it with a little Lint.

48. Quinta essentia Gambogiae Fabri, Quintessence of Gambogia.

Guttae Gambae lbj. or ij. bruise it, put it into a fit Vessel, and with the
strongest fire, distill ad descensum, increasing the Fire by degrees, till the
Faeces are burnt and incinerated. After distillation, separate the Oil from the
water, which will be in very great plenty. Rectify the Oil in a Retort (with a
little Vitriol calcined to redness) till the Empyreuma is gone: This Oil keep
and conjoyn with the Salt, extracted out of the Ashes of the faces, depurated
by many iterated solutions and calcinations. Now taking again more Guttae
Gambae, viz. vj. or viij. dissolve it (in a Bolt-Head) in the best rectified
SV. mixed with its equal weight of Oil of Vitriol, by digesting it 15 days, in
a warm B. M. then destil in the same Balneo, all that can possibly be drawn
over, Upon the magma remaining put the new distilled Spirit, and digest till it
is perfectly dissolved, viz. for three or four days, then silter it well, and
what will not admit of Filteration, destil as before in the aforesaid B. M.
Again, dissolve, digest, filterate and distill so often as the remaining magma,
will emit any faeces. The Magma being separated from all the S. V. dissolve it
with the juice of Limons, distilled with Spirit of Vitriol; digest all together
in a gentle heat for fifteen days, after which separate the said distilled
juice and spirit, by a boiling B. M. or by warm Ashes, till the Magma is of the
consistency of Honey. To this Magma put the aforeprepared Oil and Salt, which
digest three or four days together, then keep it in a glass close stopped for use.

It cures Quartans, dissolves tartarous Humors, drys up water betwixt the Flesh
and Skin, powerfully exhauriates serose Humors, cures a Leucophlegmatia, the
evil color and Green Sickness in Virgins, strengthens the Ventricle, opens all
Obstructions, and expels Wind. It comforts the Liver, purifies the Blood, opens
the Pores, causes Sweat, and is one of the most powerful Arcanums yet known in
the cure of the Gout; for it takes away the internal Cause, refocillates the
Parts, strengthens the Nerves and Muscles, takes away Trembling, is prevalent
against the Palsy, and other cold and moist Difeases of the Brain, proceeding
of Fiegm: it frees the Breast and Lungs of pituitous Humors, cures the Dropsy,
and takes away the vices of the Skin. Dose a gr. vj. ad x. in broth or syrup,

49. Quinta Essentia Mellis Fabri, Quintessence of Honey.

Honey, dissolve it in Rain Water seven times distilled, despumate it with a
gentle fire, and that so often, till it emits no Faeces in the solution, but
remains in the water in which it is dissolved clear and limpid. Circulate it
for a whole Month in a Pelican, with a gentle heat or fire. Then Destil in
B.M. as much as you can conveniently get over, the rest destil in Ashes to
dryness, even to the burning of the earthy matter. From the Caput Mortuum well
Calcined, elixiviate a Salt, which purify by many iterated solutions and
calcinations, till it is perfectly freed from all firth. This Salt (thus
purified) conjoyn with the Aqua Mollis (which you destilled in B.M.) seven
times distilled, to which add the Oil distilled in Ashes, and made pure by
several rectifications: Digest all leisurely, till it comes to a Balsamic
Body, Quod servardum est tanquam secretum summum sanitatis.

It is accounted one of the highest preservatives of Health, strengthening and
comforting all the Powers and saculties of the Body, Natural, Vital and Animal,
Faber says, Corpus humanum conservat, unde convenit^omnibus morbis. This I
know by experience, that it is good against all Vices of breathing, and
Diseases of the Lungs, as Coughs, Astma's, Hoarsness, Shortiess of Breath, etc.
Dose ad j. in the morning safting, either in the Yolk of an Egg, or in Broth.

50. Quinta Essentia Magnetis Fabri, Quintessence of the Lodestone.

of the Lodestone reduced into a sine powder or Alchool; affuse upon it the
Quintessence of Iron, which digest in a Bolt-Head, close stopped, and in a warm
B.M. for 15 days and nights. This done, put it into a glass Retort well luted,
and distill in Ashes, by degrees of Fire, first gentle, then stronger, till you
come to the strongest. The Caput Mortuum or magma which remains, by breaking of
the Retort, take and reduce to fine powder, which calcine in a strong Fire, for
one whole day: the Calx dissolve in the best and sharpest Vinegar, extract the
Salt, which by many Lotions, Solutions and Calcinations, bring to the highest
purity and to a red color. This Salt conjoyn with the Q E. of the Iron,
impregnated with the Spirit of the Magnet, which digest for three or four days
in a warm B.M. and by B. M. abstract whatever willascend, the rest digest with
a gentle Fire, and continual, till it is all fixed, and nothing more will
ascend, though by a strong Distillation, but it remains melted and liquid in
the bottom of the Vessel or Stillatory, like as melted Sal Nitre; which
humidity is so tied to it, that the force of the fire is not able to separate
it, unless it be immediately touched with live Coals. Thus have you the
Quintessence of the Magnet, which keep as of miraculous us.

It is a mighty thing in curing of all manner of Wounds and Ulcers, stopping of
all Fluxes of blood, all Dysenteries, Lienterias, Diarrhaea's, drys up all salt
and serous Catarrhs, cures the Hepatick Flux, Hemorthage, Cramp, Convulsion and
Stupefaction of any Member; it augments the Natural Heat, comforts the Animal
Spirits, and revives the Vitals. It cures the Dropsy, and draws out all serous
and watery Humors: and is one of the greatest Medicines that is known for the
Spleen, and Obstructions thereof, for it attenuates and purifies the Blood,
exhausting all icorous, serous and putrid juyces, and therefore is certainly an
excellent thing against the Seurvy. Dose a gut x. and xx. in Canary, or some
water appropiate to the Disease, to be taken in the morning fasting. Outwardly
it is applied to Wounds and Ulcers, either on Lint, or mixed with proper
Unguents, Oils or Balsams.

51. Quint a Essentia Mechoacannae, Fabri, Quintessence of Mechoacan.

Mechoacan in fine powder, affuse upon it Alchooliz'd S. V. which digest for
fifteen days, or a whole month in a warm B. M. till it sends forth its
Hypostasis, then decant off the clear from the troubled, and silterate it. To
the Magma remaining put new S.V. Alchooliz'd, and digest 8 days in a warm B. M.
as before: decant filterate and affuse new S. V. again, digesting as before 4
days; decant, filterate and join it to the former Tinctures, and distill them
together with a gentle fire, till the Magma be of the consistency of Honey.
This work so often repeat, till the Magma leaves at the end of the Distillation
(in the Alembick) no Faeces, nor emits any Faeces in the solution. This Magma
thus purified, conjoyn with the Oil drawn from fresh Mechoacan per descensum
(or otherwise) and well rectified or freed from its Empyreuma, by the help of
Vitriol calcined to redness: to which add the pure Salt, extracted from all its
Faeces, calcined; being first made very pure and white: digest them together,
and keep the Quintessence in a glass close stopped for use.

It is a great Arcanum in all kind of Madness, Phrensies and Melancholy: for it
extracts the melancholy and adust Humors, which infest the Menings of the
Brain, and casts them forth. Now if after this purgation, you give a few drops
of Oleum Argenteum, in a proper Vehicle, the Cure will not only be safe, but
certain. It cures also the Palsy, quartan Agues, and all other chronick
Diseases. I have found it very powerful in the Gout, Dropsy, Scurvy, and old
Head-achs; as also in Vertogo's, Megrims, and such like capital Diseases, for
which it is commended as a secret. Dose a j. ad ij. in Broth, proper Water, or

decripitated, A. put them into a well luted Retort, with its Receiver, and
Distill with degrees of fire, till all the sulphurous Spirit both of the Salt
and of the Bismuth is drawn off, and is very sour. This done, take the Magma in
the bottom, and free it from the Salt, by washing it several times in pure fair
Water, till the water comes off, without any taste of the Salt. the Marchasite
thus depurated, fine Niter, A. mix them, and in a Crucible with a live coal set
them on fire, which let burn till the Thunder is over and the Niter is
vanished. Then take the Marchasite again, and by many Lotions in fair water as
before, free it absolutely from the Nitor. This most fine powder of the
Marchasite, put into a Bolt-Head, stop it well with good lute, and put it into
a Reverberating fire for a Month, till it acquires a red color. After take it
away, and to this powder affuse its own Spirit, seven times rectified, digest
them together in a warm B. M till the Spirit is colored; the Tincture decant by
inclination, and put on new Spirit, so as it may overtop it four fingers
breadth, and digest as before, till it is again colored. When you have gotten
the whole Tincture, digest in B. M. for 15 days, then distill by a Retort 3 or 4
times, and a most red Oil will come forth, which being joined with its own
Spirit, freed from its phlegm, and impregnated with its own Tincture, you have
the Quintessence of the golden Marchasite, and a most excellent Arcanum.

It is an admirable thing in the cure of Scrophula, or the Kings Evil, whether
uicerated or not: for it resolves all hard Tumors, and morifies all sorts of
Cancers. It is no caustic or burning Medicine, if rightly prepared, but may be
taken inwardly; and so taken, it purifies the blood from mucous and serous
Humors, by Sweat and Urine; correcting and amending all the vices thereof. It
takes away all Scabs, and every kind of excoriation of the Skin, only by
outwardly applying it, being mixed with Oils, Balsams, and Unguents, proper
against Scabs. Dose inwardly gut x. in Broth.

53. Quint essentia Medullarum omnium Fabri, Quintessence of all forts of
Marrows.

a large quantity of what Marrow you please, in the full of the Moon, put it
into a Retort, so as it may fill it half full, join to it a receiver, closing
the joints well: distill in Ashes, augmenting the fire by degrees, till all is
distilled over: the Distilled Oil rectify by another Retort, three or four
times, by adding a little Vitriol calcined to redness, in each distillation; so
have you a most penetrating Oil, freed from its Empyreuma: from the faeces well
calcined, extract a pure Salt, which free from all its Terrestreity, which add
to the said Oil, so have you the Quintessence of great Virtues.

This Quintessence, extracted from the Marrow of what Animal soever, is a
stupendous Arcanum, in easing of all sorts of pains and arthritick dolors. It
resolves Oedema, and discusses all sorts of cold and hard Tumors, Nodes, and
such like, in any part of the the Body. But to this purpose the Quintessence of
the Marrow, and the Oil of Mams bones exceed all others. The Oil and Salt from
the Marrow and Bones of a Horse or Mare, wonderfully discuss Scirrhous Tumors,
and such as have a Stone like hardness in them. If it be from the brains and
bones of a Horse Head, it cures Epilepsies, Apoplexies, and such like. These
kind of Quintessences will soften and discuss even the hardest Callosity or
Node.

54. Quenta Essentia Ossium humanum Fabri, Quintessence of Man's Bones.

Man's bones in gross powder (and infused in generous wine, for 8 days) of which
make an Oil per descensum, which rectify by a seaven-fold distillation, in a
Retort. The faeces or Caput Mortuum calcine in a strong fire, from which Calx,
with boiling water, extract a Salt, which purify and make white; then conjoyn
it, with its aforeprepared Oil, and digest that they may be perfectly
incorporated. This will be best and most efficaciously done, at Sol his
Entrance into Aries, which is about the tenth day of March every Year. The same
ought to be observed in making the Salt of Man's Skull, with sweet Spirit of
Vitriol.

There is nothing in Rerum Natura, more powerful than this Balsam, in easing
and taking away all manner of arthritick pains and torments. It speedily takes
away all kind of rottenness, and corrects every other vice of the Bones. Let it
be applied warm in manner of a Balsam with Lint, to the part affected. But in
order to its curing of the Gout, the body ought to be purged three or four
times with a specific Cathartick for that purpose, especially cum pilulis ex
Mercurio spagyrice preparato, or with the Pilulae Lunares, mixed with a few
grains of the Extract of black Hellebor, from whence you will see wonderful
effects.

what Birds you please, and chop them into small bits with their Bones (the
Feathers, Skin, and Fat being taken away:) put them into a Bolt-Head, and place
it in B. M. that it may boil for about four hours: this done, whilst it is hot,
decant from the Bolt-Head (into another vessel) all the liquor which is
separated from the flesh. This liquor depurate in B. M. till it emits no
faeces, which are to be extracted or separated in three days, by de^auting the
liquor from the closed Vessel, boiling in B. M. the former remaining flesh and
bones burn, and calcine to whiteness; from which white Calx or Ashes, with
rectified Rose Water (not distilled in a Leaden or Pewter Still) extract a
Salt, which by many solutions, filterations and calcinations, bring to pure
whiteness and sweetness, and conjoyn it with the aforesaid Liquor.

This is an excellent thing to restore the radical moisture, cure Consumptions,
conserve Health, and keep back old Age. It is dedicated to Kings, Princes, and
great Persons and to all such as desire to live long, by preserving their
Health. If thereto you add sal Margaritarum, it will be yet of greater
efficacy; for in that Salt is contained a certain Balsam of Life, with which
every Philosopher is not acquainted. It cures the Phthisis, and Hectic,
strengthens the whole body, and comforts all the natural and vital faculties,
it may be given every hour in Broth, or something to drink. This Quintessence
made of Capons, Patridges, Phesants, Larks, and such like Birds, is most
effectual to the purposes aforesaid. After the same method you may make a
Quintessence of Serpents (casting away their Heads and Tails) for the same
intentions as also to cure the Leprosy, Elephantiasis, French Pox, etc. So also
for all sorts of Flshes for Phthisicks or Ulcers of the Lungs, Hectic Feav^rs,
and other wastings of the Body.

56. Quinta Essentia Saturni Fabri, Quintessence of Lead.

and augment the fire, till all the white and sweet Spirit of the Lead are come
forth; and at length an oily substance of a yellow color, and lastly a red.
This Oylrectify four or five times. The black faeces at the bottom of the
Retort, take out, burn, and with a strong fire calcine, till they attain the
highest whiteness. From this Calx, with rain water seven times distilled in a
boiling B.M. draw forth the fixed Salt, which filterate through Brown paper;
then evaporate, calcine again, dissolve, and filterate, as before; which work
so often repeat, till the Salt is purely white, sweet, and easy to be melted
in a gentle heat like wax or Butter. This Salt you shall conjoyn to the White
Spirit, and digest them in a warm B. M. for 15 days. Then distill, adding the
distilled Liquor to the Magma, so long till the fixed Salt ascends and becomes
Volatile, which Salt 7 times sublime and conjoyn to the aforesaid Oils
seventimes rectified: digest them together in a warm BM for a Month, so have
you the Q.E. of Saturn or Lead.

This Arcanum is the Balsam of Balsams for the Cure of all sorts of Wounds,
Uicers, burnings, scaldings, and such like affects. It cures Hecticks,
Phthisicks, and Consuptions; extinguishes the preternatural heat of Fevers,

Bits of Rubys or Granates, and calcine them 3 or 4 times with an equal
quantity of Sulphur and Niter in a strong Crucible, Repeat the Ignition or
Calcination till the Calx is purely white: then wash it in warm water to free
it from the Salt, and dry it by the fire in a strong Crucible for 2 or 3 days.
To the pure white powder affuse (^f you please rectified) spirit of Salt in a
wide glass: or to the spirit of Salt, put rather by degrees the Powder, lest it
should boil over. The Ebulition ceasing, put the Powder and liquor into a glass
Mattress, close up the mouth well, and digest for 15 days in a Boiling B.M.
till the powder is dissolved. If in the first digestion it be not wholly
dissolved, decant the first spirit, and on the remainder affuse new, digesting
as before, till the whole powder is swallowed up by the spirit. All these
solutions put into a bolt head, seal it up, and digest for a month in a warm B.
M: that they may make a better Dissolution, and become a clear Water, which in
a shorter time will scarcely be done. Then by Retort, draw off the spiritu us
water of the Salt; after, change the Receiver, and augment the fire; so have
you the rubicund Essence of the Ruby or Granate. If all will not ascend, but
somewhat yet remains in the Retort, dissolve that again with the former spirit
of Salt, first drawn off, by digesting it for several days, then drawing off
the Spirit of Salt first, and after, changing the Receiver, with a stronger
fire, force the whole Substance of the Ruby to ascend; which if it be not
sufficiently red, digest in it new powder of Rubies till it is well colored,
which then keep in a glass close stopped for use.

57. Quinta essentia Terebinthinae, Fabri, Quintessence of Tupentine.

Venice Turpentine lbj or ij, mix it with as much of the best rectified S. V.
stirring them with a little stick, till they be united. Put them into a large
Glass body, so big, as that not above a third, or at most an half part be full;
shake them then together so long till they become white; then put them into a
cold place, that its hypostasis may appear; the Spirit of Wine swimming above
all, and the Turpentine dissolved into a yellow Oil; lastly, a certain Salt of
Turpentine of a pure white Color, which being separated and dried, is a
Cathartick of most excellent Virtues, purging downwards without any molestation
or trouble. The S. V. and Oil mix together and digest in a warm B.M. in a glass
close stopped for 1.5 days. Then distill in Ashes with degrees of Fire, first
very gentle, till the spirit of Turpentine, with the S.V. and phlegm are come
forth. Now change the Receiver, and angment the fire, so will you have a yellow
oil; and continuing and augmenting the fire still, you will have a red Oil;
which ceasing to come, cease the Distillation: The yellow and red oils, join
together, which two or three times rectify by a Retort. The Magma remaining at
the bottom of the Alembick take and beat it into sine Powder; to which add
double its weight of the Spirit of Turpentine, (which you had in the first
distillation) joined with the Spirit of Wine, digest them altogether in a warm
B.M. for 15 days, till the Magma is all dissolved, which distill with a very
gentle fire: Cohobate, digest and distill again, which often repeat till the
spirit ascends with the Volatile Salt of the Turpentine, which comes forth at
last, which is either coagulated in the top of the Alembick in form of Honey;
or, resides in the bottom of the Receiver in form of Oil. The Magma which
resides after this last Distillation, burn and calcine, out of which draw a
Salt, (which is but small) by Elixiviation. If you desire much of this sixed
Salt (because the whole substance is sulphurous, and of Volatile parts) you
must add to the Magmate, a large quantity of Rosin, which you must burn and
reduce to Ashes together, from which extract a Salt, and depurate it by the
common rules. This Salt conjoyn with the former Volatile Salt; adding to their
whole weight, a sixth part of the spirit of Turpentine, or something less, and
of the yellow and red Oils, a ninth or tenth part, which mix well together, and
keep it in a glass close stopped for use.

in both Reins and Bladder. It is one of the greatest Diuretics and Openers,
cleansing the urinary passages of all manner of filth and matter which
obstructs them, or stops the making of water. It cures all Wounds and old
Ulcers, though never so malign and rebellious. It cases pains of the Gout, and
comforts and strengthens the Nerves to a wonder, curing most Diseases happening
to them, In curing a virulent Gonorrhaea, it has been found of excellent use,
for it powerfully cleanses and expurges the filth. It softens the Mesentery,

all filth and impurity, which Salt conjoyn with the aforesaid Oil and volatile
Salt, and keep the mixture for use.

CHAP. VI. Of ELIXIRS.
1. ELixir Proprietatis Tartarizatum, Tartarized Elixir of Property.

Aloes, Myrrh, Saffron, A. j. moisten all with Tartarized Spirit of Wine,
bringing the Aloes and Myrrh first into an Alchool by grinding: first extract
the Tincture of the Saffron by affusing thereon lbj. of Tartarized S.V. in the
Tincture put the pouders of the Aloes and Myrrh, close the Vessel well, and
circulate all for three Months; extract the Tincture and decant it: add
tartarized S.V. again to the matter remaining, extract again and decant it:
then distill the Faeces which remain and add it to the former; and again, for a
Month (without distillation) circulate them. Others extract the Tincture with
Salt of Tartar Volatilized with S.V. by digestion; or with Tincture of Salt of
Tartar, digesting so long till the bitterness of the Aloes is much abated.

This is a noble Medicament, of very hot and thin parts, containing all the
Virtues of the natural Balsam, conserving nature to extreme old age. It cures
Quartans, and is good against the Stone, in either Reins or Bladder. It
quickens all the Senses, strengthens the Brain and Memory, cures the Vertigo,
Lethargy, Megrim, Headache, Epilepsy, Palsy, Pleurisy, Convulsions, Jaundice,
Consumption, Rickets, Catarrh, Scurvy, Plague, Pestilent Fevers, Gout and

Opinion much superior to them, curing most Diseases proceeding from corruption
and putrefaction of Humors. It purifies the Blood, facilitates its circulation,
and is a specific in the cure of the Kings Evil, Scurvy, Dropsy, Gout,
Jaundice, Scabs, Itch, Herpes, all sorts of breakings out, and many almost

It is a most admirable Cure for a Consumption; I cured herewith a certain
woman of an inveterate Pining and Wasting, a supposed incurable Consumption,
accompanied with vehement Dolors of the Bowels, after a two years despair, when
she was so weak she could not stand alone without two to hold her, looking like
(as it were) the picture of Death, and given over as past hopes by several very
able and learned men. The alone taking of this Medicine in Sack or Milk, and
sometimes in Ale sweetened, but most commonly in Milk, morning, noon and night,
and sometimes 5 or 6 times a day, for about a month or 5 weeks time, restored
her (through the blessing of God) to the Wonder of all that knew her. It is
also a present Remedy against the Cholick, and all gripings and pains of the
Bowels: and potently provokes the Terms, if given for some days according to
Art. Dose so much as will make the Vehicle, so hot as the sick can well endure
it.

humors even to a Miracle, and is of exceeding use to such as are itchy or
mangy, leprous, or have old filthy running Sores about them, especially in the
Legs, and parts depending, it removes Scabs, and venereal Botches, and mightily
facilitates the cure of the French Pox. Dose ad one Spoonful or a spoonful and
half, in the morning fasting: It may be taken twice or thrice a week; or, after
the Use of Mercuriat^s; with which it may be alternately exhibited; twice the

This Tincture purges admirably, viz. that made by the first praescript, nor
are the other much inferior; but the last purges the most excellently: they
evacuate all watery humors, cure the Dropsy, Jaundice, Scurvy, Gout, Cachexia,
Green Sickness, and other evil dispositions of the body: Dose a j. or more.

17. Tinctura Caryophylorum, Tincture of Cloves.

Cloves slit in two, or bruised ii, Tartarised S.V. so much as to over top them
about 4 Inches: put them into a Mattress, make a donble Vessel, with another
small Mattress fitted to the former, lute them well together, and digest in a
sand heat, till the S.V. becomes of a red blackish Color, which separate by
Inclination, and keep it in a glass well stopped for use.

1. Of this Tincture may be made a Syrup, by putting to it Sugar, q.s. and so
dissolving according to Art. 2. You may also make of it an Extract, by
Evaporating the Tincture to the thickness of Honey. 3. The Virtues. These are
all good to strengthen and comfort a cold stomach, by drying up cold
superfluous humors, it prevails against swoonings and faintings of the Heart,
and gives ease in all Gripings and pains of the Cholick: It expels wind, and
kills worms in the Body. Dose ab ss ad j in Sack: outwardly bath the parts
afflicted with it.

18. Tinctura Argentea, Tincture of Luna.

Silver filings ij: best spirit of Niter vj: dissolve in a Cucurbit: then
precipitate with salt water lbij; so will the Calx fall down in a white powder:
let it stand a while, that all the Calx may fall, then decant the water by
inclination: wash the Calx after with fair water to free it from all its
Acrimony, dry it upon paper, and put it into a Mattress, to it put Velatile Salt
of Urine j. S.V. rectified xxjv (let it be rectified with salt of Tartar: stop
the mouth of the Mattress with another so as the mouth of the one may enter into
the neek of the other; (which thing is also called a dou^le Vessel:) lute well
the Joints with a wet bladder, digest in horse-dung, or the like gentle heat
for 16 days; so will the S.V. be of a bright sky color, which take, siltrate,
and keep close stopped.

1. This Tincture is of admirable use in many Diseases of the head, as
Cephalea, Megrim, Epilepsie, Palsy, Apoplexy, etc. It may be given also against
all malignant and pestilential Fevers, and the Plague it self; as also in the
small Pox and Measles: Dose a gut. vj ad xvj. in choice Canary or same
cordial-water, as the Aqua vitae Matthioli. 2. Here is also to be noted, That
at the bottom of the Mattress will remain a Calx of Silver, out of which you may
extract a Salt; or you may reduce it into silver again by the following Method.
3. Take Niter viij, Crystal in powder, ij. Tartat j. Charcole ss. powder all,
and put it by little and little into a Crucible heated red hot, after the
Dotonation is over, the matter will be melted, which pout into a warm Mortar to
cool: then powder it, and mix with it as much of the sormer Galx at sect. 2.
above:melt them in a Crucible with a strong fire, so will the Calx be reduced
into Silver again, which when cold, you may separate from the Salts. 4. This
Tincture is not a separation of one of the Principles; or of the sulphur of
Luna from the other Principles; but only a dissolution of a part of the body of
the Metal, being Volatiliz'd by the Salt of Urine, and united to the Spirit of
Wine. 5. You may prove it thus: Put the Tincture into a Glass-body, with a
Receiver well luted; distill in B. V. till one half is drawn off: the remainder
in the Cucurbit set to Crystallize, for two days; and continue the
Crystallization, till no more will shoot: put all the Crystals together, dry,
and weigh them, then powder them, putting to every ij thereof iij, of the
mixture, at 3. above, for reviving the Calx of Silver: this mixture meit in a
crucible, covered with a Tile, by help of a strong sire, then taking the
crucible our, letting of it cool, and breaking it, you will find the silver
(before dissolved into Tincture) at bottom. 6. The Salt water used in this work
must be made of Water lbij: in which salt jss is to be dissolved; for Salt
engages the points of the dissolvant, and makes it let go its hold of the
Silver. You may also make the Precipitation by putting into it little bits of
Copper Plates. It is no matter which way you use, for it is done to no other
purpose, but to bring the Silver into a very sine powder, that it may the more
easily be dissolved afterward 7. The Silver Calx remaining (after the Tincture
is extracted) is impregnated with Volatile parts, and would (if it should be
melted alone) fly into the Air: but being mixed with the aforementioned
matter, it is kept down, and hindered from flying away in its reduction.

19. Tinctura Martis cum Tartaro, Tincture of Mars with Tartar.

Rust of Iron made by Dew xij. white Tartar lbij: powder and mix them together,
boil them in a great Iron kettle with Rainwater lbxv. for 12 hours: stir with
an Iron Spatula from time to time, and put in more water (but boiling hot) as
the former consumes; at last, let it settle a while, so have you a black
Liquor, which is the Tincture: siltrate it, and evaporate it in an carthen Pan
over a sand heat, to the thickness of a Syrup, or till a Pellicule shall arise.

1. Here is to be noted, That water alone is not alde to penetrate and diss^^ve
the Iron, should it bo^^ never so long; but the water being impregnated with
Ta^^ar causes it to dissolve with much ease. 2. The Tincture being drawn, there
will a white Matter remain (a mixture of the Earthy parts of Tartar and Mars)
which may be cast away, as good for nothing, 3. This Tincture some call Syrrup
of Mars because of a noble sweetness in its Taste; and it is reduced to the
thickness of a Syrrup, that it might keep the better. 4. As to its Virtues, It
is a very great Apetitive, opens the most inveterate Obstructions of the Liver,
Spleen, Pancreas, Mesentery, Reins and Womb: is excellent and Cachexies,
Dropsies, Obstruction of the Terms, etc. Its opening Virtues are much
strengthened by the Power of the Tartar: It sweetens the acid Humor, which is
the cause of all Obstructions, for Mars is a certain Alcalie: dose a ss ad j,
in broth, or some other sit Vehicle.

20. Tinctur a Succini, Tincture of Amber.

white Amber levigated on a Porphery jv, put upon it S. V. rectified, so much
as may cover it abont 4 inches above the Powder; these being in a glass-Matrass
cover it with a small blind Head, well luting the Juncture, digest in a very
gentle heat in Sand, shaking the Glass of ten, till the S. V. has dissolved the
greatest part of the Amber, and the Tincture becoms of a transparent yellow.
Vnlute the Vessels: decant this Tincture into a Glass bottle, and upon the
Magma put sresh S. V. alcooliz'd, cover it as before, and digest again, till
the S. V. has almost diss^lv'd the rest of the Amber, and it becomes Tinctured,
as before. This Tincture decant, and put to the former, filter them through
brown Paper (but some Authors like it not, because a certain Volatility is lost
through the attraction of the Air) put the whole into a small Glass Cucurbite,
place it in a sand Heat, cover it with its head, fitting to it a small
Receiver: Lute well the Junctures, and with a gentle heat draw off the one half
of the S. V. The Vessels being cold, put what remains in the Bottom of the
Cucurbit into a Glass, which stop close and keep for use. Being the true
Tincture of Amber, impregnated with the Taste and Smell of its own natural
substance, and full of volatile parts.

1. This Tincture has all the Virtues of Amber mentioned in our Pharmacopoea
Londinensis, lib. 3. cap. 12. Sect. 49. where they are described at large, and
performs all those things with ten times more power and efficacy, than the
crude prepared Amber can do, and therefore it is here commended as a most
excellent thing. 2. Some precipitate the Amber by putting sair Water into the
Tincture, but this precipitate of Amber has no more Virtues than Levigated
Amber, although indeed it may be somewhat more pure: for having lost the
Volatile Sulphur which subtilized and actuated it, it becoms gross and terr^ne
again: so that indeed, you do but undo what you have been doing with great
Labor. 3. But as all its Virtues are chiefly designed against Diseases of the
Head, Brain, Nerves, and Womb, so ought it to be given in some proper Syrrups,
as of Cinnamon, Peony-flowers, etc. or in some Ethereal Spirit of Rosemary,
Juniper Berries, Black Cherries or Spirit of flowers of Lilly Convally; for
that if it should be given in any aqueous Liquor, the Amber would return to a
body, whereby its effects would not be so good nor quick: dose d j ad j.

21. Tinctura Pilularum nostrarum, Tincture of our Family Pills.

of our Family Pills in fine Powder jv, Quintessence of Aniseed or of some
other Spice, enough to overtop it 6 or 8 Inches: digest in a very gentle heat
for 10 or 12 days, shaking it 2 or 3 times a day, till the Tincture is perfect;
which decant, and keep in a Vessel close stopped for use: if you think the
Tincture is not wholly extracted, you may put upon the Magma, a small proportion
of new Menstrum; which you may after ten days decant, and with other fresh
Menstruum put it upon new powder.

It has all the Virtues which are afcril'd to the Pills, works excellently and
casily upon all humors, purges water and phlegm powerfully, and prevails
against the Scurvy, Dropsy, Jaundice, Gout, Green Sickness, Cachexia, and all
Obstructions of the Stomach Liver, Spleen, Mesentery and Bowels: Dose two or
three Spoonfulls according to Strength.

five inches over: seal up the Glass, and let it remain in Sand for a month
(shaking the Vessel every day) or for so long time as you shall think sit: then
separate the clear Tincture, and keep it for use.

It is a strong and potent Diaphoretick, and causes sweat beyond most other
things: you may give it in Carduus or Cinnamon water or in T^^acle water, or
other fit Vehicle, a gut. xx ad lx. or ad j.

half of the Liquor in B. M. keep the remaining part for use.

in dysenty rick affections, and indeed by many Physicians it is esteemed (but
how truly, I know not) the most safe of any Laudanum. Dose a gut. xv. ad xx or
xxv. in Canary or other proper Vehicle.

24. Tinctura Corallorum Digbeij, Sir Kenelm Digby's Tincture of Coral.

the most sharp spirit or Oil of Honey (made by distillation of Honey, p. j.
with sand, p. ij. in a sand-Furnace:) put it upon powder of 'red Coral, and, in
24 hours the spirit of Honey will be tinged of a deep yellow color: decant and
put on more spirit of Honey, and digest as before: reiterate this till it will
tinge no more:then filter the Tinctures, and distill the Liquor off, that the
Tincture may remain dry: upon which put good S. V. which digest till it is

this reiterate, till all the Tincture is extracted: Filterate these Tinctures,
and draw off the S. V. by Distillation: Upon the Magma remaining put new S. V.
and repeat this work, till you have the pure Tincture and Solution without
Faeces, which will be as deep as the reddest wine, and thoroughly transparent.

is a Specific in Diseases of the Head, Womb and Nerves: Dose a gut. xx ad xxx.

There are many Panthymagogons extant, but I have found this by manisold
Experience to exceed all others. It universally purges all humors, and that
both safely and pieasantly, and is truly a very noble Cathartick or purge. If
it be given in obdurate Obstructions, and such as are inveterate, resisting the
Powers of most Medicines in this Case, it will be well if you add to the
Composition iiss of Mercurius dulcis in fine or impalpable powder, for by this
means it will have force and strength to melt (as it were) any impacted humor,
though never so tough and viscous; and to dissolve all manner of tartarous
Matter, wheresoever obstructed in any part of the Body. Dose a gr. vij, ad j:
or ss, if in strong Bodies, it works nimbly, and therefore may be given Early

hermetically, and digest for 20 days in B.M. then decant the Wine, and put en
more alchoolized Spirit, till the Virtue is extracted: put these tinged spirits
together, and draw off the spirit in a very gentie B.M. till it is thick at
bottom. Upon this Extract put alcooliz'd tincture of Cloves; Circulate them ten
days, and after abstract the S. V. and the Extract will be at bottom.

This Extract is of mighty power for purifying of the blood, flesh and skin,

Fevers. It cures the Goat, Consumption and French Pox; esteem it as a Jewel.

thickness of Honey: then add Salts, with the other things in powder, as also
the Aurum potabile, or for want thereof the Oils, which mix well together, and
keep it in a close glazed Vessel for use.

Here is to be noted, That because Opium often causes Vomit, if you mix with it
Oil of Wormwood, gut. 40 or 50. it will be much more stomachical, and indeed if
Oil of Wormwood be used in stead of all the Oils, it will not be amiss. It
eases all manner of Pains in a Moment, stops all sorts of Fluxes, as Catarrhs,
Flux of the Bowels, Terms, Whites, Bleeding, etc. It is a specific in
Plenrisies, Fits of the Mother, the Cholick, griping of the Guts, restlessness,

If the Opium and the other things be first extracted with tartarized S. V. and
afterward dissolved in Spirit of Vinegar, or of Vitriol, Sulphur or Salt, or
most sharp juice of Limons, and then inspissated to the thickness of Honey, the
Laudanum will be so much the better. In stopping all Catarrhs and Fluxes, as of

Vomiting, Pleurisy, Cholick, Weakness of Bowels; in the Gout, in knees, feet or

indeed much more powerful: where note, That if it be given to women subject to
fits, it will be good to leave out the M^sch and Ambergrise: or you may make

Pancreas of thick earthy matter by stool: you may give it in a Wafer, in form
of a Bolus, drinking after it a little white wind or sherry, and an hour or two
after a little Broth or posset drink: it purges gently, and expels Viscous
matter from the sides of the Ventricle and the Guts: opens obstructions of
Spleen and Mesentery: you may take it once in 5 days, while you take the
aforementioned spirit of Scurvy Grass; for by this order it e^adicates a cold
Scorbute. Dose a j ad ij or iij.

13. Extractum Martis Aperitivum, Opening Extract of Iron.

Rust of Iron made by dew viij: Aqua Mellis lb iij: Must or Wine unf^rmented lb
jv: Juice of Limons jv: put all into an iron Pot, cover it with an iron cover,
set it in a Furnace over a little fire, digest for 3 days time, then boil
gently for 4 hours, stirring it now and then from the bottom with an Iron
spatula, thou covering it again, that it may not evaporate too fast: when you
see the Liquor is black, take way the fire, let it settle, and strain it warm
through a Cloth, then evaporate the humidity in sand heat, in an earthen Pan,
to the Consistency of an Extract.

1. The Virtues of this Extract are mightily augmented by the Addition of the
Essential Salts, and the Spirit of Honey, which makes it as good a Remedy as
can be of this Kind, no better yet known. 2. It is a mighty Aperitive, opening
all Obstructions, and restoring a good Complexion to such as want it by reason
of Oppilations of the Liver, Spleen and M^sentery: But it ought not to be given
only once or twice, but for 14, 20 or 30 days together, yet with some little
Intervals, that Nature might not be nauseated. Dose a gr. x. and ij. dissolved
in some fit Vehicle. Its Virtues are the same with the Tincture in Cap. 7.
sect. 19. of this Book. It takes away obstructions of the Lacteals and
L^m^hatick Vessels admirably, thereby being a means to restore such as are in
Consumptions.

14. Extractum Rhabarbart, Extract of Rhubarb.

Rhubarb lbx: let it be shaved, and digested 12 hours in warm Succory-water, so
much as may overtop it 4 or 5 Inches, let it just boil, then strain it through
a cloth: put the Rhubarb into as much more Succory-water, which Infuse, boil
and strain, as before, expressing it strongly: mix the Liquors, let them
settle, filterate them, and evaporate the humidity in a glass Vessel, over a
soft fire, to the thickness of Honey; so have you the Extract of Rhubarb, which
keep in a Pewter pot close covered.

1. This has all the virtues of Rhubarb, and may be given a gr. x. ad ij, being
dissolved in Succory or Strawberry water, or made into Pills: it prevails in
Diseases of the Liver and Spleen, purges and binds. 2. After this manner you
may make the Extracts of all Vegetables, which are not Resinous or Aromatic:
The refinous are made with S.V. The Aromatic or odoriferous ought not to be
Extracted in this kind, for that their best and most Volatile parts would be
carried away in Evaporation, but if any shall be so minded; they may Evaporate
by Distillation, whereby you will save an odoriferous water. 3. Many learned
men have doubted in what principle the purgative Virtue of these things do
consist: some say, In the Salt: some, in the Sulphur or Oil; some, in the
Mercury or Spirit: but each Principle being separated, we have found that none
of them have been purging; whereby we know in separating the Principles, That
property or Faculty is totally destroyed, nor can it be repaired by any
artificial mixing them again: So that We conclude, That, the proper Purging
Power is conserved only in the natural mixion of the Principles, so as is
necessary to produce such struggling and fermentations in our Bodies: And, hence
it appears, that Nature does something so exquisitely, that Art can never
attain unto; nay, nor imitate the same, what God has joined together ought not
to be put asunder, man ought not to be wiser than his God.

19. Extractum odorificum Paracelsi, The Specific odoriferous Extract.

White Lillies, Rosemary-flowers, Basil, Cardamoms, Roses, A. M. j. spicknard
M. ii. beat them grossly in a past: to which add juice of Orange Apples lbiv:
put all these together into a Pelican, and let them be digested together for
one Month, afterward let them be separated from their faeces by straining with
pressing: put this expressed Liquor again into a Pelican, and presently let be
added Mace, Cloves, Cinnamon, Civet, A. j: Ambergrise, ss: Musk ij: grind them
most exceeding small, and put them into the said Pelican with the other
things, then digest in Dung, then add Gum Arabic dissolved ss: Tragacanth
dissolved j: and let them harden with the clea^ of the whites of Eggs in a shut
Glass: then after a white as soon as you see it become of the likeness of
glass, break your Glass, and you have a stone which is our Odoriferous
specific.

The Intention of this odoriferous Extract is to be a perfume ready at all
times and upon all occasions to perfume other Medicaments with: for that it
immediately expands it self and dilates its specific Odor and Virtues.
However it is a great Cordial, and may be given in any fainting fits a gr. iij
ad viij in any proper Vehicle.

CHAP. IX. Of MAGISTERYS.
MAgisterium seu Resina Jallapae, Magistery or Resin of Julap.

five powder of Jallap, put it into a Pelican, and put upon them rectifi^d
S.V. so much as over-reposit a hands breadth; close up the head, and set it to
digest in Balneo, till the Tinctatets as red as blood: pour off this Tincture
and put in more S.V. which work repeat till the Tincture is wholly extracted:
put all the Tinctures together, and in Balneo draw off above half of the spirit
(which reserve for the like occasion again) then put into it fair water, and
the Jallap will precipitate to the bottom: at last draw off in B.M. the remaing
S.V. and take the resin out of the water, which dry and keep for use.

1. Here is to he observed, first, That if you evaporate all the Spirit, the
Magistery will be black, and may be more properly called an Extract, yet it
will be of the same Virtue, as if precipitated, though not so beautiful. 2.
That if you precipitate according to the Prescript, you will do well to let the
white mixture to settle for a whole day. 3. That the Resin before it is dried,
ought to be well washed in two or three waters, after which being dry, it will
be hard, and not much unlike common Rosin. 4. That before your Jallap is beaten
into powder, it be very well cleansed and dried, that the Resin may be the
purer. 5. That the reason of the Praecipitation by cold water, is from weakening
of the S.V. whereby it cannot hold up, what it has drawn, but lets it fall to
the Bottom. 6. That this Magistery is rather a Resin than a Gum, because that
it dissolves rather in Oily liquors than in watery. 7. That if you put cold
water in before evaporation or drawing off the one half of the Spirit, the
precipitation will be like Resin; but after the drawing off of the said half,
it pretates like a Curd, which comes to a powder. 8. That this Magistery is
nothing but the Resin or pure Cathartick part of Jailap, separated from the
terrestial part and Volatile Salt, which has been dissolved in the S.V. 9. That
in drawing off the one half of the S.V. you must do it with a very gentle fire,
for if it be too strong, it will carry along with it a good part of the Resin.
10. That all the Cathartick Virtue of the Jallap consists in the Resin: from
the Faeces you may draw an Alcalious Salt, but in a very small quantity.
However is it not yet apparently known wherein the Cathartick force of
Purgatives does Consist. 11. That this Resin is a great Hydragogue, or
water-purger: now why Hydrag^gues do rather purge water than other humors, is
because they have more of the Acrimony, than other Purgers have, whereby they
are the better able to open and penetrate the Lymphatick Vessels. 12. That this
and other Hydragogues do so cut and attenuate Viscosities, as to render them
like to water; and indeed all such things as chiefly purge water are either
Resinous or Saline for as Sulphurs or liquified Salts do dissolve Sulphurs or
sulphurous bodies, so do Resins (which are sulphurs and Salts) dissolve
Viscosities. 13. But whereas Salts passing quick, make but little impression,
do only dissolve what is found in the Stomach and Bowels, they therefore only
purge mildly; whereas Resins by reason of their viscous and tenacious particles
do remain a longer time in the body, causing a fermentation, not only about the
parts, where they are, but also draw from the Brain joints and other remote
parts, by which means phlegm and water is brought into the Bowels; so that these
latter purge more strongly. 14. By reason of this viscous and tenacious quality
in Resins, you must give this and other Resins always mixed with some other Body
(with the addition of a few drops of oil of Anniseeds) thereby to separate the
particles; for if it be taken alone, it is apt to adhere to the inward Membrane
of the Intestines, whereby if it cause not ulcers by its acrimonious quality,
yet it many times cause Convulsions, swoonings, and heart sickness, and
sometimes works two or three days together, to the almost ruin of the Patient.
15. It is best to be poudred and incorporated with some Electuary and a few
drops of oil of Anniseeds, for so it works safely and without pain: but if it
be given in a potion, you must first mix it with a little of the Yolk of an
Egg, for it sticks to the bottom of the Mortar like Turpentine, if it be
moistened with any watery body. 16. Given according to these Directions, it
purges by stool, without procuring Vomit, and operates much more gently than
the powder of Jallap taken in substance, because it is divested of its volatile
Salt, which is its sharpest part. It purges all cold, moist and phlegmatic
humors, and is a specific against the Gout, Scurvy Dropsy, Jaundice,
King's Evil, Leprosy, Scab and other contumacious Diseases, purging water from
all parts. If it be mixed with Salt of Tartar, and Mercurius dulcis, it will
operate yet more transcendently. 17. The Dose is a gr. iiij. ad xij. in Bolus,
Conserve, or some such like: and gr. xij. is said to work full as much as a
whole dram of the Jallop given in powder.

2. Magisterium, seu Resina Scammonij; Magistery or Resin of Scammony.

It is made as the former, from Jallap: Or as we have taught in our Pharmacop.
Lib. 1. Cap. 8. Sect. 68. where you have also a way of doing it with Vinegar.

It purges more gently than Scammony in substance, because it is divested of
much of its sharp volatile Salt, by Dissolution in the Menstruum, as also is
freed from the greatest part of its terrenity and faeces. This either alone or
mixed with Mercurius dulcis, is a truly noble Purge and gentle. It carries off
all Humors, and extirpateth the King's Evil, Scurvy, Dropsy, Jaundice, Gout,
Sciatica, Leprosy, Scabs, Itch, etc. It opens all Obstructions of the Liver,
Spleen, Gall and Womb, and mightily facilitates the cure of the French Pox:
Dose a gr. x. ad xv. in Bolus, Electuary, Conserve, etc.

3. Magisterium Magnum, The Great Magistery.

It is made of Oystershells levigated, as we have taught in our Pharmacop. Lib.
3. Cap. 13. Sect. 94. in the preparation of Pearl and Coral. But whereas we
there precipitate with Liquor of Tartar; in this, you may, if you so please,
precipitate with a great quantity of clear cold water, when stirring with a
wooden Spatula, the water will become at first white as Milk, and then the
Magistery will precipitate to the bottom, leaving the water clear and a little
acid. Put this water off, and affuse fresh, so doing till the Magistery is
perfectly sweetened, and water comes away insipid: put the powder upon white
paper (through which the remaining humidity will go) and set it to dry in the
shade, upon the bottom of a hair Sieve.

It has all the Virtues of that of Pearl, besides which, this is known to be
more powerful, as large experience has demonstrated. It is an admirable
Cordial, and strengthens the Balsam of Life: it helps Heart-burnings, resists
poison, pestilence and putrefaction; it eases pains, chears the Spirits, cools
inflammations, and is a general help in all Fevers. It is so famous, that the
strongest Agonies and greatest extremities, are suddenly, and as it were
miraculously remedied thereby. It preserves Health, and prolongs Life. Dose a
gr. x. ad j. or ss. And thus are prepared the Magisteries of Bones, Horns, and
other Shells.

4. Magisterium Putaminum Ovorum; Magistery of Egg-shells.

This is made as are the Magisteries of Pearl, Coral and Oyster shells, without
any difference. But here you are to observe, 1. That your Egg-shells be new,
clean and frree from dirt, that the spirit of the Vinegar may the easilier
fasten upon them: for any kind of filth does dissolve the action of the
dissolvant. 2. That you ought to have the shells of Eens Eggs, not of Ducks,
Geese, Turkers, or other water Fowl; because as these Birds are hotter, so
their shells are (by reason of their heat) harder, and so more difficult to be
dissolved, thereby requiring a greater quantity of the dissolvant. 3. That
spirit of Vinegar is here used, for simple Vinegar would not be strong enough
to cause a dissolution. Spirits of Sulphur or Niter, will admirably do the same
thing (but they are much dearer,) for that they produce a very white Calx: but
Spirit of Vitriol or Aquae Fortis are naugh for this work, spoiling the
Operation by communicating a blackness to the Magistery. 4. That this Magistery
is only Egg-shells philosophically Calcined by Spirit of Vinegar, then
precipitated by cold water into a white Calx, after sweetened by many Lotions,
and lastly dried, to be kept for use.

Given inwardly it prevails against the Stone and Gravel in both Reins and
Bladder, is said to take away Heart-burnings. Outwardly, it is a good
desicative, and drys up Ulcers without corrosion: therefore it is of singular
use for such Ulcers as happen to the Cornea Tunicle of the Eye. It is also a
good Fucus, for if you rub your Hands and Face with it, without mixing it with
any Pomatum, it so insinuates it self into the Pores, as to produce an
admirable whiteness.

5. Magisterium Corallorum Verum, The true Magistery of Coral.

Laevigated powder of the best red Coral iiij. put it into a large capacious
Mattress, put upon it softly, and by degrees, well rectified Spirit of Venus xx.
( whose preparation we have taught Cap. 2. Sect. 19. of this Book) the
ebulition and offervescency being over, put the Mattress to digest in a vaporous
Bath, the space of 24 hours, which past, filterate all the Liquor (in which all
the Coral will be dissolved, nothing of the Coral remaining but a terrene
impurity,) this filterated Liquor put into a Cucurbit in B. M. cover it with
its Head, and draw off the Spirit with such a heat, as that the drops may
leisurely follow one another; thus continue till the matter remains in the
bottom of the Vessel half dry; then put out the Fire, and keep the Spirit for
the like use again, it being still as good as at first, what remains wash with
Spanish Scorzonera water, and the second Cinnamon Water, A. viij. mixed
together; if this quantity of Water is not enough to perfect the Solution, take
so much as will do: put this mixture into a Cucurbit, then cover it, and place
it in B. M. drawing off the Waters to dryness: so have you a Cephalic Water,
and in the bottom of the Vessel a true Magistery, melting immediately in the
mouth, or in any Liquor it is put into.

1. Now here is to be noted, that in this preparation, no Spirit of Vinegar, or
the Body of any Salt is used to penetrate and open the Coral (for that they do
much diminish its power and virtues) but only the true Spirit of Venus, which
on the contrary does preserve and rather increase them. 2. That this Spirit is
volatile, active and penetrating, not operating as a corrosive (which indeed
will dissolve by gnawing, but thereby alter and destroy the virtues of the
matter.) It will reduce Coral and other Stones, as also Bones, Horns, Shells,
etc. to their first being or spermatick juice, without altring the goodness or
virtues of the things it operates upon; and this is apparent, for that this
admirable menstruum is drawn off again with the same taste, color, virtue and
dissolutive faculty which it had before, leaving nothing of it self behind. 3.
That the former Magisteries of Oyster-shells and Egg-shells being prepared with
this Spirit of Venus, would be of ten, yea an hundred times greater Virtues,
than when prepared with Spirit of Vinegar, by which they are a fixed and
astringent Earth. 4. That according to Paracelsus, in the sixth of his
Archidoxes, a true Magistery ought almost in a moment to penetrate our whole
Body, by the quickness of its motion, and subtilty of its parts; by which it is
manifest, that it is some thing else than a fixed Earth, incapable of any
action, much less of penetration, being destitute of all manner of salt and
spirit, whereby all actions and operations are performed. 5. The Cephalic
water aforesaid is an excellent Cordial, good against Epilepsies or
Convulsions, either in young or old. 6. The Magistery is replenished with
manifold and great virtues, being a most sovereign Cordial, and a specific
against Melancholy and madness. It is a great Remedy against the Scurvy, and
cleanses the whole mass of Blood from all impurities. It is a true preservative
against Malignant Diseases, because it strengthens so wonderfully the
Ventricle; it is prevalent against the French Pox, Smallpox Measles, Plague,
and other contagions, which this Magistery either stops or hinders, or
corrects, or otherwise evacuates, either sensibly or insensibly, to the health
and happiness of Mankind. 7. Its Dose is a gr. v. ad j. in Broth or Wine, or
rather in the aforesaid Cephalic and Cordial Water.

6. Magisterium de Gutta Gamba, Magistery of Cambogia.

Powder of Cambogia ij. S.V. viij. digest in B. M. two or three hours, decant
and filterate it hot, and by adding Rose Water precipitate, abstract the S.V.
and coagulate gently. Or thus; Cambogia ij. S.V vj Oil of Tartar j. digest and
dissolve in B.M.

It is said to have all the Virtues of the Crude Gums; but it works much more
pleasantly, safely, and gently. Dose a j. ad ss.

7. Magisterium, sen Sulphur Vitrioli abstersivus, Cleansing Sulphur of Vitriol.

choice Vitriol lbij. dissolve in Wine Vinegar, put it into an earthen Pot, dry
it over a gentle fire, increasing the fire by degrees, till the Vitriol has
been red hot an hour: put the Vitriol (being cold) into another Pot, put more
Vinegar upon it, let it boil a little, then put a quart of Water to it, which
boil half away: let it stand a little, and decant this red Water, which
reserve: on the Faeces put another quart of Water, boil it half away, till it
is tingedred, let it stand a little, and decant off this red Water to the
former reserved Water: this Work repeat so often, till the Vitriol will tinge
no more Water. These reserved waters put into a glass Vesica, and evaporate to
dryness. The solid Tincture at bottom (in a new pot) make red hot, then cast it
into a quart of Ram Water to dissolve; evaporate till the water grows red,
which decant and reserve: on the Faeces put fresh water, boil and decant, etc.
repeating this Work, till the water will be no more tinged: then cast away the
Foeces, and evaporate these reserved waters to dryness; so have you a red
abstersive Sulphur of Vitriol, which will be sweet on the Tongue.

It is exceeding abstersive or cleansing, stops bleeding, heals, and is of
great use in all Wounds and Ulcers. It is chiefly intended for Wurtz his
Composition of the Vnguentum Fuscum, or brown Ointment.

8. Magisterium, seu Crocus Metallorum Absinthiacus Mynsichti; Crocus of
Metals, with Salt of Wormwood.

Crude Antimony, Salt of Wormwood. A. iiij. mix, fire and calcine dilligently,
and with care, till the Antimony is somewhat red, and divested of its arsenical
Sulphur, then dulcify it by washing in fair water, till no acrimony is
perceived, dry it, and keep it for use.

It has all the virtues of both the ordinary Crocus and Vitrum, and is given in
infusion in Canary or Cinnamon Water, a gr. iij. ad v. you may infuse for one
night in ij. or iij. of the Vehicle you intend. This is that Crocus which is
made use of in making the Emetick Salt of Tartar, in Cap. 10. Sect. 7.
following.

9. Magisterium, seu Sulphur Antimonij per Calcinationem, Magistery or Sulphur
of Antimony by calcination.

Niter vj. Antimony iiij. Common Salt i ss. Charcole ss. being all in fine
powder, mix, and fire in a strong large Crucible: after the detonation is over,
dugment the fire, that the Antimony may be thoroughly melted, this done, with a
pair of Tongs take the Crucible out, and gentle shake or knock it at bottom; so
will the Regulus or Metal of the Antimony fall to the bottom, and the soft sine
Sulphur remain at top; let it stand till it is cold, then separate the Sulphur
and Regulus, keeping each for their several uses.

This Sulphur is a good thing to remove any kind of Obstruction in the Stomach,
Liver and Spleen; it prevents and takes away Cachexies, Green Sickness, Gouts,
running Gouts, Melancholy, Dropsies, Jaundice, Fevers, etc. Dose a gr. iiij.
ad viij. in any convenient mixture. The Prescript is not much unlike to that
which we have delivered in Our Pharmacop. Lib. 3. Cap. 8. Sect. 65. where you
have also the Virtues of the Regulus.

10. Magisterium, sen, Antimonium Resuscitatum, Antimony Revived.

of the best Hungarian Antimony, Sal Armoniack, A. grind them well together in
a mortar, and sublime them into yellow and red flowers. Take these flowers, put
them into a Bolt-Head, and affuse upon them Spirit of Vinegar so much as to
overtop them, the breadth of four fingers: digest 8 or 10 days, and abstract
the Liquor by distillation or evaporation; grind the whitish calx, and
edulcorate with warm water, by which it will be reduced to its pristin color,
having lost its malignity, and poison.

This Dr. Gideon Harvey commends as a gentle Vomitory, Dejectory, and
Diaphoretick; accommodated to all Ages, Sexes and Climes; radically, curing all
Oppilations, Fevers, Dropsies, the Jaundice, Asthma, Ph^hisis in beginning,
Convulsions in Children, but more particularly Agues in them, obstructon of the
Courses in Women. Dose a gr. iiij. ad x xij. or j. if the sick be strong.

11. Magisterium Specificum Antimonij Helmontij, Helmonts Specific Purge.

crude Antimony, Sal Armoniack finely poudred, A. xij. sublime the combustible
red flowers, according to Art. Of these flowers take viij. fine Niter xvj. let
them fulminate in subliming pots, and gather the flowers without any wast;
dulcify them with hot water, till there is no more saltness remaining. Upon
this powder (dried over a soft fire) put rectified S. V. four fingers breadth
above it; then put all into an Alembick with its Receiver luted to it,
distilling at first with a gentle fire, after increasing it, distill to dryness,
being perfectly dry, expose it to the fire for an hour, and keep it for use.

This preparation of Antimony provokes Sweat strongly, and being taken fasting
in a morning; or 2 or 3 hours after Supper, at night going to bed in some
Bolus, Conserve, or Cordial Water, a gr. xx. ad ss. it gently loosens the
Belly, being a specific Purge. If taken in a less quantity, it sweats only.

12. Magisterium Antifebrile Antimonij, An Antimonial Magistery against Fevers.

Cinnabar of Antimony ijss. Salt decripitated v. powder and mix them together
put them into a glass Cucurbit, upon which put Oil of Sulphur iiij. digest two
or three days in a gentle sand heat; then increase the heat to the evaporating
away the superfluous humidity: wash what remains, dry it, powder it, and mix it
with slos sulphuris iiij. which set over burning Coals, in an earthen ^^sh,
stir it continually with an Iron Spatula, till the flowers are consumed, then
put upon it S.V. to overtop it two singers breadth, which when consumed by
burning, the remaining mass dry, powder, and keep it for use.

It cures all intermitting Fevers and Agues, taken (half an hour before the
Fit) a gr. xij. ad j. in some Cordial Syrup; drinking a little Broth two hours
after: purge before you use it, and repeat it three or four times, it works
chiefly by Sweat.

13. Magisterium Sacchari Saturni, Magistery of the Sugar of Saturn.

Saccharum Saturni ij. Spirit of Vinegar, fair Water, A. lbij. dissolve, and
put upon it, drop by drop, Oleum Tartari, per deliquium, and the Magistery will
precipitate white; boil them a little, then filerate through brown Paper, and
the white powder will remain in the Cane, which sweeten by many Lotions in fair
water.

It drys much, and heals running sores, in Pomatum it is good against Tettars,
etc, but is most commonly used for a Fucus or Paint.

14. Magisterium Jovis, Magistery of Jupiter.

Flowers of Tin, dissolve them in a sufficient quantity of water, which filter,
and drop upon it guttatim Spirit of Sal Armoniack, Or Oil of Tartar, per
deliquium, and at bottom you will have a very white precipitate, sweeten it by
many ablutions in warm water, then dry it keep it from the Air in a glass close
stopped.

1. But before you can perfectly make this Magistery, you ought to know how to
make the Sublimatum Jovis, which is as follows: Tin, Sal Armoniach, both in
powder, A. mix them well together, which put into a strong earthen Cucurbit,
able to endure the Fire: fit to it a blind head, luting well the juncture,
place the Cucurbit on a grate, in a small Furnace, with an open fire, but only
so as that the fire may pass through the Registers, for which end stop up the
top of the Furnace with Brick and Lute, but leaving Registers at pleasure. Let
the Vessel be placed in the Furnace, about a third part of its height: give a
small fire at first, and increase it by degrees, till the bottom of the
Cucurbit is red hot, continue such a fire till nothing more will sublime, which
you may know by the growing cold of the blind Head: the Vessels being cold,
unlute them, so will the flowers stick to the Head and Top of the Cucurbit,
which is some part of the Tin clevated with the Sal Armoniack: but at the
bottom of the Cucurbit you will find some of the Tin revived. 2. The Tin is
brought to a powder, by putting it into a large earthen Pot or Pan unglased,
putting it also over a Fire to melt, and then stirring it with a Spatula, till
it comes into a brown or grevish powder. 3. This Magistery of Tin is an
admirable Fucus, for being mixed with Pomatum, it makes a delicate white. 4. It
is also to be noted that the Tin in the sublimation is dissolved by the acid of
the Sal Armoniack; but in its praecipitation by the Alcali^ thereof; for the
Spirit of Sal Armoniack is an Alcalie as well as the Oil of Tartar; which is
the reason that it destroys the force of the acid, and making it let go its
hold, causes the Precipitation.

15. Magisterium Marcasitae ex floribus, Magistery of Bismuth from its flowers.

Flowers of Bismuth or Tinglass, dissolve them in water, and precipitate with
Spirit of sal Armoniack, or Oil of Tartar. Or thus, Dissolve in a Mattress
Bismuth j; with spirit of Niter j; put this Dissolution into a clean white-ware
Vessel; put upon it lb vj. of water, in which sea salt j. was beforehand
melted, so will a White praecipitate fall to the Bottom: Decant the water,
sweeten the Magistery by many Lotions, then dry it.

1. Here is to be noted, That Bismuth may be brought to a powder by beating in
a Mortar, or by calcining it as you did Tin, at sect. 14. 2. aforegoing. 2.
That the flowers are made of that calcined powder, by mixing it with equal
parts of Sal Armoniack, and then subliming as you did Tin in the former
Section. 3. That the Praecipitate made with Niter is an excellent Cosmetick,
called Spanish-white, and serves to whiten the Skin, being mixed with Pomatum or
Rose water. 4. That j of this Magistery is mixed with j of Pomatum, or jv of
water, so used, it softens and whitens the skin, and is good against the Itch,
or any Itching humor, because it destroys those Acids or Salts which cause it.

16. Magisterium seu Ar. canum Mercurii Vitae Paracelsi; The Mercury of Lise of
Pacelsus.

Mercury essentisicated, the which separate from all its superfluities, as the
pure from the impure: afterward sublime it with Antimony, so that they may
both of them ascend and be made one: then let them be resolved upon a Marble
and be coagulated; and do thus even four times; which being sinish'd, thou
shall have the Mercurius Vitae by us so often mentioned.

Paracelsus commends this Arcanum to the Skies, and that it has the Power, not
only of Transmuting of Persons, but of other things, and the renewing of every
growing thing out of the old Quality into a new. So it reduces Mars into the
first Matter; and does so again transmute it, that it is made Iron again. After
the same manner it renews Gold likewise, the which it reduces into its proper
Mercury and Tincture; and again digesteth it into Gold, so as to become a Metal
like the former. It operates in like manner with Growing things, if their roots
be perfused or moistened therewith, they will bring forth flowers and fruits a
second time: if when the first-seed shall fall off, they be at that time
moistened with the same, as above: they will produce second flowers, and fruits
without any respect of time. The same is to be understood of men and Beasts, to
whom if this Mercury be given, it renovates all their old and consumed members,
and restores their deficient and lost Virtues into the youthfull-like body or
habitation; insomuch that the Menstrua and Blood do as naturally flow in old
women as in the young, and reduces her old Age into the like perfection of
Nature, as when she was young: insomuch that youth is increased thereby, and so
the Age is renewed. But you are to understand me thus, Not that this Arcanum
excites a new Essence (as some Maliciously interpret our Meaning:) but that the
Essence and youthful spirit, from whence the Juvenile virtues do proceed, do
remain unconsumed, although by being oppressed, it might be accounted for dead:
and therefore our Mercurius Vitae, separates the Impurity, whereby it comes to
pass, that the old life does most efficaciously recover its virtues: and it
perfects its operations after a wonderful manner, viz. in casting off the Nail,
of hands or feet, and by rooting out gray hairs; it strengthens youth, in so
much that Corruption cannot come to that height as to discover old age, by
those signs attending it: for this cause we have discovered it to Chemists in a
very few words (for it is needless to write much) but as for foolish
pretenders, they are hence excluded.

17. Magisterium Metallorum Paracelsi, Paracelsus his Magistery of Metals.

Circulatum purged excellently well yea to the highest essence; whereto put the
thinnest metalline leaves, or s^ings of any Metal you please, excellently and
most subtly wrought and mundified: these two being put together in a
sufficient weight, must be circulated for four weeks, and the leaves will be
reduced by this temperate medium into an Oil, and into a form of Fatness
swimming at top, and colored according to the Condition of thee Metal, the
which you shall separate by a silver drawer from the Circulatum. This therefore
is potable Gold or Silver, etc. The like may also be extracted from other
Metals, and may be taken in drink, or with your food without any detriment.

1. What this Circulatum is, we shall in some other place declare, however this
know, That the Process must be done without any Corrosive; or any of those
complexionated things, which are contrary to the Metals. 2. And, whereas great
Regard is to be had to their agreement and affinity, therefore the temperate
alone is suitable thereunto. But you are to know what that temperate thing is: a
temperate, a complexioned thing or body, this does receive the other into it
self, and is incorporated into that whereto it shall be adjoined; so that it
does no more discover the old, and its own Complexion, but the Virtues of that
body only, which shall be added unto it. 3. Thus indeed Vinum ardens, or
inflamable S.V. has in it a full and perfect Complexion, yet it does not (as I
may so speak) complexionate that which is put into it; but does so perfect its
operation, according to the Virtues of that Body which was put therein. And
therefore seeing it does thus attract the Virtues of another, and tame its own,
it is for this Reason, said to be temperate, and is deservedly so called. 4.
Out of any thing that is like to this, may be made a Magistery; so that the
Virtues of the Metals may pass into that same temperate thing, and may be
mundisied and purified therewith, and be distilled even to their limit or end;
such-alike Magistery after it shall be perfected, shall be called Potable,
because it may be taken in drink; whence it comes to pass, That the Magistery
of Gold is called Aurum Potablic, and that of Silver Argentum potabile, and so
of Iron, Lead, Quicksilver, etc. they may be made potable, and so called, and
be described according to their own Complexions: and according to those
processes, they have far greater Operations than is expedient for us to write
of. 5. After this manner, with one temperate Medium, and one process, by way of
Practice may all the Magisteries of the seven Metals be made.

18. Magisterium de Gemmis Paracelsi, Magistery of Precious stones.

Gems, grind or beat them, calcine them in a Reveratory with Sal Niter, A. burn
them excellently well into a Calx: after wash them with burning wine, so long
until there be found no more superfluous matter: After washing, calcine again
and proceed in all respects as before; and so the whole essence will pass into
the burning wine; Evaporate this by Ebulition, so shall thou have an Alcalie,
the which being resolved into a Water keep.

1. There is no reason that thou should abhor the Use hereof how acute or
calcineous soever it be; for it is by that acuity alone, that it operates upon
that which resists it; and it is so subtle that one only drop, tingeth the
whole body into a singular Virtue. 2. This Magistery out of precious stones is
to be understood after the same manner as that out of Metals; as to Virtues,
which each stone has according to its nature: but for stones there needs no
temperate Medium, or any kind of Addition; because their Solution is not the
same with that of Metals; but from this general process of Gems are excepted
those of Pearl and Coral.

19. Magisterium succini Paracelsi, Paracelsus his Magistery of Amber.

Levigated Amber, as much as you please, and of the Circulatum so much as is
sufficient; digest them in a flat bottomed Vessel in Ashes for six days, then
let the Circulatum be destilled thence, and be poured on again, the which let
be done so often, until there be found an oil in the bottom, the which Oil is
the Magistery of Amber.

It has all the Virtues of Amber, its subtle Oil and volatile Salt are much
more pleasant to be taken. This (says Paracelsus) has disclosed to us its
wonderful virtues, may it so remain.

20. Magisterium herbarum Paracelsi, Paracelsus his Magistery of Herbs.

of Herbs what quantity you please, permix them with burning wine, and putresy
them therewith for a month; then distill them by B. M. and cohobate the
distilled Liquor upon the faeces or Caput Mortuum; which often iterate till the
whole quantity of the burning wine, be four times less than the juyces of the
Herbs: Distill the same by a Pelican with new additaments for one Month, then
separate it, having so done, you have the Magistery of the matter or herb
desired.

After the same manner are you to make the Magisterys of Flowers.

21. Magisterium Vini Paracelsi, Paracelsus his Magistery of Wine.

of the oldest Wine, q.v. the best that can be gotten both for Color and taste,
put it into a glass Vessel, so that a third part thereof may be full, and shut
it with Hermes seal; and keep it in horse dung in a continued heat for four
Months; not letting the heat be defective. This done, in the Winter time, when
the cold and frost are extremely sharp, set it abroad in the Cold for a Month,
that it may be congeased, so will the Cold force the spirit of Wine, together
with its substance, into the Center of the wine, and separate it from the
Phlegm. That which is congealed or froz'n cast away, but that which is not
congealed is the spirit with its substance: this put into a Pelican in sand,
which digest with a gentle heat for some time; so shall you have the Magistery
of Wine.

This differs much from the Spirit of Wine, for there the Essence is wanting;
here you have the whole essence of Wine with the Spirit.

22. Magisterium Sanguinis Paracelsi, Paracelsus his Magistery of Blood.

Blood, let it be shut up in a Pelican, and so long transcend or rise up, upon
the horse belly (or dunghill) until the third part of the Pelican be filled;
for all blood in its rectification is dilated, according to the Quantity, and
not according to the Weight: this time being finished, rectify it by a B.M. by
this way the Phlem will separate, and the Magistery remain in the bottom, the
which being shut up in a retort with Hermes seal, distill it 9 times; so have
you the Magistery of blood.

Here some may say, That the Blood when it is let out of the Veins, is deprived
of those Virtues necessarily, that renew and sustain the Blood: but this is not
so; for it may be conserved in the Essence, as we have even now taught. But it
ought to be the Blood of a found Animal; or, of one that is brought into a
renewed Quality and Essence, by Arcana's and Quintessences, that the Blood may
thereby flow from them sound and incorrupt. There is in like manner the blood of
Bread, and of other Comestible things, which is in like manner to be taken for
the same use; for there are therein such Virtues as are scarce to be searched
out by us, nor will we undertake the burden of doing it to its highest worth.

CHAP. X. Of SALTS.
1. SAL seu Saccarum Saturni ex Lithargyro, Salt of Lead from Litharge.

spirit of Vinegar, q. v. put it into a glazed Earthen pan, over a fire of
Coals and dry wood, till it begins to simper: then put to it Litharge of Gold
or Silver in fine powder, q. s. stir it continually with a stick: when its
boiled a little, take off the Pan, and let the Vinegar settle a while, and
while warm decant it: after put more Vinegar upon the Litharge, boil and
decant, as before, so ding till all the Litharge is dissolved: these
dissolutions filterate while warm over a glass Cucurbit in a sand heat (up to
the neck in Sand) and evaporate the humidity, till the remainder becomes red as
blood, and is covered with a Pellicule or little skin: then put it out into
little white dishes, where let it cool: so will a great part of the Liquor
shoot into Crystals, like needles, white and sweet as Sugar. Power off from the
Liquid part, viz. a red Oil, and a Sugar of Saturn uncrystallized: taking also
out the Crystals, which keep in a glass Vial well stopped, lest other wise they
should fall into a Calx.

1. Here is to be noted, that some make use of Ceruse instead of Litharge, but
experience shows that Litharge is better, for that having passed the sire of
the Copel, it is a more spongy open body, and therefore more penetrable by the
Spirit of Vinegar, and so will yield a greater quantity of Salt: but next after
Litharge you may use Ceruse, then Minium, which is Ceruse made red in a
Reverberatory fire. 2. If by chance in evaporating the Dissolutions you go
beyond the Pellicule, so as the matter begins to look thick and glutinous, you
will then have no Crystals; and therefore you may evaporate it, and make the
Salt without Crystalization. 3. Of the red glutinous Oil of Saturn, you may
make a Magistery of Saturn, by putting to it an equal quantity of the Spirit of
Sulphur; so will the dissolution of Saturn turn into white Curds, which by
little and little, will precipitate to the bottom in white powder, which
sweeten by but once washing in fair water, because it is apt to dissolve in the
water. 4. That you ought to take glased earthen pan, not a stone or glass one,
because these latter would break; and for the Lead of the other, there is no
danger of its being coroded by the Vinegar, because it is so hard burnt to the
Earth; but should it corode it, the matter is not great, for the glasing of
those earthen things is made of Lead. 5. That the Vinegar ought to boil before
the Litharge goes in, that it might the more suddenly fill its body with the
Saturn, letting it boil after but a very little time, which will be enough to
impregnate the Vinegar with the Salt of the Lead. 6. That if you would have
your Salt extreme white, you must dissolve it in equal quantities of Spirit of
Vinegar and common water; then filterate and Cristalize as aforesaid; which
work you may repeat 3 or 4 times as aforesaid. 7. That the ebulition which is
raised is caused from the forcible entrance of the Acids, whereby they
violently separate the parts of the matter: in this esservescency (as in others
of like kind) there is not the least degreee of heat to be perceived, but
rather cold is increased, and the Vinegar losing its acidity, acquires a kind
of sweetness. 8. We here use Spirit of Vinegar for a dissolvant, a stronger is
not necessary, because Lead is a soft Metal: but simple Vinegar, by reason of
its Fiegm is both unfit and too weak. 9. By reiterated additions of fresh
Spirit, all the Litharge will be dissolved, but you must repeat till the whole
dissolution is completed. 10. This Salt of Lead is not a true simple Salt, but
a Dissolution of the substance of Lead by Acids, which do very closely Unite
with it, to make a kind of Salt: this is proved by distillation, for if you
draw off the humidity, you will have only an insipid water. 11. You must stir
it only with a wooden Instrument, for Iron (as well as its Vitriol) would
blacken it, and so spoil the beauty of the Salt. 12. In making the Magistery at
3. above, the precipitation is with Spirit of Sulphur, because it makes a
whiter and sweeter precipitate, than any other Acid, not only in this, but in
all other Magisteries. The Spirit of Vitriol is said to blacken: Spirit of Salt
would be apt to fix with the Magistery; Spirit of Niter is too sharp: Oil of
Tartar has an unpleasant taste of Urine. 13. This Saccharum may be revived again
into Lead, by mixing it with an alcalious Salt, melted in a Crucible over a
good sire; because this Salt destroys the Acids that thus metamorphosed the
Lead: but it will be inflamed before it revives, by reason of the Spirit of
Wine, which was locked or shut up in the Vinegar. 14. The Virtues. It is good
against the Chollick, Plague, violent Fevers, heat and pain in the Reins,
Bladder and Secrets, and all inward Inflammations, being given in Wine, Sherry
Sack, Aqua Mirabilis, or Cinnamon Water. It quenches Lust, abates Venereal
desires, cures old cancerous, corrosive and malign Ulcers, as Cancers, Woolf,
Noli me Tangere, Ring-worms, Tettars, sore Throats and Mouths, Burns, Scalds,
red Pimples, etc. It is good against the Bloody Flux, stops the overflowing of
the Terms, and Haemorrhoids, which are usually caused by a flux of sharp Salts
to those Vessels and Bowels. But it is said particularly that it is a great
specific in Quinseys, being inwardly taken, forasmuch as that Disease is
thought by some to proceed from a Salt or acid serosity, falling too abundantly
on the Muscles of the Larynx, thereby raising a fermentation, which dilates the
Fibers, and causes an Inflammation, so that what is able to dull the edge of
those Acids, is thought good against that Disease. 15. The Dose is from gr.
iiij. to viij. in any of the Vehicles aforesaid.

2. Sal seu Crystali Martis Sulphurati, Salt of Iron with Oil of Sulphur.

Filings of Steel or opening Crocus, drop on it Oil of Sulphur, melt and add
hot water, filter and abstract a little, then set it to Crystallize, purify the
Crystals by solution and coagulation. Or thus, opening Crocus lb vj. levigated:
put it into boiling water lbxxiiij. by spoonfuls, stirring it continually for
two hours, with an Iron Spatula, till the water be half boiled away; then,
while warm, filterate through brown Paper, after evaporate to the Pelicule,
then set it in a cool place to Crystallize; in two days you will have many
green transparent Crystalls sticking to the sides and bottom: then boil again
and Crystallize, doing so till all the Crystals are gathered, which keep in a
glass close stopped: the powder of Mars remaining in the filter will serve to
make the astringent Crocus.

1. Now here is to be noted, that the salt of Mars cannot be gotten, unless the
body be first well opened, with Brimstone and a Reverberatory fire, by which
the opening Crocus is made, for the Salt and Spirit of Sulphur calcines and
opens the Metal. 2. That although the boiling water has force enough to extract
the Salt out of the Crocus Martis aperitivus, yet it will be more easily done,
to add to every pound of water ss, or j, of the Oil of Sulphur. 3. That this
Salt or Crystals will be of a transparent green color, because Mars is
generated in a Vitriolick Earth, or an Earth containing nothing but pure
Vitriol. 4. That these Crystals are nothing but the Salt of Mars, extracted out
of the opening Crocus and Crystallized. 5. Some make these Crystalls thus. S.V.
rectified, Oil of Vitriol, A. xxx. put into it thin Iron Plates, or filings of
Iron iiij. or vj. set it some time in the Sun, then in the shade without
stirring it, so will the Liquor be incorporated with the Mars, and make a Salt
that you must dry, and keep in a Vial close stopped. 6. This Salt is a great
opener and true restorer of the Liver and Spleen, being an admirable Remedy for
all Diseases proceeding from Obstruction: it Cures the Cachexy, Dropsy, and
green sickness. Its virtue is greater than that of the opening Crocus, because
that it is sharpened by the acids of the Vitriol, and therefore is to be given
in a less Dose. It provokes the Terms, and is excellent against the yellow
Jaundice, and all Leprous breakings out in the Skin. Dose a gr. iiij. ad xij.
But if you make it with water alone, without the Acid Oils, you may give from
j. ad j. in Broth or Syrup; and in case of the Stoppage of the Terms and
Green Sickness, it may be given with j. of the Extract of Savin. After the same
manner are made Crystals of the Calx of Jupiter.

3. Sal, seu Crystalli Argentei, Salt or Crystals of Silver.

Cupellated Silver, viz. without Alloy ij. best Spirit of Niter vj. dissolve,
and put the Dissolution into a glass Cucurbit, over a gentle Sand heat:
evaporate about a quarter of the humidity: and let the rest cool without
stirring of it; so will it shoot into Crystals, which separate from the Liquor,
dry them, and keep them in a glass close stopped. The remaining liquor evaporate
again, and set it to Crystallize as before: these evaporations and
Crystallizations so often repeat, till all the Silver is turned into Crystalls.

1. Here you are to note, not only in this, but in all Crystallizations, that
you leave not too much moisture, for fear of too much weakening the Salts,
thereby hindering the Crystallizing: Nor must you leave too little moisture, for
then the Crystalls (not finding room enough) cannot shoot or extend themselves,
but will fall confusedly one upon another. 2. You must be sure to put your
silver into a Mattress large enough, then pour on your Spirit of Niter. Aqua
fortis, it is true, will serve well enough, but Spirit of Niter acts with more
celerity: the Mattress you must place in Ashes, or a Sand heat to hasten the
Dissolution. 3. When the Spirits begin to gnaw the Silver, an ebulition
presently rises, with an esservescency, and a considerable heat; which heat is
caused by the violence of the motion, and impetuous segregation of the parts,
being ratified: this esservescency or vapor, you must carefully avoid, as a
thing very unwholsom and hurtful to the Breast and Lungs, as also to the Brain;
it will remain till the Silver is all dissolved; after which the Liquor will
become transparent and clean. 4. What evaporates in order to Cryallization is
little better than insiped wter, for the acid spirit or salt remains fixed with
the Silver, whereby these Crystals weigh more than the Silver of which they are
made. 5. These Crystalls will dissolve in water like Salt, because they are
incorporated with the Salt or Spirit of the Niter, and by reason of these
spirits it is, that the Crystalls gnaw and corrupt the flesh (as a Caustic) to
which they are applied, thereby making an Escar: it is they likewise which make
you purge, being given inwardly, because by their pricking they stir up a
fermentation of Humors. 6. You may reduce them into Silver again, if you put
them into warm water, and lay therein a plate of Copper, for thereby the Silver
will precipitate to the bottom, in a white powder, which being washed and
dried, and then melted in a Crucible, with a little Salt Peter, you may cast it
into an Ingot of the same weight as before. 7. The Virtues. They are wonderful
strengthners of the Brain, comfort the Animal Spirits, cure the Epilepsy,
Apoplexy, Vertigo, Megrim, old Head-achs, Suffocation and other Diseases of the
Womb. It is also given inwardly, as a powerful remedy against Dropsies, purging
gently a gr. ij. ad vj. in some specific water: outwardly it is used to make
Eschars, by touching or applying it to the part.

4. Sal Fraxini, Salt of the wood of Ash.

It is made according to the common Rule, for fixed or Elementary Salts.

It opens all Obstructions, heals Wounds, cleanses the Reins and whole Body
of Salt and sharp humors, cures the Jaundice, Dropsy, Itch and Scab: some say,
it cures poison, malign Fevers, and all sorts of Epidemical and Pestilential
Diseases; as also the Rickets in Children, and the Green Sickness in Virgins.
Dose ad j. or more in Rhenish Wine, or Canary.

5. Sal Acetosae Essentiale, The Essential Salt of Sorrel.

Juice of Sorrel at such time as it runs up to seed, purify it; and then put it
into a glass Cucurbit, and in a sand heat, distill off from it two thirds of the
humidity: the remainder strain through a linen bag, to separate it from the
Faeces: then putting the clear juice into a clean glass Cucurbit, distill again
in B. M. till the Juice be of the thickness of a Rob, setting it in a cool
Cellar to Crystallize, which in a few days will be don, the Crystals sticking
to the bottom and sides of the Cucurbit. The Liquor that Swims above the Salt,
put into another Cucurbit, which evaporate as aforesaid in B.M. and again set
it in a Cellar to Crystallize. Lastly take these Salts, and dissolve them in
the aforesaid distilled water (to make them the more pure) and then Crystalize
anew, as we have taught in our Pharm. Land. lib. 6. Cap. 15. Sect. 6.

This Salt contains the Essential part of the Sorrel; cuts, attenuates, and
opens Obstructions of the Liver, Spleen and Bowels; helps digestion and causes
a good Appetite. It abates the heat of Fevers, and resists putrefaction of the
humors. Dose a j. ad j. in any convenient Vehicle.

6. Sal Tartari Compositum, Soluble Cream of Tartar.

Cream of Tartar, dissolve it in a sufficient quantity of warm water, then drop
in Oil of Tartar per deliquium, till the ebulition ceases; after which
evaporate the humidity to dryness.

It gently loosens the Belly, abates the heat of Fevers, strengthens the
stomach, and opens Obstructions: give it morning, noon, and night: ab ss ad ss.

7. Sal Tartari Emeticum Mynsichti, Emetick Salt of Tartar.

Cremor Tartari, Crocus Metallorum (made with Salt of Wormwood, and not freed
from the Salt) A. ij. powder them finely, and digest in a Vial close stopped)
with Mother of Time Water lbij. for three or four days, in a gentle sand-heat,
often shaking of it: then increasing the fire, unstop it, and let it boil
gently: filterate and evaporate, till a thin skin covers it; after which set it
in a cold place to Crystallize.

Mynsicht declares this to be the best of all Emeticks, operating with a great
deal of safety and gentleness: It cures all old pains of the Head, Frenzy,
Madness, Carus, Lethargy, Vertigo, Epilepsy, Apoplexia, Melancholy, weakness of
Memory, Witchcraft, noise of the Ears, difficulty of Hearing, Vomiting, Wind in
the Stomach, pains of the sides, the Pleurisy, yellow Jaundice, Dropsy, putrid
and acute Fevers, continual and intermitting Quartans; It is also profitable
against the Dysentery, and the contagious venom of the Pest; the Phthisick,
Asthma, Catarrh, spitting of Blood, inveterate Obstructions of the Mesentery,
Liver and Spleen; as also Scirrhous Tumors in any part of the body: Dose a gr.
ij. ad vj. in Broth, Wine, etc.

8. Sal Chalybiatum; Steeled Salt.

Salt of Vitriol (extracted from its Caput Mort.) iij. Sal Prunellae ij.
Vitriol of Mars j. powder each finely, and mix them; put all into a glass Gourd
in a sand heat, with a gradual fire, augmenting it till the matter looks red,
flows like water, and at last turns to a red hard Stone.

It is prevalent against Cachexies, Scurvies, Corruption and Putrefaction of
the Blood, Catarrhs, Dropsies, Obstructions of the Liver, Spleen, and Stomach:
it carries off ill humors by Stool, Urine, Sweat, and insensible transpiration.
Dose a gr. viij. ad j. in Broth or other proper Vehicle.

9. Sal Diureticum, Salt provoking Urine.

Urine of a sound Man, put into it as much Hungarian Vitriol in powder, as the
Urine will dissolve: make the Dissolution in a large Vessel, that there may be
room for ebulition; which ceasing, put the Liquor into a glass Cucurbit,
covered with its head: draw off the Phlegm and Spirit in a Sand heat, first mith
a slow fire, then increasing it by degrees, the Volatile Salt will at last
sublime.

This Salt powerfully expells ferous humors, by Urine: opens all manner of
Obstructions, is good against the Dropsy and Jaundice, and carries off by Urine
all manner of malign and scorbutic Humors: Dose a j. ad j. in Rhenish Wine,
some Diuretic water, or in ordinary drink. This Salt is a Composition of the
Volatile Salt of Urine, mixed with the acid Particles of the Vitriol. The Phlegm
outwardly applied gives ease in the Gout.

10. Sal Armoniacum Sublimatum; Salt Armoniack sublimed.

the Scoria made with Antimony, Tartar and Niter (when you make Regulus of
Antimony, per se,) make a Lixivium of it, which filterate and boil to the
consistency of Honey; and by degrees of heat bring it to a fixed Salt; which
Salt grind well with fine Sal Armoniack (which has been first dissolved in
Distilled water, filterated and coagulated) being well ground together, put
them to sublime, first, there will come over a little Spirit; then will the Sal
Armoniack sublime in flowers; this you must do seven times, every time with
fresh Fixed Salt of the Scoria.

This sublimed Sal Armoniack is a powerful specific in the Gout, so that sew
things can equal it: let it be dissolved in Wine, dip a Linen cloth in it, and
put it upon the affected place, which moisten with a Sponge so often as it
drys, for 12 hours or more: it generally cures at once or twice using: inwardly
you may also give it in Wine or Ale, a gr. iiij. ad x. letting the sick sweat
upon it. It opens all Obstructions, provokes Urine and the Terms, perfectly
removes Crudities from the stomach, and very happily cures Quartans, and all
other putrid Fevers, Gangreens, Mortifications, etc.

11. Sal, seu Vitriolum Martij Riverij, Riverius his Salt of Iron.

Oil of Vitriol, or of Sulphur lb ss. S.V. lbj. mix them in a new Iron pot that
is clean, and cover it well: within 15 days there will be a Salt-like
gathering, which set in the Sun, and dry it thoroughly, stirring it sometimes
with an Iron Spatula: In winter dry it upon a gentle fire, or in Sand, or a
warm Oven. Being dry, keep the Salt in a close Glass, for being exposed to the
Air, it turns moist.

It is a most admirable thing against the most contumacious obstructions of the
Liver and Spleen, or of any other part of the body: It is said to be a perfect
cure. for Hypocondriack Melancholy, for which Riverius commends it above all
other Medicines. Dose a gr. xij. ad j. it may be given in Wine, or other
Liquor, Or Syrup, or Conserve, or made into Pills with Mucilage of Gum
Tragacanth. It is to be used long, viz. for a month or two, which you cannot do
without great profit. It is also a Specific in the cure of the Scurvy and of
the Green Sickness.

12. Sal Succini Volatile, Volatile Salt of Amber.

The Salt of Amber, which is very volatile and piercing, is attained after a
various manner, and by various Operations. I. By the Distillation of the Oil,
as we have taught in our Pharmacop. Lib. 4. Cap. 3. Sect. 39. where part of the
Volatile Salt sticks to the Neck of the Retort, in form of little Crystals,
which are to begathered, and being puristed by solution, filteration, and
coagulation are to be kept for use. II. By evaporation of the spirituous part
or liquor, and setting it to Crystalize, which is done by putting that
spirituous saline liquor, first silterated, (mentioned in Our Pharm. Lib. 3.
Cap. 12. Sect. 51.) into a glass Cucurbit; placed in a sand-heat, over a small
fire, and evaporating about three quarters of the superfluous humidity, and
then setting it to Crystalize in some cold place: this evaporation and
crystalization you must continue, till the whole Salt, contained in the Liquor
is shot into Crystals, which gather together, and keep for use. III. By
separation from the Oil, thus: Take the Oil, put it into a great Mattress or
blind Head, upon which put its equal or somewhat greater quantity of distilled
Rain Water, cover and lute the Vessel: digest in a moderate ash or sand heat
(stirring it every bour) when you see the water well impregnated, remove the
fire, separate the water from the Oil, and filterate the water, which is full
of the volatile Salt of Amber, as you may perceive by its acid and biting taste;
then evaporate three parts of the water, and set it to Crystalize as the
former; in the space of two days the volatile Salt will be Crystalized into a
red brown substance, which separate from the Water, and dry between two papers,
in a moderate heat: in this manner evaporate and Crystalize the remaining part
of the Water, till all the Salt is drawn forth, which put together and keep for
use. If you would have it white, put it into a small Cucurbit, covered with a
blind Still-head, and sublime it in sand, with a good degree of heat, so will
it arise white and pure, leaving all its impurity in the bottom of the Vissel.

This Salt is the essential part of the Amber, of exceeding great virtues, and
indeed much transcends either the Spirit or Oil, for that it is the real Soul
thereof. Its powerful against a Leucophlegmatia, and the first beginnings of
Dropsies, where it is wonderful; for that it powerfully discharges the Spleen,
and other parts of the lower Belly, by Urine and transpiration; besides which,
it is good for all that simple Amber is good for, having all those virtues
mentioned in our Pharmacop. lib. 3. cap. 12. sect. 49. and acting with four
times the strength that simple prepared Amber can act withal. It is good
against all Distempers of the Head and Brain, comforts the Nerves and Womb,
opens Obstructions, and is prevalent against Scirrhus and other Tumors of the
Liver, Spleen, and Mesentery. Dose a gr.iiij. ad j. in Wine, Broth, or other
proper Vehicle. It is powerful in Vertigo's, Lethargies, Apoplexies,
Epilepsies, Convulsions, and Parsies, but chiefly for Diseases of the Womb. It
kills Worms, and is a preservative in Pestilential times. There are few
Medicines which equal this, for the Diseases it is designed for.

13. Sal sen Vitriolum Volatile Cupri; The Volatile Vitriol of Copper.

Green Verdigrise of Montpellier (made with the Recrements or pressings of
Grapes) lbvj. grind it into a subtle powder; put it into a glass Cucurbit, and
put upon it good distilled Vinegar, six inches high; stir it often with a
wooden spatula, the Cucurbit being placed in sand, and the Menstruum being
tinged, with a very deep green, decant it clean from the faeces, and put on
again fresh Vinegar distilled, which digest and stir as before, and when
sufficiently tinged, decant again. This Work Reiterate four times, till the
Menstruum will be but little tinged: at last boil the Faeces and last ^ffused
Spirit of Vinegar, that it may dissolve, and extract what is possible to be
gotten from the Verdigrise: thus continue with new spirit of Vinegar till the
whole Verdigrise is dissolved, except a few dirty faeces (having no Metalick
property in them) which will not be above j. in every pound. Put all these
Tinctures together, filterate them through paper; evaporate them in a very
gentle heat of B.M in an carthen or rather stone Pan, or in Balneo vaporoso,
till a pellicule or thin skin begins to appear, after which put in a cold place
for 24 hours, so will you find fair blew Cryctals or Vitriol stick to the sides
and bottom of the Vessel, which dry between two papers, in a very gentle heat;
for the heat of the Sun is enough to deprive this Vitriol (so Volatile it is)
of its best and subtilest Spirit. Take the remaining Liquor, evaporate again
gently, as aforesaid, after which set it again to Crystalize; which work repeat
till all the Salt is drawn forth. All being dry, you will find that you have as
much Vitriol, or rather more than you had of Verdigrise in weight, for that all
the saline, acid and tartarous substance of the Vinegar is joined to the
Vitriol, causing its Crystalization.

Now here is to be noted, 1. That if these Crystals be not very fair, blew and
transparent, you may dissolve them in fresh spirit of Vinegar, so much as may
just be fit to dissolve them cold; let the dissolution stand; that the
saeculent Atoms (if any be) may settle: the clear Tincture softly decant, but
when you come near to the bottom, let that be filterated through paper, by it
self; the Tincture by it self: which then mix together, and Crystalize, as
aforesaid. 2. That in all these filtrations from first to last, if any
considerable matter remains in the fitter, you are to dissolve it in fresh
spirit of Vinegar, and so cause it to go through, till all the metallic
substance is passed. 3. That after all is done, you are so often to dissolve
this blew Vitriol, to filterate, evaporate and crystalize, till the Vinegar (by
a distillation in B.M. or in Ashes at most) come forth as strong as it went in
(for in the first dissolution it will come forth as insipid in taste as water:)
so have you a noble Vitriol of great perfection, and highly volatile. 4. That
this volatile Vitriol is the very same that the mighty Spirit of Venus is to be
made of (as we have taught cap. 2. sect. 19. of this Book:) after that it has
been digested three several times with the best rectified S. V. three fingers
high above it, in a double or digesting Vessel, for the space of 24 hours, the
said S.V. being drawn off every time, whereby the body of the Vitriol might be
more and more opened, and prepared for the said Operation 5 That of this also
are you to make the sympathetical powder of Digby, mentioned in Our Pharm. lib.
3. cap. 11. sect. 77.

14. Sal Infernalis, The Caustic Salt.

Quicklime lbj. put it into a stone Pan; put upon it by spoonfulls, about four
ounces of cold water, that so it may gently and as much as may be without smoke
slacked, thereby to retain its volatile Salt, which would all sly away, were it
at first flak it, with a large quantity of water; moreover the volatile Salt is
more Caustic than the fixed. The Lame being well slaked, and thick as Past,
put upon it at once as much water as will make it like thin Pap; and then put
to it immediately good gravelled Ashes (or Tartar calcined to whiteness) lbij.
which let be red hot before hand, for an hour, in a reverberatory Furnace, in a
Crucible: this put in by spoonfulls, as hot as you you can: Then put upon all
this matter, water lbviij. to dissolve the Salts: let it stand 12 hours, so
have you a Lixivium, which separate by inclination from the Faeces into a
Copper Basin, which by reason of its Verdigrise, will accuate it the more, and
cause a bluish color. Put the Basin over a gentle fire, and evaporate the
Lixivium, till it be dry, and becomes a gray Salt, which will be in a lump; but
you may take it out by pieces, and keep it in a glass well stopped.

1. Here you are to note, that Clavellated or gravelled Ashes, are nothing else
but the Calx of Lees of Wine, and old pieces of Ca^ks made of Oak; and
therefore Tartar calcined may do the work as well. 2. That in this Operation no
Vessels of glaz^d Earth are to be used, because the Salts would be apt to
corrode the Lead, and thereby dull their own activity, which ought to be
preserved. 3. That if you would have your Salt well shaped; then when the
Lixivium is dried to a gray Salt,) ou must melt the said Salt, and then with an
Iron Spatula, red hot (for otherwise the Salts would presently congeal and
stick to it) take up as much as you please, and let it fall by drops upon a
cold Marble, which when cold take up with a Knise, and keep them in a glass
close stopped.. 4. That Lime has a twofold Salt, the one fixed, the other
Volatile; the first dissolves in the water which slacks the Lime, the other
vanishes in smoke: but if you slack it by little and little, putting on only
some spoonfulls at a time, there being but a little smoke, the volatile Salts
are but weakened, and so do dissolve in the water, and are here necessary,
because it is the Volatile Salt that makes the fixed Salt both of Lime and
Ashes to be susable, and also the more Caustic. 5. That this Cautery is
nothing else but a Salt, composed of the fixed and volatile Salts of the
Quicklime and Clavellated Ashes, elixiviated in common Water, coagulated by a
moderate heat, then melted and coagulated upon a cold Marble. 6. The name shows
the nature, that it is Caustic in a high degree, and produces its effect of
Cauterizing in a short time, and yet with much gentleness: it will always be
dry, if kept close stopped, but if it be too dry it cannot dissolve upon the
skin: therefore while you fit all things for its application, let it lie in a
spoonful of water.

15. Sal volatile, seu flores Benzoini, Flowers of Benjamin.

pure Benjamin q.v. make it into powder, put it into a Crucible, so as it may
be but half full: put the Crucible into a round Iron, that has sprigs or
branches on each side, which place upon a second row of Bricks, of a
Circulatory Furnace, so that your Crucible be suspended in the middle of the
Furnace, and the fire may strike immediately upon it, fit to the top of the
furnace a great earthen Cone (glazed or unglazed) as broad at bottom as the
Fuanace, but its top angular, where let be left a little hole to give the fire
air: lute this Cone to the Furnace, make a mean fire under the Crucible, so
will the Benjamin immediately rise, totally in dry fumes, and stick to the
sides of the Cone, white as snow, having the smell of Benjamin, but more subtle
and penetrating. At half an hours end, take off the Cone, and with a feather
gather all the flowers; which keep in a glass close stopped. In the bottom of the
Crucible will be nothing but black oily Faeces.

1. The whole substance of these Flowers are a Volatile and Balsamic Salt, and
therefore are given to ripen old Coughs, open the Lungs, and expectorate the
Phlegm: they have indeed all the virtues of Benjamin exalted. 2. The brim of the
Basis of the Cone is applied to the brim of the Furnace, not the brim of the
Crucible, least the heat there should be so strong as to make the sublimed Salt
or Flowers melt. 3. The Cone we use is of Earth (not of Paper, as most others
use) because it not only gathers a greater quantity of Flowers, but will
allways serve after. 4. These Flowers of Benjamin, are only the Gum melted in a
Crucible, then elevated in dry vapors to a snowy whiteness: This whiteness is
from the Volatile Salt, which predominates and invests the Flowers of that
color, which is the natural appearance of all volatile Salts. The red color of
the Gum consists in a little gross heavy Sulphur, which cannot be raised but by
the violence of Fire, in the distillation of its Oil.

16. Sal Putaminum O^strearum, Salt of Oystershells.

the oriental part of the upper part of the Oystershells, cleansed from all
their silth, with warm water or spirit of Vinegar, and dried in the Sun: lay
these shells upon 6 or 8 Tiles, made in the form of a half Circle, of such a
proportion, as that two of them joined together may fill the inward round of a
Reverberatory Furnace, leaving the space of an Inch empty between the sides of
the Furnace, and the said Tiles, to give the Fire play round about, and betwixt
the said Tiles: there must also be in two or three places of their
circumference an inlet or brim of an Inch deep, to let the flame in to calcine
the matter: place two of these Tiles upon the Iron Bars of the Furnace, and
upon them place 3 or 4 other lays of Tiles, one upon another, with Oyster
shells upon them, so that half a foot be left empty of the top of the Furnace,
which cover with an earthen Pan, turned upside down, or a Cupulo fitted to the
Furnace. Give a great fire at first with Wood and Coals, and when it is come to
the highest degree, continue it 12 hours, so will the flame, passing upon the
shells calcine them, and make them a calx as white as snow, and so brittle as
to fall into powder by touching them. This Calx is very salt, and yields its
Salt in good quantity, by dissolution in water, filtration and evaporation of
the Lixivium till it is dry.

1. Here is to be noted, that the shells ought to be cleansed from their
mucilaginousness, either by washing them in warm water, or by letting them soak
12 or 14 hours in Spirit of Vinegar, because otherwise that filth would spoil
the beauty of the Calx. 2. This Calx is composed of two substances, viz. of
white virginal Earth, and a good quantity of Salt, both fixed and Volatile, by
means whereof the said shells are naturally heavy. 3. We take the upper
Oyster-shell, because that is whiter, purer, thinner, and more easy to Calcine.
4. The Virtues of this Calx and its Salt are eminent against the Stone and
Gravel, being very opening and penetrating; the Calx is very drying by reason
of its Earth; The Dose of the Calx is a j. ad ss. but of the Salt a gr. x. ad
j. in some Conserve, Preserve, or Syrup. 5. After the same manner you may make
the Calx of Egg-shells: Or, Take a good quantity of clean Egg shells, bruised
topieces, fill an unglazed Earthen Pot with them, which set in a Potters
Furnace, for nine days, so will the Calx be white as Snow.

17. Sal Jovis, Salt of Tin.

Magistery of Tin, q. v. put upon it Spirit of Vinegar three Inches over it,
digest in a sand heat for three days; stirring it 5 or 6 times every day: then
decant the Liquor and add new spirit to the remainder; digest as before, and
decant; repeating the affusion of New Spirit, till the whole Magistery is
dissolved: silter all these impregnations, and evaporate the spirit in a glass
Cucurbit, over a sand heat, to the consumption of. then in a Cellar set it to
Crystalize, which separate from the Liquor: evaporate part of the liquor again,
and then set it to Crystalize as before; continuing this work till all the Salt
is drawn forth, which dry upon Paper in the Sun, and keep it in a glass close
stopped.

1. This salt is nothing more but the acids of the Vinegar, imbodied with the
particles of the Tin; for the Acids being taken away, the Tin will easily
revive again, as we have taught in Saccharum Saturni, Sect. 1. 13. above. 2.
That if you are not curious to have the Crystals, you may have a Salt as good
as the former, by a gentle evaporation of the Spirit. 3. That Tin calcined
howsoever, will never dissolve, unless it be first reduced or sublimed into
flowers. 4. That this Salt may be converted into a Magistery again, by
dissolving it in Spirit of Vinegar, and then precipitating it with Oil of
Tartar, per deliquium. 5. That this Salt is drying and good against Scabs,
Tettars, and Ringworms, having much the Virtues of the salt of Saturn: some
also say, it is a most powerful thing against fits of Mother. Dose a gr. iij.
ad vi. in Wine.

18. Sal Tarta^i Emeticum ex vitro Antimonij; Ememetick Tartar from Glass of
Antimony.

Crystals of Tartar in powder vj. put upon it in a glass vessel so much spirit
of Urine, as to cover it two or three inches thick; the Cream of Tartar being
dissolved, put thereto Vitrum Antimonij levigated jss. fair water xv. boil all
in a sand Furnace 8 hours, putting more hot water into the vessel as it
consumes, then filtrate, and evaporate gently in Sand all the humidity, so will
a greyish white powder remain, which keep in a Vial close stopped. Or thus, from
LeFebure. Levigated powder of glass of Antimony, Crystal of Tartar, A. iiij.
put them into a glass Cucurbit in sand, to which put iiij. of distilled Rain
Water, boil and evaporate to dryness: dissolve the matter again in a sufficient
quantity of the same water, filterate the dissolution to separate the
Antimonial powder, then evaporate the filtrated liquor to a Salt, on which put
guttatim good Spirit of Vitriol, till there is no more ebulition or noise, then
evaporate all the superfluous humidity, so have you a pure Salt of a pleasant
taste.

1. It is good in Lethargues, Apopleties, Epilepsies, Ravings, and all other
Diseases of the Brain. It cures Diseases of the Stomach, Vomiting, Jaundice,
Dropsies, Quotidian, Tertian and Quartan Agues, expels poison, and the like. 2.
The former of them may be given from four grains to fifteen in Broth: the
latter from gr. x. ad ss. being a Remedy which cannot be sufficiently praised,
you may give it in Broth, or other convenient Vehicle, it works chiefly by
Stool and Urine, but sometimes provokes Vomiting, when it meets with a stomach
stufft with slime and viscosity. 3. In the former some part of the glass of
Antimony dissolves in the boiling, and gives the Emetick quality to the powder,
which is very gentle, because the Tartar has sixth a little the Sulphur of the
Antimony.

19. Sal Tartari Foliatum, Foliated Salt of Tartar.

Salt of Tartar q. v. put it into a large glass Cucurbit, and gently pour upon
it as much spirit of Vinegar as the Salt can suck up, so that they may be
saciated by each other, and no effervescency at all; by this the Work is done
at once, and the salt of Tartar and acid of the Vinegar are perfectly united:
some part of the humidity of the spirit evaporate by a gentle sandheat, so will
you have a black substance at the bottom of the Glass. It being cold, dissolve
it in good S.V. filter it through brown paper, and in a glass Cucurbit in a
sand heat; evaporate the spirit till the remaining substance is dry; this
dissolve in S. V. again, filterate and evaporate as before: this Work repeat
till the salt is white, dry, and in distinct leaves at the bottom of the
Vessel, which is the reason it is called foliated, or salt of Tartar in leaves.

1. There are various ways of making this foliated Salt of Tartar, but this is
accounted the best, the design being to faciate the sixth salt of Tartar with
the acidity of the Vinegar, and by means of the S. V. to unite them the more
closely together. 2. This preparation differs little in nature and qualities
from that of the sal Tartari Vitriolatum (wherein the Salt is satiated with a
more powerful acid) but only in the addition of the S.V. which is a most
Volatile Sulphur, and as the acids exceeding or over pouring that spirit, is
the cause of turning Wine into Vinegar; so the said Sulphur or S.V. qualifies
(in this preparation) the extreme tartness of the acid of the Vinegar, by which
the quality of the salt is changed, and a peculiar virtue is made manifest. 3.
This Salt seems to be of a mentral nature, between sixed and volatile, or
neither of them: it is good to cleanse and purify the whole mass of blood, and
to take away gently all Tartarous Humors, the causes of many Chronick and
rebellious Diseases: it keeps the belly soluble, and purges by urine all the
filth of the Reins, Ureters and Bladder. Dose a gr. v. ad. x. in Broth, or
other proper Vehicle. 4. This salt has power to penetrate and open several
minerals, and to extract Tinctures, especially from Mars, by adding to it
spirit of Wine, or some other Liquor, if you dissolve it in any Cordial water,
you may Crystalize it according to the ordinary way. The leaves also being set
in a damp Cellar will dissolve in a kind of purple colored Liquor, of the same
nature with the Salt, the which you may give a gut. vj. ad xij. or xjv, as
aforesaid.

20. Sal Tartari Volatile, Volatile Salt of Tartar.

Salt of Tartar, pure and very dry lbiij. or lbiiij. crude Roch Alum, or the
Caput Mortuum of Roch Alum in powder as much, put them into a large earthen
Retort, well coated about; place it in a close furnace of Reverberation, and
distill with a gradual fire, gently at first, but increased at last to the
highest degree of heat, so shall you have (when the Vessels are cold) in the
Receiver a large quantity of Volatile salt of Tartar, whose scent and taste will
be very subtle and penetrating, with the spirituous water of the Alum mixed
with it, which you may separate by rectifying it the ordinary way, so will you
have the volatile Salt of Tartar in its purity and perfection. Or thus, Take
Tartar calcined to blackness or somewhat more lbiij, put it into a great iron
pot, upon which put fair water so much as to overtop it an inch or more; put
the pot over a very gentle fire, which when the calcined Tartar is thoroughly
inbodied, and become lukewarm, strew by degrees upon it, crude Tartar finely
poudred M.j. so will an effervescence arise: continue to strew new powder of
Tartar upon it by degrees, so will the sermentation increase, and the bubbles
grow greater and multiply, gathering themselves together, not much unlike
clusters of grapes: in the Interim let not the fire exceed in heat, such as are
commonly used for Fermentations, still strewing-in the Powder very finely, and
not too much at a time, lest the Ebulition come over the sides of the Vessel:
when you see the ebulition ceases, you must cease to strew in any more crude
powder of Tartar. Then put this Liquor into a Gourd of iron very large and
high, which cover with its head and a recipient, and lute well the junctures,
and distill in a sand heat with a very gentle sire, chiefly at first, applying
continually cold wet Cloths about the Gourd, to stop a little the b^yling of
the matter, at last augment the fire, so will the volatile Salt ascend. The
distilled liquor rectify again, as much as is fit for separation of the Salt,
which you will have in whiteness and purity. Or thus; of the black distilled
Oil of Tartar lbj. fine Salt of Tartar lbij. mix them well together, and put
them into a glass Retort, which stop extremely close, and place it for six
months over a Bakers Oven, or otherlike heat in sand, moderately hot: then open
the mouth of the Retort and affix thereto a large Receiver well luted: put it
into a sand heat with a gradual fire, so will a great quantity of a Volatile
Salt be drawn forth smelling like Urine, White, Crystalline, and of a very
penetrating scent, accompanied with a small quantity of the same Salt, which is
found dissolved into liquor, mixed with a little Oil, almost as subtle and
penetrating as the oil it self. Or thus, Lees of Wine dried in a gentle fire,
put them into a large earthen or glass Retort, so as to fill it about two third
parts full: put it into a Reverberatory Furnace, with a large Recipient, make a
small fire first to heat the Cornute by degrees that the insipid phlegm may be
drawn forth: when fumes or Vapors begin to arise, empty the phlegm out of the
Receiver, and put it to the beak of the Cornute again, luting it well: increase
the fire by degrees, till the Recipient is filled with white Clouds: continue
the fire at that height, till the Recipient begin to cool: then increase the
fire to the highest, which continue so long, till no more Vap^rs ascend. The
Vessels being grown cold, unlute the Recipient, and shake it well about, to
cause the Volatile Salt which sticks to it, to fall to the bottom: then put all
into a bolt head with a long neck, fitted with its head and a small Receiver,
well lute the joints, put it into a sand-heat with a little fire, so will the
volatile Salt arise and stick to the head and top of the Bolthead: take off
this Head, and apply another in its stead, gather your Salt, and close it up
immediately, for it easily dissolves into Liquor: continue still the fire, and
continually gather up the Salt, as you see it ascend. When no more will arise,
you may distill a small quantity of a Liquor, and then put out the Fire, this
Liquor is a volatile Salt joined with some Phlegm, and may be called volatile
spirit of Tartar, having the same virtues with the salt, and may be given from
eight drops to twenty four. Or thus, Wine Lees q. v. separate by straining and
expression the Wine joined with them: of the Wine draw a most subtle, volatile
and Inflamable spirit, which reserve. The Magma remaining, dry in the Sun or in
a gentle sand heat: powder it, and sprinkle it with the after-reserv'd spirit,
or other well rectified S.V. being moderately moistened, let the whole Mass dry
of it self, where you dried it before: then fill with it two thirds of a large
Retort of Potters Earth, place it in a large furnace of Reverberatition, fitted
and well luted to a large Recipient, then distill first with a gentle fire,
increasing it by degrees for about 12 hours, till the fire comes to the ut most
violence. After which, the Vessels being cold, unlute them, and you will have
in the Receiver, the Volatile Salt of Tartar mixed with the oily part, and much
phlegm. Empty both together into a large Mattress with a long neck, which place
in a sand heat, which cover with its head well luted to a Receiver; destill
with a moderate fire, as in the Rectification of other Volatile Salts, so will
you perceive the Volatile Salt of Tartar, ascending first, to stick to the
inside of the head in a white and Crystalline form, which gather with what
dexterity you can, that it may be purely separated fro the oily part, which
will ascend nex to this volatile salt, with the phlegm also, impregnated with
some small portion of this said Salt. The rectified S.V. is not absolutely
necessary in this work; but there is this in it, that by embracing some part of
the acid of the Lees, and taking it along with it in its dissipation, if frees
the Volatile Salt, whereby you will have it in greater quantity than otherwise
it could be got.

1. Here is to be noted, That in the first way of making this Volatile Salt,
with Alum or its Caput Mortuum, that the Acid contained in the Alum is so
weak and inconsiderable, that the reason of the said Salt's Volatization cannot
be attributed thereto, but rather to its fixed part, which remains after
distillation, which effect it produces without any participation with the Acid:
but suppose it should participate of some small portion of the Alum: (which we
can yet prove it dos not) that mineral Salt yields nothing of evil in
Distillation, and its spirituous water is beneficially used in Diseases of the
mouth and throat. 2. In the second way, the Volatization is made by a natural
fermenration, caused by mixing the fixed Salt of Tartar with raw Tartar,
because it is thought that this fermentation, makes so perfect a division of the
parts, of both the calcined and crude matters, that after distillation, there
is not to be found at all any Salt either fixed or volatile. 3. In the Third
way, where the Distilled oil of Tartar is used, this is apparent, that although
the said oil contains much of the Volatile Salt, as do several other Oils; yet
our Volatile Salt of Tartar proceeds not from it; but that the greatest part of
it proceeds from the Salt of Tartar it self: The Reason is, because the
Volatile Salt ascends in very great quantity, viz. much more than you put in
Oil; and also because there remains only an oily Coal (as faeces) weighing very
much less than the Salt of Tartar made use of. The reason of this may be from
the long digestion, by which the smallest particles of both substances are
opened and divided, thereby disordering them, and giving them a new Situation,
whereby fixed Salt, quitting its Chains, immediately becomes Volatile, and
manifests it self with all its qualities. This arises from the secret
sermentation of the Volatile Salt in the Oil of Tartar, with the Acid of the
fixed Salt, converting it in some measure into its own proper substance, whereby
there is a change of figure and Situation in the parts, as aforesaid: and
thereby a volatization of the Salts, both alcalious and acid. 4. The Fourth and
fifth ways dislerent much one from the other, save in the Addition of the
Spirit of Wine: Here the acid substance of the juice of the Grape unites it
self with a great part of the Volatile Salt, to make the Composition of the
Tartar, whence it is that Tartar yields not so much Volatile Salt as the Lees at
the bottom of the cask, which mightily abounds in a volatile Salt, and a
sulphurous Spirit: Hence it is that the Volatile Salt of Tartar is more easily
and plentifully drawn from the Lees, than from the more solid and stony Tartar.
5. This volatile Salt, is said to purify the whole Mass of Blood both by sweat
and urine, and sometimes by stool, whereby a Mass of putrefactive humors and
matter are carried off: It is good against the Palsy, Apoplexy, Epilepsie, and
all intermitting Fevers, chiefly the Tertian and Quartan. It opens all sorts
of Obstructions of Liver, Spleen and Gall: cures Cachexies, Dropsies, Jaundice,
Scurvy and other stubborn Diseases. Dose a gr. x. ad j. in a sit Liquor or
Conserve.

CHAP. XI. Of LIQUORS.
1. LIquor Argenteus seu Catharticum Argenteum, The silver Purge.

of the best native Cinnabar reduced into fine Powder v. fine silver in leaves
j. ss. the best copper in small filings jss: dissolve each apart in double AF,
or the best Sp. of Nitre make a Precipitation of the Calces, which you shall
free from the Corrosive Spirits of the AF or Spirit of Niter according to Art.
These Calces dissolve again apart in Spirit of Honey o^ Spirit of Salt;
precipitate again, and sweeten, as aforesaid; from which being mixed together,
you shall three times burn off a sit quantity of Rect fied S.V. The Calces thus
sweetened and dried, you shall put into a Glass Mattress, upon which you shall
affuse our universal Menstruum, xiiij. (which is the Menstruum of the World,
and a true dissolvent) set them in a Philosophic heat, or the fire of Nature
for 24 hours, so will it radically dissolve the Calces, and bring them into
their first matter: this dissolution decant, filter and keep for Use: upon the
remaining Calx undissolved (if any be) affuse more of the Menstruum, which
digest, decant, and filter, as aforesaid: thus continuing the affusion of new
Menstruum, so long till the whole Calx is dissolved, you will have, at last, an
almost colour-less, smell-less tast-less Liquor, especially if it be mixed with
any other Vehicle.

1. Here is to be noted That this Menstruum adds nothing of Vitue to the
Medicine simply from it self, but only by Accident, as more perfectly
dissolving and opening the bodies of those several Calces, whereby their
Potestates or Powers more easily mingle themselves with the Sanguinous Mass,
and thereby fix their Caracter upon the whole habit of the Body. 2. That this
Silver purge is an admirable thing beyond most other Medicaments, and performs
whatever any other Purge or Vomit can do. If the Stomach be foul, it will
cleanse it, and work gently both by Vomit and Stool; if the Stomach be not
foul, it only works downwards: if it be given in a small Dose, it works neither
upwards nor downwards, and yet by a constant taking it for some time, as 2, 3
or 4 months, it cures almost incurable Diseases, without any manifest
alteration. 3. That it is called the Silver Purge, not that THAT is the
ingredient whose quantity is largest, but because it is the ingredient from
whence is drawn the Cathartick force of the Medicament, for that without it,
the Medicament would not Purge at all. 4. That by means of the Menstruum, the
purging of the Medicine is not only certain, but determined to a certain time;
for, whereas without this Dissolution, the particles of the Calx might closely
adhere to the Tunicles of the Ventricles, causing, a continual working,
sometimes for 2, 3 or 4 days together; now no such thing can be by reason of
this liquid form, whereby it is seldom known to work above 2, 3 or 4 hours at
most. 5. That it opens all Obstructions of the Bowels, as Lungs, Liver, Spleen,
Reins, Womb, Mesentery, and Lacteal Veins: but here is to be noted, That it
ought to be given in Obstructions of the Lungs for 12 or 16 days, in such a
proportion as it may neither Vomit nor purge, and that in all the Liquor the
Sick drinks 5 or 6 times a day: in the other Cases you may give it in the
largest proportion that is fit for the Age and Strength of the person. It cures
Agues and Fevers of all sorts at 2, 3 or 4 times taking, and I have sometimes
cured an Ague with it at once taking. It cures almost all Diseases of the Head,
as Head-achs, Megrims, Frenzy, Madness, Fallingsickness, Apoplexics,
Convulsions, Palsies, Lethargies, Vertigo's, and other like Distempers of the
Brain. It is a Specific Remedy for the Cure of most Chronick Distempers, as
Quartan Agues, Hypochondriack Melancholy, pains of the Stomach, swellings of
the Liver and Spleen, Cachexies, Green Sickness, Stoppage of the Terms, etc. It
carries off the impurities of the Stomach, cleanses the Blood, restores it to
its course and circulation, cherishes the Vital Spirits, restores the functions
of all the Parts, adding to the Body Strength and Vigor. It perfectly cures the
Gout, given in the Paroxism so as it may not work; but after the Fit is over,
so that it may work strongly. It cures the Scurvy, Dropsy and and Kings. Evil,
as it were to a Miracle; so also the Jaundice, Sciatica, Worms, Rickets in
Children, Consumptions occasioned through manifold Obstruction, Fits of the
Mother, and most other stubborn Diseases, not to be cured by any other
Medicine. It is also eminently good in the Cure of all running sores, old
Ulcers, Fistula's, Pox, etc. in any part of the body, proceeding from what
cause soever. 6. That the way of exhibiting it, is either as a Diet, whereby
the Body is only altered, or with an Intention to purge. If as a Diet, give 2,
3, 4, 6, 8 or 10 drops at a time, 4, 5 or 6 times a day in Beer, Ale or Wine,
according as the Sick is in Age and Strength, If with an intention to purge,
give to Infants (quoad capax) from 5 to 20 drops. To Children of 4, 6, 8 10 or
12 years of Age, from 20 to 40 or 50 drops. To Youth from 10 to 16 years, from
50 to 80 drops: From 16 or 18 to 40, 50 or 60 years of Age, from 120 drops, to
160 or 200 drops, which is from about iij. ad iss. or ij; always observing
this, to increase the Dose every time till it works enough. Give it in Broth,
Beer, Ale or Wine, and that every 4, 5, or 6th day in the morning fasting;
having some Broth, Mace Ale or Posset Drink to take after it; being mixed with
its Vehicle, no Stomach can refuse it. One Oance will make 4, 6, 8, or 10
several Doses, according to the Age and Strength of the Patient. 7. Now this is
specially to be noted, That in all Chronick Diseases it ought to be used (as
well as for purging) a Dietetick way; constantly giving it in a few Drops, as
aforesaid 5 or 6 times aday, by which means it insensibly alters the whole
habet of the body, and may indeed serve instead of many other Diets in those
very Cases. For this is very certain, unless the whole habit be absolutely
altered, no cure can be expected: for the cure in such Diseases always follows
the alteration of the Habit; as every man experienced in Physic does
sufficiently know. 8. Lastly, That in External Diseases, you may bath the part
or parts afflicted therewith, for that it has both a digestive and resolutive
Power: giving it also inwardly in a proper Vehicle (as aforesaid) either as
Diet or purge, or both, as you see occasion requires: this being observed, the
Alteration and Cure of the Disease will the more spedily succeed, to the
satisfaction of thesick: But this you must note, That it be with Caution used
to raw places, least it cause much smarting: in this case let it be first
diluted with a little Rose- or Plantane-Water, Price 5 s. an ounce.

2. Liquor Aureus, Liquor (called by some Oil) of Gold.

Sol p.j. Spanish or rather Hungarian Mercury, p. vj. mix both together, and
then distill the Mercury from the Sol: after mix the same Mercury again with the
Gold, which Amalgamation continue till the Sol will not mix with your Mercury.
Then take the Sol, grind it, and put it into a clean crucible, and calcine it,
till it be almost red hot, after which extinguish your Sol, in the best
rectified Spirit of Vinegar, pour the Vinegar from the Sol, and dry the Sol
well, then make it hot again, extinguish it in your former Vinegar, which do 5
or 6 times: This done, take your Sol, dry it, and Amalgama it again with the
Mercury, and distill it agin as at first: this do so long, till your Sol will
not mix with your Mercury; then calcine your Sol again, and extinguish it in
the former Vinegar 5 or 6 times: if your Vinegar wastes, you may add to it some
fresh spirit: thus continue till you think there is no strength left in your
Mercury: Afterward you must take fresh Mercury, and go to work, as before, and
so continue till you have enough from the Gold. Then take the Vinegar which is
impregnated with the whole Essence of Sol, evaporate it, or distill it very
softly off, and it will lie at the bottom like a yellow Salt, which you shall
dissolve in distilled Rainwater: filter it, and evaporate it again softly, put
it into a little Retort, and place it in sand, with an indifferent large
Receiver; give fire by degrees, and it will come over in a white spirit-like
smoke, and then it will ascend and come over like red Saffron, which will
resolve into a red liquor, then let the fire go out; and keep the distilled
matter for use.

This is one of the greatest Arcanums under the Sun, scarcely inferior to any
other: iij or jv drops are able to extinguish any sickness or disease: in this
Oil of Gold is one of the greatest Secrets of Nature. It is said to tinge Luna
into perfect Sol: and with this Liquor Raimund Lully figureth Mercury in
Exenterata Natura.

3. Liquor Aureus, seu Aurum potabile, Francisci Antonij. The Golden Liquor or
Potable Gold of Dr. Anthony.

Block Tin, calcine it in an iron Pan (made red hot before you put the Tin in)
keep a continual fire under it, stirring it always till it be like unto Ashes;
of which some part will look red; the Calcination will be half a day at least,
all which time it must be stirred with a little iron Cole-rake, with a handle
about 2 feet long. These Ashes keep in a Glass close covered: of these Ashes
take jv. spirit of the strongest red Wine Vinegar lbiij: put them into an
Vrinab like glass, the Ashes being put in first: lute the Vessels, and digest
in a hot Balneum ten days, after which take it forth and set it to cool, and
lot it stand 2 or 3 whole days, that the faeces may sink to the bottom, shaking
the glass 6 or 7 times every day. That which is clear, decant, or filter it by
2 or 3 threads into a glassbason; and destil it in a glass Still, till the
Liquor be all drawn off. This distilled water put upon fresh Ashes jv. Upon the
Ashes from which the first Liquor was distilled, put also spirit of strong red
Wine-Vinegar, lute the glasses as before, and put them into the Balneum, and
digest it 10 days, filter and distill as aforesand: Pour on the Ashes again
fresh spirit lb j: digest in Balreo 10 days: filter again, and distill, as
aforesaid: after the third Infusion cast away the Ashes: distill all the
Infusions apart, till the Liquor be wholly drawn forth. Take this distilled
Liquor, as often as it is distilled, and pour it upon new Ashes, (keeping the
Weight and Order) these Infusions, filtrations and distillations reiterate 7
times: and you shall have of this water the Menstruum sought for. This spirit
must be from the strongest Vinegar, and from red Wine, otherwise the Menstruum
will not perform its work. Take of the most pure refined Gold j: file it into
fine dust with a fine file, calcine it, and put to it so much white Salt, as
will near fill the Pot it is calcined in, set it among Charcoal, where it may
stand continually hot for jv hours (if it stand too hot the Sal will melt) then
put it on a Painters Stone, and grind it very small with a Muller: put it into
the Pot and calcine it, and grind it again, till you have done it 4 or 5 times:
if it lookred and blew when you take it forth, it is perfect and good. After
this calcining and grinding, put it into a glass-Bason, which fill with
Scalding hot water; stir it a good while, let the thick part settle to the
bottom, then aecant the water: put more water, stir it, and let it settle, and
decant it, as before: thus do so long till the water, after settling has no
taste of Salt, which will be 2 or 3 days in doing. Of this ounce of Gold,
there will scarcely be above gr, xvj or xvij. brought into fine white Calx: but
to separate it from the Gold, leave a little of the last fresh water in the
Basin, and stir it well together, the Calx will swim at the top, which softly
pour off from the Gold, into another Basin: if all the white Calx go not forth,
put to a little more water, and stir it again, and pour it off in to the Basin
to the other Calx: then let it settle, and decant almost all the water; what
remains evaporate away, over a gentle heat, till it is thoroughly dry, which
keep in a glass close stopped: The Gold which is not yet in Calx, put to the
Salt, as aforesaid, which calcine and grind four times again; and then wash it,
and separate the Calx from it, as before: what Gold remains again calcine and
wash again, repeating this work till the whole ounce is brought into a white
Calx. Take of this Calx j; which put it into an Vrinal-like glass containing
about a pint, put to it half a pint of the Menstruum: set the Glass in a hot
B.M. for six days (being close luted) shake it often every day; when the six
days are ended, let it stand 2 or 3 days, then decant that which is clear,
very gently, for fear of troubling the Faeces. To the faeces, put fresh
Menstruum, but not fully so much as at first, and so the third time, but not
fully so much as at the second, then take the dry faeces which is the Calx and
keep it, lest some Tincture remain in it. These colored Liquors put into a
glass Still, and distill in B.M. with a very gentle fire, till all that which is
clear is come over, and that which remains be as thick as honey: then take it
forth and let it cool: put the glass into an earthen pot, and put ashes about
the glass into the Pot, and fix the pot fast into a little Furnace, and make a
fire under, so that the glass may stand very warm, till the Faeces be black and
very dry: (you may look with a Candle through the glass, and see when it is
risen with Bunches and dry:) then take away the fire, let the glass be very
cold, and take out the black earth: this black earth put into a glass basin,
grind it with the bottom of another round Glass to pounder, put it into an
Vrinallike glass containing about a pint: to which affuse above half a pint of
the spirit of Wine: set this Glass in a cold place, till it be red, which will
be in about ten days time; shake it often every day, till within three days
you pour it forth: Then gently decant the clear Liquor, which put into a glass
alembeck (or other Glass, till you have more of it:) to the faeces put more S.
V. which digest, shake and decant, as before: if that be much colored, put S.
V. to it the third time, as at first: put all these colored liquors together,
and distill till the feces (called the Tincture) is as thick as a Syrrup or new
Honey: take one ounce of this Tincture, and put it into a pint of choice Canary
wine: and when it is clear, whichwill be in about a day and half, or two days
time, it will be fit for use.

1. This is the true preparation of that famous Medicine, the Aurum potabile of
that most Famous and learned English man Doctor Francis Anthony; taken from his
own hand writing, which he sent in a Letter to Bishop Bilson; the Bishop made
it according to this Recipe: and Mr. John Goodyer a Physician (sometime the
Bishops servant) coppied it from the Doctor's Original aforesaid, sent to the
Bishop: this Goodyer dying left it to Mr. Edmund Yalden a Minister of the
Church of England at Compton night Godliman in Surry, who communicated it to
me, with the Original letter to the Bishop under Dr Anthoney's hand, which I
have now by me. 2. There are many pretended Preparations of this Medicine
extant, as that in Schroder (mentioned in our Pharmacopoeia) and those
published by Horstius; which Dr. John French has published in his Art of
Distillation, lib. 6. page 198. But we being satisfied That this true Copy was
taken from an Original under Dr. Anthonies own hand, could do no less, but
faithfully communicate it to the World, as we received it. 3. How the Spirit of
Vinegar to form the Menstruum is made, We shall here show you from the same
Authograph. Get 3 or 4 Glassstills, which will hold a Gallon or two apiece, and
about 6 Gallons of the strongest red Wine Vinegar (Vinegar of Claret or
Whitewine are too weak) made of red Wine, Sack, or Muscadine: put the Vinegar
into the Stills, and set as many a going as the Balneum will hold (which
Balneum ought to be twofoot and a half square, to hold many Glasses:) Take a
pint of that which runs first, and put it away as weak, and not fit for this
use: thus, Distill the rest to dryness: Wash the Still with a little of the
phlegm or first running: Destill again, and put away the first pint; thus do
four times, so of a Gallon you will have three pints of the Spirit of Vinegar;
and of your six Gallons only two Gallons, and two pints: if your spirit be yet
too weak, you must distill it oftener: keep it close stopped in a Glass to make
your Menstruum with, you may stop it with Cork and Leacher: for a Quart of this
Menstruum Bishop Bilson gave Dr. Anthony 30 shill. 4 To make the Menstruum
with, you may provide 3 strong great Glasses containing 2 quarts a piece, with
little mats round the bottom: In luting, first stop the mouth of the Glass with
a Wooden stopple of dry wood, first boiled, then dried in an Oven, and dipped in
wax: then melt hard Wax over all, and paste brown Paper next over that, over
which apply lute made of Clay, horse-dung and ashes. Let also the Closings of
the head of the Still, as also the joining of the Beak of the Alembeck and
Receiver be pasted together, and made firm with brown paper, so that no
strength may go forth. 5. The Virtues hereof are the same with other Aurum
Potabile's, and it has almost done Miracles, as the Author thereof relates: It
fortifies the Heart, revives the Spirits, strengthens Nature and restores it:
and is a most admirablething in fainting and swooning fits, palpitation and
other defects of the Vital spirits: it is good against poison, bitings and
stingings of venomous beasts, the Plague or Pestilence, and all other malign
and contagious Diseases. We have here given you the true, that from Horstius
follows.

4. Liquor Aureus Francisci Antonii, ex Horstio, the Aurum Potabile of Dr.
Anthony, as it is in Horstius.

Of the finest Gold, dissolve it in AR. according to Art ( the AR. being made
of AR. lbj. and Sal Armoniack jv. distiled together by a Retort in Sand:) this
clear Solution put into a large Glass having a a wide neck; and upon it put
drop by drop Oleum Tartari per deliquium, until the AR. which before was
yellow, becomes clear and white; for that is a sign that all the Solar Calx is
fallen to the bottom: let it stand all night, and in the morning pour off the
clear liquor: wash the Calx 4 or 5 times with Common spring water being warmed;
then dry it with a very gentle heat, for if the heat be too great, the Calx
will take fire presently like Gun-pouder, and fly away, which may be as well
dangerous, as a great loss; for which cause it will be best to dry it in she
Sun upon a stone, stirring it well with a wooden spatula: to this Calx add half
as much powder of Sulphur, mix them together, and in an open Crucible let the
Sulphur consume in the fire, putting a gentle fire to it at first, and toward
the end a most strong fire for the space of an hour, that the Calx may be a
little reverberated, and become most subtle, which keep in a Vial close stopped
for Use. This done, Take Urine of a sound, he althy man who mode rately drinks
wine, put it in, to a Cucurbit, which stop close and set in Horse-dung for 40
days; after distill it by an Alembeck in sand with a large Recipient, until
all the humidity is drawn off; rectify this spirit by Cohobation three times,
that you may obtain the spirit only, then distill it in sand by a bolt head
with a long neck, having a large Receiver affixed to it, and the joints well
luted, so will the spirit ascend into the top of the Vessel like Crystal,
without any aquosity at all, which distillation you must continue till all the
spirit is ascended. These Crystals dissolve in distilled Rainwater, and
distill as befone, which work repeat six times, every time taking fresh
distilled rainwater. Then put these Crystals into a Glass bolthead, which
close hermetically; put it into Balneo with a moderate heat, for 15 days, that
they may be reduced into a most clear Liquor, to which add S.V. rectified, an
equal quantity: digest again in Balneo the space of 12 days, in what time they
will be united. Take the Calx of Gold abovesaid, put upon it these united
spirits, so much as will cover it 3 Inches, digest in a gentle heat, till the
liquor is tinged red as blood. 'Decant the Tincture, and put on more of the
aforesaid spirits, doing as before, till all the Tincture is extracted: Put all
these tinged spirits together, digest them 10 or 12 days, then abstract the
spirit with a gentle heat, and cohobate once: then the Calx will remain in the
bottom like an oil, as red as blood, and of a pleasant odor, dissoluble in any
Liquor. If you distill the same by a Retort in sand, there will come over (after
the first part of the Menstruum) the Tincture, with the other part thereof as
red as blood, the Earth which is left in the bottom of the Vessel being dry,
black, spongy and light. The Menstruum being evaporated away, the Oil of Gold
will remain by it self, which keep as the most excellent Arcanum.

The Virtues are the same with the former, being given a gr. jv ad viij, it
wonderfully refreshes the Spirits, and works several ways chiefly by Sweat.

It was invented as a constant Liquor, to be drunk of those that are frequently
troubled with Catarrhs; for it excellently strengthens the Stomach, head and
Brain, and cures all manner of Distillations caused from Distempers of those
parts. Drink it in the Morning fasting, just before Dinner, and last at night
going to bed. It also powerfully expels Wind, and gives ease in the Cholick.

It is an excellent thing in all hot Catarrhs, where the humor is thin, sharp
and salt: in a vehement and continual Cough, it is a secret. It thickens the
Rheum, Glutinates and causes expectoration, it quenches Thirst, mitigates the

powerful; however it is very profitable, in all thin and sharp Rheums, and
other Diseases of the Lungs and Aspera Arteria: it takes away the vehemence of
Coughing, and causes rest, for which things it is highly celebrated by
Montanus. We have here substituted Myrtle-berries instead of Althaea roots,
advised by Montanus; the reason is, because the Althaea roots render the
Medicine of an ungrateful or unpleasant scent, and we judge the Myrtleberries
to be full as efficacious.

CHAP. XIX. Of PRESERVES.
1. COnserva Prophylactica Barbetti, The Preservative Conserve of Barbet.

the inward Pulp, and beaten very small, conserves of white Roses, of red Roses,
of Borrage flowers, A. lb ss. Preserved Orange Peels iiij. mix, and beat them
into a Mass.

may be taken in Pestilential times morning, noon and night, ad ss or more,
drinking a glass of choice Canary after.

2. Conserva Rosarum Pallidarum, Conserve of Damask Roses.

Damask Roses, what you please, sprinkle them with spirit of Sulphur in a stone
Pan, put it over the heat of a Bath, or other convenient heat, and turn them
continually till they become like a thick pap, which will be in about a quarter
of an hour: take these flowers out thus prepared, and put in more, continuing
so till you have prepared all your leaves and flowers, then put them all
together, and put to them double their weight of fine sugar, finely poudred and
beat them all together, so will your conserve be both pleasant and durable.

1. It is a good thing to cool the heat of Blood, and is very beneficial in all
violent Fevers whatsoever. 2. The Spirit of Sulphur has a twofold respect,
first it revives and quickens the natural color of the Herb or Flower,
preserves it and recovers it, if decaying: Secondly, it is as a Salt to those
leaves or flowers, to preserve them from corruption. 3. By this method you may
make a Conserve in Winter of dried Roses, whose color you may revive and make
an excellent red, but your work will he a little the more tedious, viz. about
an hour, but the Conserve will last and keep the longer. 4. That if this
Conserve of Roses had been sprinkled with Oil of Tartar per del. and stirred,
it would have been as green as Grass. 5. That after the former manner you may
make Conserve of other Flowers and Herbs.

Brain, causes sleep, and abates the heat of Fevers.

8. Conserva Anthos, Conserve of Rosemary flowers.

It is made as is that of Violets, save it is completed with treble the weight
of the flowers in Sugar.

This has been of long and great use among Physicians, because of its mighty
power in strengthening the Nerves, Brain, and whole Head, causing liveliness,
cheerfulness and watchfulness: it is therefore happily given in Lethargies,
Dullness, Drowsiness, Epilepsies, Apoplexies, Tremblings, Palsys, faintings,
swoonings, and other Distempers of the Head, Brain and Heart.

9. Conserva florum Betonicae, Conserve of Betony flowers.

convenient Water for 12. hours; then strain, and to the straining add Juice of

14. To preserve or pickle Cucumbers the usual way as Oyl-men do them.

A thousand Cucumbers long English seed (not French) wash them very clean, and
let them drein in a Sive; put them into a pot or Vessel stratum super stratum,
or in lays, first, a lay of Dill and Fennel, then a Lay of Cucumbers, then a
lay of Dill and Fennel, and then again a lay of Cucumbers, thus continuing till
the Pot or Jar is full: to this put a Pickle made with five Galons of Beer or
Rape Vinegar, in which so much Salt is dissolved by boiling, as that it may
bear an Egg, in which dissolve also Roch Alum iij: adding in gross powder
Ginger ij: White peper, Coriander seed, Dill seed, of each j: Cloves ij: put
this pickle among the Cucumbers in the Vessel aforesaid, which cork up closely,
covering it with Wax or Rosin: About a Month or 6 weeks after take the Pickle
out, boil it on brisk fire and Scum it, and put it in again to the Cucumbers
hot, which cover close as before, so will your Cucumbers keep long and be
green: If they be not green enough boil the Pickle again, and pu^ it to the
Cucumbers as before.

Here is to be noted, 1. That the best Wine Vinegar is much the better than
Beer Vinegar, as Experience has testified.

2. That it would be convenient for the Emptying of the Jar, to have a hole
near the bottom of it, That a Brass cock might be there placed.

15. To preserve or Pickle Cucumbers another way.

A Thousand Cucumbers, wash and lay them with Dill and Fennel in a Pot or Jar,
as aforesaid, to which put this following Pickle. of the best White wine
Vinegar, gal.iv. Brine (made so strong with water and Salt, as it may bear an
egg) gal. 1. VValnut-tree-leaves, Bayleaves, Time, A. M. j: Ginger in gross
powder, Dill seed, Coriander-seed bruised, A. iss. white Pepper bruised j.
Cloves, Mace, A. ij. boil all these together, and let them stand till they are
almost cold; then put the pickle to the Cucumers aforesaid, and they will be
good to eat in a few days: after 14 days or three weeks, the Pickle ought to be
taken out, boiled, scummed and put in again.

16. To preserve or pickle Sampire.

You must make a Pickle, like that in the last way of pickling Cucumbers, save
here instead of water to make your gallon of Brine withal, you must use white
Wine: in this Pickle the Sampire is to be scalded: when the Vessel is taken
off from the fire, cover it with a cloth to keep the steam in, for about a
quarter of an hour, or somewhat more, so will it be tender: but if it be
desired to be hard, and not to be boiled again, cover it not at all: then take
the Sampire out of the liquor, and let both cool by themselves: after put them
up in an earthen or stone Jar, which stop close and cover with Rosin or Wax,
and keep it for use.

Here is to be noted, that Sampire may be preserved without scalding, but then
when it is used, it must be boiled.

17. To preserve or pickle Broom Buds.

Put them into an earthen, stone or glass Jar, and put upon them the Pickle
before mentioned for Sampire: stop the Vessel close with cork and wax, and
shake it once a day, for fourteen or fifteen days; then will they be sunk:
after six or eight weeks, you may pour off the former pickle, and put to them
this: white Wine Vinegar the best, gal. ij. leaves of Time, M.j. Ginger,
Coriander seed, Dill seed bruised, A. vj. white Pepper broken in pieces iiij.
Cloves, Mace, A. j. boil all these together, and put the Pickle to the broom
buds: but it will be good to boil the Vinegar first very well, and at the end
of the boiling to put in the spices, giving them a walm or two.

After this manner may you pickle, Capers, French Beans, and other the like
things.

18. To preserve or pickle Purslane.

Purflane with its stalks, boil them tender in fair water, and lay them a
drying or draining: this done, put it into an Earthen, Stone, or Glass Jar, and
pickle them, as we have before taught you to pickle Broom budds. Or thus, Being
boiled and dried, as aforesaid, between linen cloths, cover them with the best
white Wine Vinegar, mixed with Salt, but put not in so much Salt as for
Cucumers; lastly, stop the mouth of the Vessel with Cork, and Wax or Rosin
melted upon it, as before.

19. To preserve or pickle Mushrooms.

Take Mushrooms, such as grow upon gravelly places, are of the last nights
growth, and underneath are of a kind of Salmon color, as you gather them, put
them into a pitcher of fair water, to preserve them white: being brought home
to dress, cut the great ones in halves or quarters, seeing carefully that there
be no worms in them, and peel off their upper skin on the top; the little ones
peel whole: as you peel them, cast them into a Basin of fair water, which
preserves them white: then put them into an Earthen or Coppertinn'd Sauce Pan;
putting to two quarts of them, a pint or half a pint of white Wine, Cider or
Perry, and about two spoonfuls or more of Salt: boil them with a quick fire,
and scum them well all the while, taking away the filth as it arises. They will
sink into a very little room, when they are so boiled as to be tender, which
will be in little more than a quarter of an hour: then put them into a
Collander to drain their moisture from them: being well drained, put them into
an Earthen, Stone, or Glass Jar, pouring upon them this following Pickle. of
the best white Wine Vinegar, a quart: broken or bruised Pepper two spoonfuls:
Nutmegs bruised ij. Time j. Cloves bruised No xxx. Mace, Coriander seed, A. ss.
Bay leaves broken into bits No jv. boil the Vinegar first, toward the end of
boiling, put in the Spices, and give them two or three walms, then take it from
the fire and let it cool. Being quite cold, put it to the Mushrooms (being cold
also) in the Jar; which stop up close with Cork, and melted Wax or Rosin: in
about fourteen days they will have taken in the full taste of the pickle, and
will keep good about half a year; but be sure you have pickle enough to cover
the Mushrooms, else they cannot all of them be good: In four, five, or six
months time, you may shift the pickle, and put on new, so will they keep a year
or more.

20. To preserve or pickle Oysters.

Take a quart of Oysters freed from their liquor, wash them in fair water, stew
them in a Sawce-pan, with their own liquor, poured off from its filth, and a
pint of white Wine Vinegar, adding Cloves bruised j. Limon Peels ss. Coriander
seed bruised j. simmer them all together with a little Salt for half an hour;
then put them into a Jar or other Vessel, which stop close and keep for use: in
four or five days they will be fit to eat, and look white.

21. To preserve or pickle Oysters another way.

Take a quart of Oysters, wash them clean in their own liquor, then let it
settle; and put your Oysters to it, adding of the best white Wine Vinegar a
pint, and Pepper broken or bruised j. Mace bruised ss: Cloves bruised j. Salt a
little, as you please; boil all over a fire leisurely, till they are pretty
tender, (scumming them all along as the Scum arises:) when they are enough,
take them out till the Pickle is cold, then put them up, and stop them as
aforesaid: they will keep well in Caper barrels, and be good six or eight weeks.

22. To preserve or pickle Oysters another way.

In opening the Oysters put them by themselves, and the liquor by it self: let
it settle, pour off the clear, to which add half its quantity of Brine (made of
water and salt, with Bay leaves, or other hot Herbs:) into this mixture put the
Oysters, and let them simmer over the fire, so long till the Oyster is of a
white color, and till the sins begin to shrivel or contract, then take them
off the fire, and out of their liquor, laying them singly till they are cold,
and likewise the liquor cold, after put them up in Barrels or Jars, and stop
them close as aforesaid.

23. To preserve or pickle a Breast of Veal.

Boil it first in fair water, so much as will cover it, then take it off and
let it cool: Take of this Broth 2 quarts: of the best white Wine Vinegar, one
quart: white Wine one pint: Cloves bruised, Mace bruised, biting Cinnamon in
bits, A. j. put all these together, and boil them, and when it is cold, put the
Breast of Veal (cut into fit pieces) into the same, in a proper Vessel, as a
little Barrel or Jar, which stop up It will be fit for eating in a Week, and
will keep three Months in Summer time.

Thus you may preserve other meats, being first boiled, and when cold to be cut
into slices, of one Inch and a half thick, and so put into the Pickle.

24. To preserve flesh another way.

Take of the best Buttock Beef; Prok flesh (some say the Belly pieces, pared
off the Ribs, others of the lean of the leg of Pork:) A. lbvj. Beef Suet lbiij.
(but if you use the lean of the Leg of Pork, then you must have Beef Suet
lbiiij ss. or more:) Cloves, mace, nutmegs, cinnamon, all in gross powder, A.
ss. leaves of red Sage, Penny Royal, Time; A. j. first Patboyl the meat over a
gentle fire, for an hour; being cold shred it small by it self: after shred the
Beef Suet by it self; then the Herbs by themselves: mix all together, Meat,
Suet, Herbs and Spice, with Salt enough to season them, or give them a good
relish, chopping them small, then put them up in prepared Ox Guts, after smoke
or dry the Sausages three or four days, in a Tin stove, over a Saw Dust fire.

Here is to be noted, 1. That these Sausages are those so much famed and known
by the name of Bononia or Polonia Sausages. 2. That the Ox Gut are thus fitted
or prepared: Being emptied of their Dung, put them into fair water and Salt,
cut them into several pieces, and turn the inside outward with a stick, for
three or four days together, washing them till they become white, then put in
the flesh, pressing it in hard and tie it up. 3. That being thus made (without
any other dressing) to be eaten cold with Mustard. 4. That the said Tin Stove
or Frame might be used and placed in a Chimney in form of a Cup-board, but
without a bottom, with two doors, the one at the bottom (with a Pidgeon hole in
it) to open and make a Saw-Dust and Small-Coal-Dust fire, to be kindled or
enlivened with straw, and to draw in Air at the hole aforesaid, which may have
a little door to prevent Cats: the Top thereof may be firm Tin, with a nossel
or pipe in it, like that of a pair of Bellows, covered over to prevent foot, to
which and on ledges athwart diverse hooks to be hung, the said Sawsages, as also
sheeps and hoggs tongues may be hung and dried: Collins, Salt and Fishery. p.
110. and 136. 5. But where this is wanting, if they be hung up in a Chimny
where a very great fire is continually kept every day, it may dry them well
enough to serve this present purpose.

powder of the roots of Dragon-wort (or Aron) ij. white Arsenick j. Soot, black

reduce the Arsnick to most fine powder, pour upon it S. V. digest it three days
in a hot place, then decant the spirit, and pour on new spirit, repeating the
same five times, wash it with water and dry it. Then mix the powder of the
roots and Arsaick with the Soot, according to Art.

The Invention of this was by Hartman, for the Cure of Cancers, which is (the
Ulcer being cleansed) to be once, and but once strewed thereon, unless it be
taken off too soon, before the roots thereof are eradicated: lay over it oyled
Cloth, moistened with fasting spittle, that it may stick. This procures great
pain, but it is not to be removed, till the Cancer and its roots are eradicated,

14. Pulvis Admirabilis, The Wonderful Powder.

choice Scammony viij. Cremor Tartari vj. Gutta Gamba, Crocus Metallorum, A.
iiij. each being in fine powder, mix and searse them together.

It is a strong Vomit, but a most admirable thing in all stubborn, fixed,
chronick and violent Diseases, in the Gout, Sciatica, Dropsy, Jaundice,
Rheumatism, Megrim, Vertigo, Lethargy, inveterate Headache, there is no better
Remedy: but it ought to be given with caution, and to strong bodies, or where
the Disease otherwise is desperate. Dose a gr. x. ad xviij. in the morning
fasting, in a little Broth, Syrup, Pap of an Apple, Honey, or some such like
thing. During the working hereof, let the sick drink plentifully, broth made
fresh, but well seasoned with Salt, at time of taking of it. I sometimes use
the Composition thus: Scammony ix. Gutta Gamba vj. Tartar Vitriolate iiij.
Crocus Metallorum iij. mix them. It is an excellent Composition, works
exceeding well, but nothing near so violent as the former.

15. Pulvis ex tribus, Powder of three things.

It is good in Gouts and Dropsies, the Jaundice, and all watery humors, which

Quicksilver, Sal-prunellae, A. j. rub them together till the Quick silver is
perfectly poudred: then to that powder add in fine powder Scammony, Cambogia,
A. j. Elaterium ss. mix them well together.

It purges all humors, and is profitably given in the Gout, Dropsy, Jaundice
and French Pox, as also in pains and aches; but it ought to be given with great
caution, for fear of michief, or some dreadful symptoms: if given by a Learned
hand, it may kill Worms in Children. But here is to be noted, that some in
stead of Sal Prunellae, use the same quantity of flowers of Sulphur.

17. Palvis Hessij, H^ssius his Powder against the Plague.

Camphir, sugar Candy, A. j. Ginger ij. make a fine powder: This is the true
Composition, but it will be better if you make it thus: Camphir, Rezoar
Mineral, A. j. Cochinele, Ginger, A. jss. make a powder as aforesaid.

It is an admirable Antidote against the Plague, being given ad j, or ss in
Treacle Water, Treacle Vinnegar, or the King of Poland's Vinegar, and so to be
in Bed, and to sweat upon it.

Camphir j. Bezoar Mineral, powder of Vipers, C^chinele, Saffron, flowers of
Sulphur, Carlina, Petasites, A. ss. make each a sine powder apart, then mix
them.

The Virtues, use and Dose are the same with the former, save this is the more
powerful, and the better Composition.

19. Pulvis sudorificus Barbetti, Barbets Sweating Powder.

Flos sulphuris, Autimony Diaphoretick, salt of Carduus, sal Prunellae, A. j.
make all into a fine powder.

It is an excellent thing to provoke Sweat; and the Author ordered it to be
given to such as were troubled with the Scabs. It is certainly a good thing.
Dose ij.

20. Pulvis restorativus Barbetti, The restoring powder of Barbet.

Comfry roots, sine Alaes, Quicklime, A. ij. Mastich, Myrrh, Mummy, A. ij.
precipitate ij, make all into a powder.

It is an excellent thing to incarnate, conglutinate, dry and heal: but in my
Opinion the proportion of the Precipitate is too large, iiiss. is enough.

21. Pulvis Agricolae, Agricola's Astringent powder.

Sacharum Saturni, Olibanum, red Myrrh, A. i. Saffron, Camphir, A. j. powder
and mix, which wet often with Frog spawn water, letting it dry every time.

It is designed to stop bleeding, having the Virtues of that of Crollius, in
Our Pharmacopoea, lib. 4. cap. 21. sect. 76.

22. Pulvis Astringens, A powder stopping Blood.

sine Aloes, fine Bole, sanguis Draconis, Frankincense, Myrrh, A. j. powder
them small, and put thereto the Ashes of an old Hat burnt ss.

It is designed to stop the flux of Blood in Wounds or otherwise, for which it
is an exceeding good thing, you may use it as we have directed in Our Synopsis
Medicinae, lib. 3. cap. 25. sect. 20.

23. Pulvis Stypticus Mindereri, Mindererus his powder stopping Blood.

Man's Blood (or in place thereof) Lambs or Sheeps Blood, a sufficient quantity;
let it stand in a clean earthen Vessel, till the Serum be parted from it, which

powder it. Take of this powder iiij. burnt Alum, sine Tragacanth in powder, A.
j. Crocus Martis or red Earth of Vitriol, out of which the Salt is extracted
vj. mix and keep them for use.

It prevails in stopping all fluxes of Blood whatsoever, if the flux is so
impetuous as that it washes it away in the the first application, wipe the
Wound again, and strew it on the second time thicker and firmer, then bind up
the Wound with Emplastrum santalinum, or Ceratum ex pelle Arietina. The Author
prescribed only Sheeps or Lambs Blood; but we by our own Experience have found
it much more effectual, being prepared with Mans-blood, which is indeed also a
kind of Mummy.

24. Pulvis Sternutatorius Deckeri, Deckers sneezing Powder.

Turpethum Minerale, gr. x. Liquorice powder ss. mix, and make a very fine
powder.

The Author gave it with success in a Lethargy, which moved at first time a
little sneezing, after the sick found a pain in the Head, and a little burning:
the next day a little more of it was blown up his Nostrils, upon which there
followed so great a quantity of Pus, mixed with Blood, both from Nostrils and
Mouth, that he says, that unless he had seen it with his Eyes, he could not
have believed it: This powder he used during the whole Cure, which in ashort
time was accomplished. We have also cured two of an Amaurosis with the same.

25. Pulvis ad suffocationem Matricis. A powder for Fits of the Mother.

Magistery of English Tin, salt of Amber, Salt of Hearts horn, red Coral
prepared, A. jss. rectified Oil of Amber j. mix, and keep for use.

of the sit; taking it also three or four mornings after, to prevent its return.

26. Pulvis Hystericus, A powder for the Womb.

The Callous of Horse-Leggs ij. Assa Faetida, horn and hoof of a Goat, A. ij.
reduce them into a gross powder.

It is one of the most certain and speedy remedies against the Suffocation of
the Womb, or fits of the Mother. Cast about j. hereof upon live Coals, and let
the sick receive the smoke into the parts affected through a Funnel.

crude Sulphur, white Arsenick, crude Antimony, A. ij. the Sulphur being melted

Antimony in powder, which mix till they are incorporated with the Sulphur and
look red: then of this mixture j. Caput Mortuum of Vitriol ss. mix and make a
powder, which wash six times in S.V. and dry it for use.

The intention of this powder, is to make Issues with, which it does without
pain; for which cause we commend it to all the lovers of Art. By the Opinion of
some Learned and Experienced Chyrurgians, it much exceeds the Lapis Infernalis,
for the facility and easiness of its Operation. Issues are often made in the
Joints; but oftener between the Joints. In the Arms between the Muscles Deltois
and Biceps. In the Thigh two fingers breadth above the Knee, on the inside. In
the Leg (the upper part) two fingers breadth below the Knee. Or (in the lower
part) two or three fingers breadth above the Ankle. This Caustic is much to be
commended also in Excrescencies, and in sordid and cancerous Ulcers.

uncorrected; otherwise only downwards. By reason of the Mercurius Dulcis, the
Humors are made both more slippery, and the Emetick is also much corrected
thereby. It may be given to alt Ages and Sexes. To Children you may give gr.
vj. in the pap of an Apple, increasing the Dose according to age and strength,
ad j. or more. It cures all intermitting Fevers to a Wonder.

through an Alembick, in an indifferent sand heat, reiterating the distillation
each time by Cohobation. Upon the powder at bottom, put S.V. rectified, which
abstract from it six times; then Calcine the powder in a Crucible, almost to a
red hot heat, by putting the fire above and below, and round about it; then mix
it with double weight of Scammony.

Rolfincius, the Author of this Medicine, says, that this is the Fever
frighter of Riverius; but it corresponds not in all its parts with his
Description, and the Nature of a true Febrisuge. Yet certainly it is an
admirable thing against all sorts of Fevers, taking away the morbifick matter,
both by Vomit and Stool. Dose a gr. x. ad j. in Conserve, Sugar, or Honey of
Roses, or other fit Vehicle.

Mercury.

purified Quicksilver, grind it well with Niter, Vitriol calcined, and Alum
calcined ana: sublime the Mercury in a Cucurbit, in the head will ascend white
flowers, which are useless, and to be cast away: by the sides of the body will
stick yellow Flowers, which separate apart, and on the Caput Mortuum will lie
Mercury sublimed red as Cinnabar, which carefully take off: grind the said red
Mercury, and likewise the yellow, with fresh Niter, Vitriol and Alum, subliming
the Mercury as before, which repeat again the third time. This done, take (in
the third sublimation) the red Mercury only (which lay on the Caput Mortuum)
grind it with equal quantity of flowers of Sulphur and sal Armoniack sublimed
from Calcined Vitriol; being all well ground together, set them to sublime in a
sublimatory glass, and what sublimes grind again with what remained unsublemed,
and sublime as before; which work of grinding and subliming, reiterate five
times; so will the Mercury be found in the bottom of the glass of a very deep
red color.

This is a true diaphoretick Mercury, very powerful in extirpating all
obnectious humors in the body. It cures perfectly a Perepnumonia, Empyema, and
a Pleurisy, and that without Blood-letting; dissolves all coagulated Bodies,
and roots out the very essence of the Pox, Gout, Scurvy, Leprosy, and many
other inveterate Diseases. Dose a gr. vj. ad xij.

keep in a glass close stopped for use.

This powder is repleat with Volatile Salt, (with which this Animal abounds) by
virtue of which it penetrates and opens all the pores in Man's Body, even in the

consume the Body, as Obstructions of the Spleen, Melancholy, tedious Agues,

other Diseases of the Lungs. It restores plumpness of the Body, makes fleshy,
nourishes much preserves the natural heat, and restores the radicial humidity.
It is also a notable Counter-poyson, and very prevalent against Epidemical
Distempers, as well to prevent, as overcome all occult and malignant Venoms,
especially those of the Viper, and bitings of all sorts of Serpents. Dose a gr.
x. ad j. or ss. and sometimes to j. in a morning fasting, in Broth, Wine,
Conserve, or other Cordial Vehicle. It works by insensible transpiration, not
provoking Sweat, unless the D^se be great. You may give it for a Month or two
together. If you make the powder into Balls with Gelly of Vipers, and so dry
them, it will keep the better and longer.

water, and wash with the Water; I assure you it is no mean thing.

Take many Iron Plates, and lay them out in the Dew for a good while, that they
may rust strongly; gather this Rust, and expose them as before, thus do till
you have powder enough.

1. Here is to be noted, that Iron is better than Steel, because it is more
easily dissolved, and so better yields its Salt in which the Virtue lies. 2.
That though this preparation is long, yet it is much better than all the
Preparations extant of the opening Crocus. 3. That the Dew is impregnated with
the Powers of Heaven, and with a dissolvent that opens mightily the body of the
Iron, so that embodying its self with it, it makes the Mars more active and
soluble than it was before. 4. It is excellent for Obstructions of the Liver,
Spleen and Mesentery and Pancreas, cures the Green Sickness, helps the stoppage
of the Terms, Dropsies, Cachexies, and other Diseases proceeding from
Obstructions. Dose a gr. vj. ad ij. in Lozenges, Electuaries, or some purging
Bolus: but you ought always to purge and moisten the person you give it to,
with some proper Purge, and with broths, lest finding the passages of the small
Vessels silled and obstructed, it should make yet greater obstructions, and
causes Inflammations and pains much like to she Cholick.

reason of the additions of the Pilulae Aloephangino, and the Tartar Vitriolate,
the Laudanum cannot bind the Belly, in such sort as when it is given alone.

CHAP. XXIV. Of TROCHES.

Terrae Cimiolae, or Sigillatae lbij: red Saunders lbiiij: burnt Ivory lbiij
ss: Oriental Bezoar xx: Lignum Aloes x: burnt Silk viij: Ambergrise vj: Pearls
prepared iiij: yellow Saunders iij: Musk, Gallia Moschata, Mastich, Calamus
Aromaticus, Galangal, Cinnamon, Rhubarb, red Coral, fine Bole, Wormwood,
Myrobalans, Chebulan and Bellerick, Aloes, washed with juice of Roses, A. ij:
powder what is to be poudred very fine, and being moistened with some few drops
of Balsam, odoriferous Wine, and Cinnamon Water, let them be aryed in the
shadow, and then made up with a sufficient quantity of fine and white Sugar:
soften all till they become a lump of Clay as it were, very clammy, roapy, and
exceeding red: of which (as of China Dish stuff) many things are shaped, and
vessels framed, which Merchants carry from the East Indies, to sundry parts of
the World, especially to Lisbon in Portugal: what I have seen of it, was in the
form of Tablets or Troches, with a certain Seal and Inscription, by which it
was pretended that they wrought also Magically.

This Antidote is used by the Princes of India and Noble Men of China,
especially to move Venery, for it wonderfully provokes Lust, and strengthens
the procreative Virtue, or Genital and Seminal parts, being thus used. They
hold a bit in their Mouths, as big as a lentil, whence a sweet and odoriferous
Liquor and scent does flow. It strengthens the Stomach, discusses Wind,
powerfully helps Melancholic Diseases, settles a trembling Heart, is exceeding
available for pains at Stomach, falling sickness, and cold Diseases of the
Nerves. It refreshes the Vital and Animal Spirits, strengthens all the
Faculties, defends the Brain, is good against Poison, and the chief remedy in
the World against a stinking Breath. It preserves the symmetry of the natural
heat, delays Death, and makes a long Life, being sold at a very great rate. It
strengthens to admiration, being chiefly taken by the Viceroys, and Princes of
India. Thus Zacutus Lucitanus, in his Prax. admirand. Lib. 2. Obs. 6. We know
it to be an Antidote against all sorts of Poison, Plague, and Pestilential
Fevers, Smallpox, Measles, all sorts of Melancholy, Atrophia's, Hecticks, and
other wasting or pinings of the Body. Dose a gr. xij. ad j. and sometimes ad

There are various ways, Ingredients, and Proportion, extant, in order to the
making up of this Compositum, among which two are chief, viz. that which we
have exhibited in Our Pharmacop, Lib. 4. Cap. 24. Sect. 63. and this which we
have incerted here. They were described both of them, by Antonio Colminero of
Ledesma in Spain, a Doctor of Physic, whose Descriptions we have followed in
both places, with some small alterations, chiefly in the Aniseeds, in the
Dispensatory it is vij: here it is iv only: they that sancy not the Aniseeds may
put in the less: It is a great restorer of Nature, and therefore good against
Consumptions and Hecticks. The manner and Practice of using of it, you must
search out in our Pharmacopoea, the place afore-cited. In the making up hereof,
if the dissolution of a little Gum Tragacanth in Rose Water be added, the body
will be the more firm, keep better, and more strongly resist the Intromission
of the Air, which otherwise it would be the more subject to.

The Troches of Coral in Our Pharm. lib. 4. cap. 24. sect. 42. are from Galen,

styptick, these are most Cordial; these being taken in a morning fasting are
prevalent against Wind, the Coeliack passion, and the Bloody Flux.

powder, A. ij. Corrosive sublimate in fine powder ij. juice of two large Limons
or iiij. in which dissolve the sublimate, make the Almonds into Milk with the
Water, strain, and therewith mix the Camphir, (first dissolved in a little
thereof) then the Ceruse, lastly the dissolved sublimate.

It is an excellent thing to cleanse the Skin of all manner of Impurities, as
Scabs, Itch, Pimples, Freckles, Sunburnings, Spots, Redness, Yellowness,
Scurff, Morphew, and such other like Deformities, only by washing therewith
morning and Evening: put a little out into an earthen thing (not any thing of
Metal) and therewith wash, but beware that you let it not touch either Eyes or
Teeth.

2. Liquor Cosmeticus, A Beautifying Liquor.

of the Galls of Oxen or Bulls lbiiij. digest twenty four hours in B.M. adding
Roch Alum, Sandiver, or Salt of Glass poudred, A. j. mix, and put them into a
glass Mattress, which stop close: expose all to the Sun (in the midst of Summer)
for 14 days, shaking the glass every day; then filterate. In the filterated
Liquor, put Venice Talk (poudred fine, and dissolved in Spirit of Vinegar, from
Spanish Wine) ij. Borax, Sperma Caeti, A. j. Sugar Candy iij. Camphir, sweet
Sublimate, A. ss. then expose them to the Sun again for fourteen days more;
shaking the Glass often every day: Lastly, filterate, and keep it for use.

Spring Water: let it stand twenty four hours, now and then stirring it with a
wooden Spatula, until the whole Liquor grows black, then silter it through
brown Paper, so will it be clear; keep it in a Glass for use.

It helps admirably all cutaneous Diseases and deformities, as Freckles,
Lentils, Macula Materna, redness, Worms, etc. for it drives away the humors
within the little Pores, dissolves the inveterate and stubborn combination of
Salts and Sulphurs, and restores the whole Skin (though evilly framed, as to
its Pores) making it well colored. Wherefore it is useful, not only to cleanse
the spots of the Face, but also to take away wheals and its redness, as also
the Disease called Erysipela's. Particularly for Worms in the Face with black
Heads, it is an appropriate Remedy above all others: yet it ought not to be
used too familliarly, least by the constancy thereof, it should fall into the
Pores, and insinuating it self with the Blood and nervous Liquor, should
prejudice their temperaments, and so imprint on the Brain, or on the
Praecordia, a virulency never to be wiped out.

4. Liquor seu Vinum Cosmeticum, A beautifying Wine.

Camphir sliced ij. bruise it in a Glass Mortar, and offuse thereon leisurely,
the juice of one Limon: after add White Wine lbj. strain it, letting the

Spots, and other discolorings from the Skin.

Aqua Vitae (but the Cephalic Water of Millius, in Our Pharmacopoeia, Lib. 4.
Cap. 1. Sect. 39. is better) lbj. the whites of New laid Eggs No. vj. shake
them a great while together, with 10 or 12 lumps of Alum, about the bigness of
a large Nutmeg, in a well glazed earthen 'Pot, till it is white like Milk.

This Milk is of eminent use for easing pains of the Gout, by outward
application: thus, With six spoonfuls of this Milk (being so warmed as to take
off the cold) mix two spoonfulls of Red Wine (warmed by it self also) that is
the best Alicant: In this mixture dip linen cloths, and apply them warm to the
part afflicted: it gives present ease, and is eminent against all other pains
and inflammations whatsoever.

Rue, Plantane, Pennyroyal, A. M. j. boil all together for a quarter of an
hour, then strain it, and dissolve therein Honey of Roses ij. Verdigrise j.
strain again, and keep it for use.

It cures all sorts of Ulcers of the Mouth, Throat, and Nostrills, and in all
other parts of he Body, as well Scorbutic as Venereal: you may wash the Ulcers
with Cotton or Lint, dipped in the Water.

9. Liquor Aluminis Mindereri, Alum Water of Mindererus.

Roch Alum, q.s. powder it, and put it into a Hogs Bladder, tying it close. Put
it into a Kettle of hot Water, till the Water is dissolved: this solution bring
over the Helm in a low Retort, distilling to dryness; taking heed, that you so
urge not the fire, as to force over the corrosive Spirits from it. The Feces or
Caput Mort. put into a Bladder, and dissolve as before, then distill again. This
work so often repeat, till the whole body of the Alum is brought over the Helm.
Lastly, filterate the Liquor, and keep it in a glass close stopped for use.

This Water is Styptick, good in a Gonorrhaea, and the whites in Women, but
designed by the Author chiefly for the stopping of Blood, in any kind of
Hemorrhage, which he kept as a peculiar Secret. Mindererus says, that this
Liquor is so strong, that it is able to draw the Veins together, without
corrosion, being applied to Wounds, or any bleeding part: you may also mix with
it Tragacanth, Gum Arabic, Sanguis Draconis and Glair of Eggs. But you are to
observe whether the Patient has heated himself in Storming a place, or by any
other kind of Exercise, or otherwise is distempered with passion, for so long
as this lasts, the blood is in an Ebulition and rage, and is then stopped with
more difficulty. In this case, stop the Wound with Peacocks Dung, then dip
pledgets in the former mixture, and apply them cold to the Wound, and the
bleeding will cease.

10. Liquor Stypticus, The Astringent Liquor.

Fine Bole ij: Roman Vitriol a little calcined, or till it is gray, j; Camphir
ss: Plantain water lb jv: mix them and keep them in a Vessel close stopped for
use: you may mix the Camphir in powder with the Vitriol in powder, and so
calcine them.

It is an admirable thing in diseases of the Eyes, to stop all fluxions of
Humors, to ease Pains, help the Gout, dry up Rhumes, and cure old Ulcers, and
other hollow and running sores.

11. Liquor ad morbum oculorum, An admirable eywater.

Bean-flowers, Endiveflowers, Eyebright, A. lbjss Rosemary-flowers,
Comfryflowers, Red Roses, A. lb j. mix and prepare them according to Art; then
distill them in a gentle B.M. to every quart of which water add Niter ss.

It is an excellent liquor for the Eyes, cures Rheums, and helps almost any
infirmity of them, yea some have been helped of blindness by the use thereof:
wash the Eyes therewith 5 or 6 times a day: take it also inwardly morning and
evening to iij or jv.

12. Liquor stypticus Paracelsi, The Specific styptick of Paracelsus.

The Quintessences of fine Bole, of Iron, and of Amber, A. lb j: digest in
Ashes for a Month; then put into it dried Tartar in fine powder lb j ss: mix
them, and with this cure the Body where need requires.

This and such like Specificks are not searchable, (whilst in their bodies) but
in their separated substances do attract more than is credible, because of the
nature and quality of their most great dryness, and therefore are they called
specific Stypticks, as being styptick above and beyond all others.

13. Liquor Vulnerarius Paracelsi, The specific Vulnerary liquor of Paracelsus.

Samech well burnt, and calcined to Whiteness, to which add circulatum minus;
then afterward distill it, that a most dry Caput Mort. may remain in the
bottom, and that the Glass be wholly red hot: then pour on fresh Circulatum
again, as before: thus do so long till the Circulatum comes off altogether
sweet therefrom, as it is in its self; then let it resolve by it self: what
resolves is the Remedy here spoken of.

We shall not, says Paracelsus, make any singular description of the Virtues
of this Medicament, but do make this general Assertion, That it is fit for all
Wounds, as being that with which we have cured many hundred of wounds withal by
a bare washing, and that above what is credible to be don by nature; for it
knits the lips and sides of Wounds together, as two pieces of boards are with
Glue, which is done with the greatest Siccity and stiptickness as may be, to
serve for the flesh only.

14. Liquor ad Vlcera Parace^si, The Specific Liquor for Ulcers.

of the former Liquor; made in like manner of rust of Iron, A. lbj: mix them,
and add thereto Oleum Alartis lb j ss: all being thoroughly permixt, digest six
months ever a gentle heat in Sand, then keep it for use.

With this you are daily to wash Ulcers, as you shall see need, applying over a
consolidative plaster, proceeding also with proper Ligatures, to the end of the
Cure; for this is to be heeded, That the Members are to be (as it were) drawn
together or compressed with Ligatures, which thing we largely enough teach in
other places.

15. Aqua Mercurialis Paracelsi, The Mercurial Water of Paracelsus.

Mercury seven times sublimed (with Vitriol, Niter and Alum) lb iij: Sal
Armoniack clear and white, thrice sublimed, (from Common salt) lb j ss: both of
them being ground together, and alch^lized, sublime them together in a
sublimatory, in sand, for nine hours: Let all cool, then take off the Sublimate
with a Feather, and sublime it with the remainder, as before: repeat this
operation four times, until it will sublime no more, and the mass remains
black in the bottom, and flowring like to wax: cool it, take it out, grind it
again, and put it into a glass d^sh, and imbibe it often times with the Water
of Sal Armoniack (but let it be the prepared water) and let it coagulate of its
own Accord, and then again imbibe it, and dry it, even till 9 or 10 times,
until it will be almost no more coagulated: after grind it subtly upon a
Marble, and dissolve it in a moist place, into a clear liquor or water, the
which rectify by distillation in Ashes from all feces, and keep it for use.

This water reduces Melancholy Bodies into their first Matter, viz. into
running Mercury, such a Mercury as it was in the center of the Earth, before
the Generation of Metals, to wit, a moist and viscous Vapor, containing in it
the Mercury and Sulphur of Nature invisibly, which are the Principles of all
the Metals; and such a Mercury is of unspeakable Virtues, and possesses divine
Secrets, of this our Mercurial Water viij, put thereinto leaves of fine Sol or
Luna j: digest in hot Ashes in a glass close stopped for eight hours: so shall
you see the body of Sol or Luna in the bottom of the Vessel, transmuted into a
subtle Vapor or Mercury: the solution being made of the whole Mercurial Water,
separate it from the first matter by sublimation in an Alembeck, with a gentle
fire; and keep it in a glass close stopped: By this means thou shall have the
true Mercury of a body, the use whereof in desperate Cases (provided it be
wisely used) is miraculous and caelestial, and therefore not to be revealed to
the unworthy.

16. Balneum artificiale; ubi thermae naturales desunt, An Artificial Bath,
imitating the natural.

the purest Niter you can get, dissolve it in rain water, so as that the Water
may imbibe as much of it, as it can. Put this Nitrous salt into a common
earthen vessel unglazed, which set in a Cellar. This Vessel in a short time
will be white all over on the outside, as with a hoar frost, which whiteness is
partly the flowers of the Niter being the purest part thereof, penetrating the
Vessel, and partly the Nitrous air, condensed into Niter, by the coldness of
the Vessel, and assimulated to the Niter penetrating the Vessel. And indeed
such is the coldness of an earthen Vessel, wherein Niter is dissolved in Water,
that it will, being set in Snow (though by the fire side) be forthwith frozen.
These aforesaid flowers of Niter strike off with a feather, and when you have a
good quantity of them, as lb iij, jv, or v. put them into Bolt heads ( lb j, in
each bolt head) so that two parts of three be empty: nip them up, and set them
in Ashes, and give a reasonable strong fire, viz. such that the upper part of
the Ball of the Bolt-head be as hot as you can well suffer your hand upon it;
and you shall see that the Niter will be dissolved every day by little and
little; and in two or three months time be wholly dissolved, and become acid;
but not so acid as its spirit made by distillation;) then put it into a glass
Gourd with a Head, and distill it off, and in the bottom you will find an acid
nitrous Salt, almost fluxil. Put the destilled water now drawn upon the said
Salts, and keep it for use. When you would make a hot Bath, Take your
proportion of Fountain Water, and make it sufficiently acid with this nitrous
Liquor; then put upon it a sufficient quantity of the best Sulphur Mine, or
Sulphur vivum, in a large wooden Vessel, where the sick, is to be bathed, viz.
a Bathing Tub, and the water will presently be heated so hot, as is possible to
be endured.

The use of this Bath is for all such evil affects as are in the habit of the
Body, and out of the Veins; as Palfies, Convulsions, Catarrhs, Rheums, fluxes
of cold Humors, running Pains and Aches in the Bones, discolorings of the
Skin, etc. for it resolves, discusses, cleanses, mollifies, and gives ease, in
the extremities of dolor and grief. It may also be taken inwardly to dissolve
gross and viscous Humors, open Obstructions, cleanse the Reins and Bladder, of
the Stone, Gravel, or other glutinous matter, stopping the passages, and to
help all affects of the Womb, proceeding from cold and moisture, Wind and
filthy Humors, as Whites, etc. but this observe in the inward use, that the
Water be drunk warm, and in a good quantity, least it do more hurt than good.

17. Liquor Viticulorum, Liquor of Vine Branches.

Ly of the Ashes of Vine Branches lbj. Common Salt, sharpest Wine Vinegar, A.
j: Niter j ss: mix, dissolve, and keep it for use.

It is an extreme good thing against all sorts of Inflammations, chiefly such as
are Oedematous or Erysipelas-like, (St. Anthonies Fire) which for the most part
invade the Limbs, and are very hard to cure. Scultetus says, he never
Experienced a better Remedy. After general Remedies, dip a double Linen Cloth
in this Liquor luke warm, and apply it to the part affected, binding it on with
Rowlers, it does wonderfully drink in, and discuss in three, or at most in four
days time, great dangerous swelling, threatening great mortification. A German
Chyrurgian communicated it to Spigelus, and he to Scultetus.

shake it well three or four times a day, for ten days, then let it settle, and
keep it quiet upon the Faeces, for use.

It is inferior to no Eye-water extant, but eases all manner of Pains, and
cures diseases of the Eyes to a Miracle. It takes away suffusions, Clouds,
Pearls, Blood-shot, only by washing therewith, three or four times a day: It
cures sore Eyes, running Eyes, Salt, Hot and Sharp Rheums in the Eyes, Ulcers,
Fistula's, etc. and has made several to see which have been blind many years.

CHAP. II. Of OILS.
1 OLeum Viperinum, Oil of Vipers.

live Vipers, such as are strong, large and fat, No xxj. of the best Oil of
Hypericon lbiij ss: Spanish or Rhenish Wine iiij: put the Oil into an earthen
Pot, well glazed, having a narrow mouth; boil it in B.M. till it is so hot,
that you cannot endure your finger in it; then put in the Vipers one after
another, and when they are stifled, put in the Wine, cover the Pot, and make it
boil, till the moisture of the Vipers is almost consumed: then strain and press
forth the Oil, and the faeces being afterward settled, decant the Oil, and keep
it in a close Vessel for use.

It Is of admirable use for Scabs, Itch, Tettars, Ringworms, Scurff, Morphew,
Leprosy, Evil Ulcers, breakings out, and most deformities of the Skin,
especially such as proceed from a Venereal Cause. It eases the pain of the
Gout, and the Haemorrhoids, and if the whole Region of the Belly be anointed
with it, it gives ease in the Cholick, and facilitates the Delivery of Women.

2. Oleum Castorei Nostrum, Our Oil of Castor.

Caestor, Euphorbium, Myrrh, white Pepper, A. j: Oil Olive xl: Spanish wine
xij: boil to the consumption of the Wine; but the better way is to make an
Extraction with Oil of Turpentine, and then to mix it with the Oil Olive.

It is good against all pains and cold afflictions of the Brain and Nerves; it
is good against the Headache, Trembling, Palsy and cold Fits of Fevers, by
anointing the Back bone with it; It is also good against the Gout and Sciatica.

3. Oleum Bufonum Hartmanni, Oil of Toads of Hartman.

three or four living Toads, boil them a whole hour in Oil Olive lbij: strain
it, and keep it for use.

This Oil is of wonderful Virtues against Pimples, Morphew, Freckles,
Sunburning, Wheals and Redness of the Skin or Face: anoint the Skin once a day,
for certain days; after a little time the Wheals will fall off, and the Morphew
or redness will be cured.

4. Oleum Lacertarum, Oil of Lizards.

expressed Oil of Wallnuts, or Oil of Hypericon (which you please) lbv. Rhenish
Wine or Spanish vj. live green large Lizards No xvj, xx, xxvj. or more, as they
are in bigness: suffocate them in the scalding Oil, and make it exactly as Oil
of Vipers aforesaid, at Sect. 1.

In the making of these Oils of Animals, the Ancients caused them to be
insolated for many days, which caused them to putrify and make an insupportable
stink, whereby the Oil became infected with putrefaction and poison, rather
than any good quality; which Error be sure in all like cases to avoid. This Oil
is said to be a specific against Burstenness, or falling out of the
Intestines: it is also affirmed to make Hair grow thick, and upon bald places.
In Ruptures use it with a Truss, applying (after the part is well anointed) Our
Emplastrum ad Herniam.

5. Oleum Anydynum Nostrum; Our Oil easing Pain.

green leaves of Poppies, Henbane, Hemlock, A. lbj. bruise them well, and boil
them in Oil Olive lbiiij. boil till the Herbs are crisp, then strain out by
pressing, and repeat this work 3 times.

It is a most excellent Anodyne Oil in all Gouts, Sciatica's, tormenting and
excruciating Pains that I know of, and is a Medicine which will not fail in
Diseases proceeding from a hot Cause, if Camphir iij, be mixed with it, it will
be so much the better.

6. Oleum Hyperici Nostrum Compositum, Our Oil of Hypericon.

Hypericon, Rosemary, Lavender, A. xij. Camomil, Wormwood, Hyssop, Marjoram,
Bawm, Pennyroyal, Rue, Sage, Time, Savin, Bay Berries, Fennelseeds, A. iiij.
all being dry, make a strong infusion in Oil of Turpentine, Juniper Berries or
Aniseeds lbiiij. over a gentle fire, or in the Sun, for 60 days, then express
strongly, and mix therewith Oil Olive lbx.

It comforts the Joints and Nerves, is excellent good against the Palsy, Cramp,
Gout, Sciatica, and all external Diseases coming of cold; it refreshes wearied
Members, discusses Wind, and asswages Tumors; it is good against the Megrim,
Lethargy, Vertigo, and pains of the Liver and Spleen.

7. Oleum Cherinum Compositum Mayherni, Oil of Wall-flowers compound.

of the simple Oil of Wall-flowers ( which see in Our Pharmacopoeia, Lib. 5.
Cap. 2. Sect. 7.) lbij: common Salt decripitated and ground upon a Porphery to
a subtle powder; white Venice Soap, A. viij. mix, and make an Oil.

It prevails mightily against the Gour; in the Evening anoint all the Joints
with it, chiefly the Hands and Feet, or where the principal pain is; then going
to bed, put on Socks, Gloves, etc. There was a certain Learned Physician, who
had been afflicted with the Gout 30 years (he was Physician to the Duke of
Bovillon) he lived as many years more, and the residue of his Life (for he was
above an hundred years when he dyed) by the use and benefit of this Oil, was
free from his Distemper. And ten years before his Death, he was seen to walk as
firmly as if he had never been afflicted with this tormenting Disease.

8. Oleum Limacum compositum, Oil of Snails Compound.

black Snails in May, Aqua Vitae, A. lbj: Ox Galls No.j. Oils of Peter and of
Spike, A. ij: put them in a great Ox Bladaer, which tie fast, and put that into
another Bladder, and hang it up for 20 days, then strain it: after dissolve
therein Liquid Storax j: shake them all well together, once every day for a
Month, being put into a glass Bottle, and close stopped.

It is an admirable thing for all aches and pains coming almost from what cause
soever; it warms and comforts, and helps such as are numbed in their Limbs.

9. Oleum Lacertarum Sculteti, Lizard Oil of Scultetus.

green live Lizards, as many as you please, boil them in Oil Olive, till the
Lizards be burnt or grow crisp, and the Oil be black; then strain out, put it
into a Glass, and insolate till the dreggs fall down, and the Oil becomes
clear, and of a brown color.

It has the Virtues of the former at Sect. 4. but this is particularly a
specific (to anoint with) in the Kings Evil, applying over the Sores or
swellings (after anointing) the Ceratum Oxylaeum, softened whith this Oil: and
giving also inwardly every morning for thirty days together, vj. of Electuary
of Lizards, which Hercules Saxonia and Johannes Prevotius esteemed as a great
Secret, and certain Remedy for the cure of the King-Evil. The Electuary. Common
or green Lizards, (the Heads, Tails and Inwards cast away) infuse them by
themselves, in sharp white Wine Vinegar (made without Pepper) for four days:
Then dry them and sleep them in other Vinegar, and dry them again, either in
the shade or Sun, and powder them finely, which mix with four times its weight
of clarified Honey. Dose to Children ij: to Men or Women ss: or vj: or j: at
most, continuing it for 30 or 40 days.

10. Oleum Cosmeticum, An Oil softning and cleansing the Skin.

Oil of bitter Almonds new drawn viij: Oil of Tartar per deliquium, so much, or
in such a proportion as being well shaked together, the Oil may presently turn
white, like Cream, and so constantly remain: This Oil you may perfume with a
few drops of Oil of Rhodium, or of the Tincture of Ambergrise and Musk.

The Skin being first made very clean with warm Water and Wheat Bran, and then
dried with a cloth, is to be bathed Morning and Evening with this Oil, it will
make the Skin both soft and white, and free it from Sun-Burning, Pimples,
Tettars, Scurff, or any discolorings.

11. Oleum Amygdalarum dulcium per expressionem, Oil of Sweet Almonds by
Expression.

large, well grown, fresh, and well dried Almonds, blanch them in hot water,
taking off also the fine, thin membranous Skin; wipe them with a linen cloth,
and spread them abroad to dry. Then put them into a Marble Mortar, and beat
them with a wooden Pestle, till the pulp is very thin, and begin to yield Oil;
put this pulp into a bag of new strong linen Cloth, tie the mouth of it fast,
and put it between two thin tin Plates, or of wood lined with white Latten,
which place according to Art, in an Almond Press: squeeze it at first very
gently, but afterward with a considerable strength; leaving the bag in the
Press till the Oil has time to drop forth: If you press too strongly at first,
the Faeces of the Almonds would come through the bag, and the Oil would be
thick and filthy, which otherwise will be pure and clear.

1. The Ancients used to heat the Almonds, and such other like in B.M. after
they were beaten to a pulp, just before they went into the Press: it is true,
something more of Oil will be gotten that way, than by what is here delivered;
but then it will be less pleasing both to Taste and Smell. Some press the Oil
out without beating them to a Pulp, because the Almond Pulp will be less
subject to pass through the Bag, but then you will have yet something less of
the Oil. 2. Asthe same manner you may make Oils of other the like Kernells; as,

Oleum Amygdalarum amararum, Oil of Bitter Almonds.

Oleum Balanium, Oil of the Nut Ben.

Oleum Nucum Juglandium, Oil of Wallnuts.

Oleum Nucum Avellanarum, Oil of Hazle Nuts.

Olcum Crysomelinum, sen ex Nucleis Malorum Armeniacorum, Oil of Apricock
Kernels.

Oleum ex Nucleis malorum Persicorum, Oil of Peach Kernels.

3. Here is to be noted, that in making the Oil of Bitter Almonds, the beating
and heating may be omitted, but if you blanch them not, the dry red skin will
suck up part of your Oil. The bitterness lies only in the terrene part, the
Oils of both sorts of Almonds are alike sweet; this bitterness remaining in the
Faeces, although it be not hurtful to mankind, nor to the most part of other
Animals; yet it is most dangerous poison that Poultry can meet with. 4. In
drawing the Oils of Wallnuts, Hazle-Nuts, etc. you must avoid heating the
Pulps, if you use them inwardly, or for Cosmeticks, because then they are most
agreeable to the Taste and Smell. 5. The Nut Ben, is called by the Greeks
Balanus Mirepsica, by the Latins Glans Vnguentaria, from its Oily property. The
Nut is in some sorts ^riangular, covered with a whitish, thin, smooth, and
brittle rind: The substance of the Fruit is white, so is also the Oil, which is
without any kind of smell; nor will it ever grow rank, musty, stinking, or
otherwise ill sconted, and therefore is of good use among Perfumers. This Oil
of Ben is said to take away Freckles from the Face and Skin: I never proved it,
but if it be true, it may be accounted one of the greatest Arcana among Ladies.
Dropped into the Ears, it takes away their ringing noise. Taken inwardly in Wine
a ss. ad ij. it opens Obstructions of the Liver, Spleen and Mesentery.
Outwardly anointed it eases the Gout, and other pains of the Nerves and Joints.
6. After this self same manner may be drawn the

Oil of Pistaches, or Pistich Nuts.

Oil of Pineapple Kernells.

Oil of the four greater cold seeds:

Oil of Orange Kernells.

Oil of Limon Kernells.

Oil of Citron Kernells.

Oil of Palma Christi seed.

Oil of Peony seed.

Oil of Hemp seed.

Oil of Mustard seed.

Oil of Dwarf Elder seed.

Oil of Henbane seed.

Oil of Poppy seed.

Oil of Carthamus seeds.

Oil of Lettice seeds, etc.

12. Oleum Seminum Anisi per Expressionem, Oil of Aniseeds by Expression.

Aniseeds, new or fresh, well grown, and very dry lbj. cleanse them well, beat
and sift them through a close hair Sieve. Fill the hollow of a Plate that may
be set with the brims in the lower part of the hair sieve, cover the plate with
the lower part of the sieve; and keeping one hand upon the sieve, which must
then touch and cover the plate filled with the powder of Aniseeds; and the
other under the bottom of the plate: in an Instant turn the whole so that the
powder may fall upon the sieve and be covered with the plate: the same time
have in a readdiness a Copper Posnet to that bigness, that the bottom of the
sieve may rest wihin side, but not go down to the bottom: then put in three
pints of Water, and having placed the Skillet upon a Furnace, as the water
boyls, let the powder of the Aniseeds receive the vapor, for a quarter of an
hour, or till the boiling vapors of the water have well penetrated the powder,
and till you can no longer endure the heat of the plate which covers it: then
put the powder into a strong, close cloth bag, tie it fast, and put it into an
Almond Press, between two hot plates, and forthwith press it with all the speed
and strength that may be; so will a pound of powder of Aniseeds yield one Ounce
and an half, and sometimes two Ounces of Oil, having the true smell and taste of
Aniseeds.

This expressed Oil mightily expels Wind contained in the Belly, gives ease in
the Cholick and Griping of the Guts: it strengthens the Stomach, helps
Digestion, and eases the pain of the Ventricle. You may put a drop or two into
Broth, for Children that are troubled with the Gripes, also you may anoint it
upon the Stomach, Navel, and lower parts of the Belly. This Oil by expression
is less subtle and penetrative than that which is drawn by distillation,
however it has less Acrimony, and may therefore be given in greater quantity,
even to ss. in Wine, or some other proper Liquor. After the same manner in all
respects is drawn,

Oleum Nucis Moschatae, Oil of Nutmegs.

Oleum Macis, Oil of Mace.

Oleum Caryophyllorum, Oil of Cloves.

Oleum Piperis Jamaicae, Oil of Jamaica Pepper.

powder grossly, and cast all together into a Retort which digest for three days
in a boiling B.M. then lute it, and keep it in the hot Water till the Lute is
dry: after distill in Ashes, so will you have first a Water (which is called
water of Balsam,) which keep by it self; and then an Oil, which is the Balsam
desired: lastly, by increasing the fire, you will have a redish or black Oil or
Balsam.

It is of singular use in curing all Wounds, and in any part of the body,
especialy if used as soon as a wound is made, it then cures at once dressing
commonly: but if the Wound be corrupted, you must mix it with some Emplastick
body, least it should heal too soon, and the Pus which is afterward generated,
should excite grievous Symptoms. It comforts the Nerves, helps Palsies,
Numbness, Convulsions, Cramps, shrunk Sinews, old Aches, etc.

upon which affuse of the Vinegar of Saturn iij. (at Cap. 13. Sect. 1. of this
Book) stir them well together till the Oil and Wax be impregnated with the Salt
of Saturn, and the Composition becoms thick and white.

This Butter or Balsam of Saturn cools Inflammations, eases pains, is good in
Swellings of the Testicles and the Haemorrhoids, and alleviates the sharp
humors in an Erysipela's: it is also profitable in the Gout.

18. Balsamum Hyperici Compositum, Balsam of Hypericon Compound.

Spirit of Wine vj; dry flowers of Hypericon, as much as you can take up with
your thumb and four singers, digest in a very gentle heat, for four days; then
strain out by pressing: put this pressed liquor into a Mattress, to which put
Myrrh, Aloes, Sanguis Draconis (all in fine powder) A. j. put all in a sand

strain all through a linen Cloth, by pressing it while it is warm; after
which, dissolve it in Venice Turpentine, half an Ounce, by setting it for half
an hour in a gentle sand beat, so will you have an unctious and mucilaginous
Balsam.

It is most admirable in all green Wounds, Contusions, old Aches, and the
Sciatica, as also in a cold Gout.

19. Balsamum ad Cancrum, A Balsam against Cancers.

Gouts, ripens Apostems, heals old Sores, Cancerated Breasts, and for which last
it was particularly desi^ned: you may leave out the powder of Toads and Oil of
Soot, except only when you design it against Cancers.

Fire: let it boil a while; then take it off the Fire, and while it is yet
liquid, you may put it up into Boxes.

It is a good Balsam for any green Wound, performing the Cure for the most part
at one intention. It cures also old Sores, Ulcers, Fistula's, King's Evil
Sorces, Tumors or Swellings, Gout, etc. It is prevalent against the running
Gout, all sorts of lameness, any strain, bruise or pain whatsoever: it is also
profitable for pains in the side, disaffection of the Spleen, or pain and
weakness of the Back: this Balsam penetrates mightily, yet without pain.

21. Balsamum adversus maculam Paracelsi, A Balsam against marks or blemishes
in the healing of Wounds or Ulcers.

of the Liquor ad Ulcera Parcelsi (at sect. 13. cap. 1. of this Book) Oil of
Worms, Oil of Eggs, washed Turpentine, ana, mix them well together.

This Medicament causes the Wound or Ulcer to heal without a scar or blemish:
after this, there is nothing more requisite, for this is the property of this
Medicament, viz. to induce together with the new skin, a new color, and natural
hardness, so that it may not be defiled with the said blemishes.

22. Balsamum Nervinum Sculteti, A Balsam for the Nerves of Scultetus.

of the best Euphorbium in fine powder j: Turpentine, Wax, A. ss. mix, and make
a Balsam.

This was invented for the benefit of Barbers, who diverse times when they open
a Vein with a Lancet, do unskilfully hurt or prick the Nerves, which are near
or lay under it. In this case some Physicians cut the skin at right Angles,
that they may come at the Nerve, but this is a dangerous practice: others after
a cross incifion cut the Nerve also asunder, with good success; but this
increases the pain, and is the cause of Inflammation, and sometimes of
Convulsions. To Remedy these Evils, Scultetus invented this Balsam, which is
to be spread upon Linen and applied hot. With this alone presently applied; I
have safely cured (says he) diverse such Punctures of the Nerves. And he says,
It is an approved Remedy.

23. Balsamum liquidum ad Paralysin, A liquid Balsam for the Palsy.

Mast^rwort lbj. red Myrrh, Castoreum, A. j: flowers of Lavender, of Rosemary,
of Sage, A. vj. the three first things being in gross powder, put them into a
fit Vessel, and cover them 2 inches over, which with good Aqua Vitae or spirit
of Wine, digest ten or twelve days, in a warm place, close stopped, shaking the
Vessel five or six times a day; then strain out by gentle pressing: to this
expressed Liquor put Camphir x. dissolved in half a pint of spirit of Wine
rectified, or somewhat more, mix, digest, and keep them fou use.

It is a very good thing for the intention specified in the Title, wherein you
are to rub the Mould of the Head, Nape of the Neck, and all along the
Backbone, as also the parts afflicted. It is also good for all contractions of
the Nerves, by rubbing and chafing it well in: moreover it is a present Remedy
against the Gout in any Joint, as also for old Aches, Bruises, Cricks in the
Neck, Headaches, etc. by bathing the parts affected.

24. Balsamum Artificiale Nostrum, Our Artificial Balsam.

blood red Oil of Hypericon xxiiij. Venice or Chio Turpentine xij: Rosin, Wax,
A. ix. Oil of Nutmegs by Expression, Balsam of Peru, A. vj. Liquid Styrax iiij
ss. Gum Elemi depurated, red Myrrh in fine powder, A. iij. Oil of Ros^mary
Chemical, Camphir (dissolvd in Spir. of Wine rectified) Mastich (in fine
powder) A. jss. first heat the Oil of Hypericon, then dissolve therein the
Mastick, Wax and Rosin (being in little bits) after put in the Turpentine and
Balsam of Peru; being dissolved and well mixed, put in the Myrrh, after it the
Gum Elemi: next put in the Storax and Oil of Nutmegs, which being dissolved,
take all off from the fire; the heat being something abated, put in first the
Oil of Rosemary, which being mixed, then add lastly the Camphir dissolved in the
spirit of Wine, which stir continually, till the spirit of Wine is evaporatca,
and the Balsam perfected.

This is inferior to no Vulnerary Balsam whatsoever, but performs whatever any
of them all can pretend to; it cures Wounds although of the Nerves and Tendons,
and that almost in 24 hours: it preserves it safe and entire from filth,
putrefaction and dead or proud flesh, till it is perfectly healed, which is
commonly at once or twice dressing. It cases all external pains in any part of
the Body, as of the Gout, Sciatica, and such like, but much more effectually,
if you mix well there with Venice Scap a quarter part upon every application:
and it will be yet more effectual if Opium an eight part dissolved in S. V. be
added to the same. Being well bathed upon Sinews shrunk up, it relaxes and
comforts them, and causes them to extend to their due length. Laid upon the
Stomach, for an inward Bruise, it is of admirable and singular use, and will be
so much the more effectual if the quantity of afilbert be swallowed in the
morning fasting, fasting after it an hour and an half, and as much last at
night going to bed. Anointed upon Ruptures it consolidates them. If upon
occasion you mix with it a tenth part of pure fine prepared Verdigrise (so
prepared as we advise in Cap. 4. Sect. 13.. 2. following) or i thereof to j. of
this Ballam; it will cleanse and heal all manner of old Ulcers, hollow
cavernous fores, and fistula's whatsoever, taking away the calous proud or dead
flesh, the Synovia or joynt-water, or any other impediment which may hinder the
healing. It is good against old Aches, Sprains, withred Limbs, Cramps,
Convulsions, Tremblings, Numbness, etc. It asswages Pain in Sores, fills hollow
Ulcers with flesh, and heals them speedily, producing a Cicatrize: it safely
heals wounds without danger of ses^ring: In cases pains and stitches in the
sides; and applyd, softens the hardness of the Liver and Spleent Inwardly
taken, as aforesaid, it has been found by good Experience to give present Ease
in the Stone and gravel, whether in the Reins or Bladder.

Temples, the Sutures of the head, and the Nostrils, and let the sick carry

Besides being good against the Palsy, it is profitable in an Apoplexy, and all
other cold and moist Diseases of Head and Brain: Dose inwardly a gr. ij ad
iiij: outwardly anoint the Sutures of the Head, Temples and Nostrils, and all
along the back bone from the nape of the Neck to the very Buttocks. Let also
the sick often smell to it.

27. Balsamum Sulphuris commune, The common Balsam of Sulphur.

Oil of Wallnuts by Expression, or of Aniseeds by expression, lb ss, or vj:
flowers of Sulphur j: Salt of Tartar ij: Whitewine ij; put the Salt of Tartar
into a small Glass Cucurbit, to which put the White wine, dissolve, then put in
the flowers of Sulphur after the Oil: mix all well together, and set the Glass
over a gentle heat for 10 or 12 hours, stirring the Ingredients very often:
then augment the fire, and boil the Balsam till the moisture be almost
consumed. Take the Cucurbit from the Fire, and when cold, decant the pure
Balsam from the faeces, and keep it in a strong glass bottle for use.

It is of good use to digest Crude humors and indigested matter gathered
together in any part of the Body, being often anointed upon the same. The Salt
of Tartar is added to help the dissolution of the Flowers of Sulphur, and to
amplify the red color of the Balsam. You may also prepare it with Oil of
Almonds, Poppy seeds, Wallnuts, etc. And it may be made a compound Balsam by
adding thereto Myrrh, Aloes, and Saffron in a fit proportion, being all of them
first dissolved in Vinegar: not many better Balsams will succeed.

28. Balsamum ex Aloe, Balsam of Aloes.

fine Aloes iiij: powder and dissolve in a small quantity of Juice of Wormwood
red Myrrh ij: powder and make it soft with a sufficient quantity of the
Tincture of Wormwood, simple Oil of Wormwood (See it in Our Pharm. lib. 5.

strengthens the Brain, Stomach, Joints, and nerves to a miracle: it stops
Vomiting, causes a good Appetite, makes strong, weak and feeble limb^ and
comforts the nerves wonderfully: I once mixed this Balsam with a quarter part
of Mithridate, and applied it to all the joints of a Child which had the
Rickets for near 7 years, and was about 8 years old, and could not stand alone,
or use either hand: first I anointed all over with Oil of Amber; then I
applied the aforesaid Mixture: and in 6 weekstime the Child was perfectly well.
Anointed on the Belly, it kills Worms.

4. Vnguentum Regis Angliae, The King of England's Ointment.

pure Oil iij. white Wax, Rosin, A, ij. Turpentine j. Frankincense, Mastick, A.
ss. melt, mix, and make an Unguent.

There is scarcely a better Incarnative and Consolidative in the whole
Republic of Medicine than this Ointment; and if (in some cases) you add to it
Fine Aloes, choice Myrrh, A. j. it may be superior to any thing yet known.

5. Vnguentum Populneum Nostrum, Our Ointment of Popular Buds.

Popular buds lbij. black Poppies, Henbane, Nightshade, Mandrakes, Hemlocks,
Housleek, Lettice, Purslane, great Burdock, all green, A. viij. Opium vj. Hogs

It is a singular good Anodyn, giving ease in the Gout, Sciatica, Headache, and
all tormenting pains; it causes rest and sleep, and abates the heat of Fevers
and Inflammations, eases pains in the Reins. Note, that in putting in of the
Opium, you will do well to dissolve it first in Vinegar, then inspissate to the

an Ointment.

All Wounds are cured by this Ointment (provided the Nerves and Arteries, or
some of the principal Members be not hurt) thus: Anoint the Weapon that made
the Wound daily once, if there be need, and the Wound be great, otherwise it
will be sufficient to anoint it every other day. Where note, 1. That the Weapon
be kept in clean Linen, and in a temperate heat; for if the dust fall, or Wind
blow upon it, or it be cold, the Sick will be much tormented; so also if it be
kept too hot. 2. That if it be a Stab, the Weapon must be anointed toward the
point descending. 3. That if you want the Weapon, take Blood from the Wound
upon a stick, and use it as if it were the Weapon: Thus the Tooth ach is cured
by pricking the Gums, and anointing the Instrument.

all clean, hinders proud flesh. and suddenly perfects the Cure. It is eminent

Hands or Feet, or any other vehement pain; whether in the Joints or Stomach, by

mix all well, and make an Ointment.

It is prevalent against all Scubs, Itch, Scurst, Leprosy, and French Pox, for
which Diseases, I know no more certain outward Remedy; as also against all
Fluxes of Humors to any part, or in any Sore or Ulcer whatsoever. It abates
Inflammations, and the sharpness of Salt Humors, let it be chiefly anointed upon
the Joints once or twice: in the Pox, till a Flux arises; after which, let the
body be twice or thrice well purged.

Leprosies, and other breakings out in any part of the body. It cleanses and
purifies the Skin, takes away redness of the Face, red Pustles, and other the
like deformsties, by anointing therewith morning and evening. It is a good
thing in Manginess, and such like breakings out.

12. Vnguentum Fuscum, The brown Ointment.

Oyl-Olive, Goat or Deers Suet, A. ix. Bees Wax iiij. Greek or Burgundy Pitch,
common black Pitch, A. ij. Ammoniacum, Opopanax, Galbanum, (dissolved in
Vinegar, and brought to a Consistency) Mastich, Frankincense, Turpentine, A. j
Sagapenum (dissolved in Vinegar) ij. melt, mix, and make an Ointment.

in Tumors, Wounds and Ulcers. It ripens and breaks all sorts of Apostems,
Pestilential Carbuncles and Venereal Buboes. It is cleansing, opening,
attractive, and anodyn, giving ease in the Gout.

13. Vnguentum Fuscum Wurtzij, Felix Wurtz his brown Ointment.

Scrophulary, Ground Ivy, Speedwel, A. M. j. cut them small, put them into a
Bolt Head or Glass Vesica, upon which put good Wine Vinegar, so much as to
overtop them the breadth of two fingers: stop all up close, and digest in a
warm sand heat for a week: then strain out the Vinegar, by pressing hard in a
press. Take of this Vinegar iij. abstersive Sulphur of Vitriol, Phlegm of
Vitriol, A. ij. flos aeris x. Honey clarified vj. mix and boil to an Ointment.

1. Here is to be noted, First, that the way of making the abstersive Sulphur
of Vitriol, is expressed in lib. 2. cap. 9. sect. 7. aforegoing. 2. That the
preparation of the Verdigrise for this purpose is in this manner: powder it,
upon which put distilled Vinegar viij. digest till the Vinegar is tinged very
green; which decant and cast away the saeces, then evaporate the Vinegar in a
brass Vesica, so have you a glorious colored Verdigrise at the bottom, of
which one ounce is worth x. of the former. 2. That this Unguent is of principal
use for Wounds of the jounts, especially if you fear any manner of ill Symptoms
approaching; and in general for all manner of other Wounds whatsoever, being
much better than the common Aegyptiacum. 4. That it not only cleanses Wounds
and preserves them from Inflammations, corrosive Humors, and all other Symptoms
and malignity, but also mightily helps their healing. 5. That this Unguent may
be boiled to a hard^ess, to make Tents of, which may be put to the bottom of
deep Wounds or Stabs, where it, melting by degrees, lays a sure Foundation for
the Cure, and resists all things which hinders it. 6. But as in other things,
so in this, a moderate use is to be observed: use it not every day, especially
when the Wound is in a good condition, nor when there is no occasion for it,
but only when you see necessity requires it: all which you will find out by
practice, better than by many words.

14. Vnguentum Cosmeticum Barbetti, a beautifying Ointment.

iij: melt and mix them, adding the finely poudred Aloes, when they are almost

Consumption of the aqueous humidity; then strain, and add Venice Turpentine vj:
Gum Elemi x: Wax, enough to give it the consistency of an Unguent: these two

It is a most incomparable Vulnerary, being as Mindererus says, of great
efficacy, both for cleansing and healing, not only of green Wounds, but also of
all old Ulcers whatsoever, and in what part of the body soever: esteem it as a
Jewel.

eradication thereof. It is of the nature of Nutritum or Tripharmacum, in Our
Pharm. Lib. 5. Cap. 4. Sect. 18. but this is more powerful and sympathetical to
all those intentions, by reason of the addition of the Mummy. You may also
apply it successfully against all manner of Burnings and Scaldings.

choice Myrrh ij: Turpentine j ss: melt, mix and make an Ointment.

It is inferior to no one thing in cleansing all putrid, for did and foul
Ulcers, especially such as are hollow or cavernous, which it does without any
biting at all; let linen rags be dipped therein, and put into the cavity of the
Ulcer. Value this as a Jewel in all Ulcers which have thin ichorus Excrements
and Impurities.

Medicine a cancerous Yard was cured.

27. Vnguentum Mercuriale Sennerti, Mercurial Ointment of Sennertus.

spatula, till the whole has the consistency of an Ointment. When you have an
occasion to use it, to every iij, put Quicksilver killed with fasting spittle)
ss: or the Quick silver may be shaken together with the white of an Egg.

With this Ointment you may cure within 15. days all manner of Scabbiness,
whatsoever it be: Or those Sirones which are accompanied with Itching. It is
also an excellent good thing against the Itch, and against the breakings out of
the French Pox, and Tumors and Nodes thence proceeding.

wasted, then strain and press strongly, to which straining (being almost cold)
add Myrrh, fine Aloes, A. iiij: roots of round Bithwort, Florentine Orrice, A.
ij: all in fine powder, mix them all well together.

It is an excellent Vulnerary, cleanses and heals Wounds to admiration. It is
good against the hitings of mad Dogs, and other venomous creatures; prevails
against Cramps, Palsies, Numbness, Weakness, and pains of the Nerves, Joints,
and other parts, etc. Some take the Juyces of the Herbs, but the Juyces alone
cannot impart so great Virtues to the Medicine, as the complete Herbs can; nor
can they impart to this or any other Ointment their green color; unless they be
boiled with their Herbs.

29. Vnguentum Hederae terrestris, Ointment of Ground Ivy.

May Butter lbvj: Ground Ivy bruised, M. vj. boil to crispness: strain out by
pressing, and boil in the Liquor M. vj. more: do so the third time, then strain
out, and keep it in a glazed pot for use.

It cures Pearls and Spots in the Eyes to a wonder, with other the like
Distempers, by putting into the Eye about half the quantity of a Pea, morning
and night, and then binding over it a cloth dipped in the Liquor Stypticus, at
Sect. 10. Cap. 1. of this Book.

30. Vnguentum ad Porriginem, An Ointment against the Itch.

All these are of extraordinary use in curing of Scabs, Itch Tettars,
Ringworms, Herpes, or any other breakings out of the Skin, by anointing
therewith: The first is the best and the most powerful, but the most dangerous,
and therefore ought to be used with caution.

31. Vnguentum Evae, Ointment of Eve.

Oil Olive lb j: Marrow of an Ox Leg, yellow Wax, Rosin of the Pine Tree, A.
ij: fresh Butter iij: mix and make an Ointment.

That this was invented by our old Mother Eve, is more than I can prove, for
all that it bears her name: however it softens Tumors, discusses and is Anodyn:
It takes away Inflammations and eases pain. Foscarinus it was that brought it
with him out of Turkey.

32. Vnguentum ad Paralysin Valeriolae, Ointment against the Palsy.

Sage, sweet Marjoram, Betony, Bays, Rosemary and Primrose leaves, A. M. j:

Marrow of an Ox bone ij: Juyces of Dwarf Elder, Sage, Bawm, A. iiij: Propolis
ij: mix, and with a sufficient quantity of Bees Wax melted into the aforesaid
Oils; make them into the consistency of a thin Ointment or Liniment.

This is much commended by Valeriola, in his Observations for the purposes
intended; doubtless it strengthens any weak part, takes away lassitudes, and
watery Humors from any Member: In the Palsy anoint all along the backbone
warm, laying of Wool or fine Flannel warm thereon.

33. Vnguentum Paralyticum Riverij; Palsy Ointment of Riverius.

Juyces of Squills iiij: Juyces of Cucumber and Rue, A. j: Euphorbium, Castor,
Sagapenum, Ammoniacum, Bdellium) dissolved in Vinegar) A. j ss: Myrrh;
Frankincense, Pyrethrum, Niter, A. j: Oils of Elder, Turpentine and Euphorbium,
A. ss: Wax a sufficient quantity, make an Ointment.

It is a powerful Ointment in the Palsy, and in all cold, moist and paralytick
Distempers of the Limbs, anoint all the Backbone therewith and the parts
affected; it would be good to use it, chiefly after bathing or sweating; for
then the pores and passages of the Skin, being open, do the more easily receive
the Ointment.

34. Vnguentum Johannis Prevotij, The Ointment of John Prevotius.

Tobacco leaves, middle bark of Elder, A. M. j: roots of white Asphodel thinly
sticed j: Oil Olive lbj: boil away the humidity upon a gentle fire, and press
them strongly out, to which add Frankincense in fine powder ss: Wax vj: mix,
and make a Liniment.

It is a very excellent thing to cure ulcerated Chilblains or Kibes, in the
Feet of Children or Elder people: The said John Prevotius deservedly commends
it in his Medicines for the Poor; I have always oftentimes used it, and never
found it fail. It presently heals ulcerated Chilblains or Kibes on the Nostrill
Ears or Hands.

35. Vnguentum seu Linimentum simplex, The simple soft Ointment.

Juice of Nightshade, newly expressed, Oil of Roses, A. xx. boil them according
to Art, till the Juice be boiled away: strain out, and add thereto Litharge of
Gold, Ceruse, A. lb j: mix according to Art, and make an Ointment or Liniment.

It is cooling, drying, and resisting the heat of Inflammations, being in an
Erisipelas and confirmed Cancer.

36. Vnguentum ad Lepram Graecorum, Sculteti; An Ointment for the Leprosy.

Pomatum, Oil of Tartar per deliquium, A. ij: Flowers of Sulphur ij ss: or iij:
Balsam of Peru ij: melt, mix, and keep stirring till it is cold.

He first caused the sick to bath in fair warm Water, in which Fumitory,
Mallows, Speedwel and Elecampane were boiled; then he anointed with this
Ointment, he caused the ordinary drink to be Decoction of China, and often to
take the Electuarium ad Lepram, in Lib. 2. Cap. 22. Sect. 19. and anointed the
Back with Fat of Vipers.

37. Vnguentum de Betonica, Ointment of Betony.

Juyces of Betony iij. of Burnet, of Wood-bind, of Comfrey, A. ss. Malmsey v.
boil away the Wine, then add Turpentine ij. Sheeps suet, Oil of Roses, A. j.
powder of Mastich, Myrrh, Mummy, A. j ss. Verdigrise ij. Wax. q.s. mix and make
an Ointment according to Art.

It is a good thing to digest, cleanse and incarnate all green Wounds, more
especially if they be in the Cranium or Head: by its application it prevents
evil Symptoms, and renders the healing more secure.

38. Vnguentum seminum Hyoscyami, Ointment of Henbane Seed.

Henbane seeds poudred, j: burnt Alum, burnt Vitriol, A. ss. Butter (meited and
washed in Plantane Water) q.s. mix and make an Ointment.

Its use is to consume the Callous or hardness of a Fistula: which is done by
diping a Tent therein, and putting it into the Fistula: afterward it ought to
be tented ( viz. when the Callous is removed) with such things as may prevent
the breeding of a Callous: such as is this following mixture. Unguent. de
Betonica j: Vng. Aegyptiac. ss: malax them well together for the purpose
aforesaid.

39. Vnguentum Mercuriatum, An Ointment of Mercury precipitate.

Mercury precipitate, burnt Alum, Verdigrise, salt Peter, A. whites of Eggs a
sufficient quantity; mix and make an Ointment.

This presently extirpates the Callous of Fistula's, a linen Tent being
covered over herewith, and so applied: but it does not the work so pleasantly
nor safely in parts Nervous, or such as are endowed with exquisite sense. The
Callous being removed, the Ulcer may be cleansed with Aegyptiacum, and
incarnated with Vngde Betonica, and consolidated with Ceratum Divinum; and, if
there be any relics of a hard Tumor, you may dissolve it with Ceratum
Oxelaeum: This Ointment is admirably applicable to Fistula's of the Breast.

40. Vnguentum contra Vermes, An Ointment against Worms.

Aloes Epatick iij: Extract of Gentian j: red Myrrh vj: Extract of Wormwood ij:
Extract of Colocynthis ss: spirit of Rhenish Wine iiij: OxGall vij ss: Oil of
Wormwood by boiling viij: powder fine what is to be poudred; mix and boil in a
double Vessel to the consumption of the humidity of the Gall and S.V. then add
yellow Wax q.s. mix and make an Ointment.

You are to anoint herewith from the Stomach to the Groin over the whole Belly,
and that every day, morning and evening, for some certain time: It kill Worms
in Children, and brings them away by stool.

41. Vnguentum contra pediculas, An Ointment for the Lousy Evil.

Oil of Bays viiij; juice of Rue vj: boil to the consumption of the juice, then
add Quicksilver killed with fasting spittle j ss: seeds of Staves-Acre, Niter
prepared, Aloes Epatick, A. ss: roots of white Hellebore, of sharp pointed
Dock, Indian Tobacco, A. ij: Camphir, Oil of Spike, A. j: and with Wax, q. s.
mix and make an Ointment.

It is an approved thing for the purpose intended, but you must use it with
care and caution, and take heed of getting cold.

42. Vnguentum ad Luem Veneream, An Ointment for the French Pox.

Hogs Lard xij: Oil of Hypericon j: Vnguentum Aragon ij: Frankincense ss:
Ceruse ij: Mercury precipitate iiij: mix over a gentle heat, and make an
Ointment.

The use is the same with that of Vng. Neapolitanum, It powerfully helps all
Pocky Sores and Ulcers; and dissoves Gums, Tophs, and Nodes, if the Bone be not
corrupted, you must use it wisely and cautiously: by precipitate here is meant
the white, which is much the better for this purpose.

CHAP. V. Of CERATES.
1. CEratum ad Cadavera, A Cerecloth to wrap up dead Bodies in.

Bees Wax lbxxv. Turpentine, Colophony, Rosin, A. lbiij. Ship Pitch lb ijss.
Frankincense, liquid Storax, A. lbij. Oil of Spik lbss. Verdigrise lbj. melt
and mix, adding to it Oil of Roses lbij, or more, in which dip the Cloth.

It is intended only to wrap up dead Bodies in, whether Embowelled or not: The
Embalmer may make the Cloth so large, as that it may go 4, 5, or more times
about the Body.

2. Ceratum aliud ad Cadavera, Another Cerecloth for the same purpose.

Burgundy Pitch lbx. Rosin, Frankincense, A. lbvj. Aloes, Myrrh, A. lbj. Oil of
Spike lbss: Oil of Cloves distilled j: Oil of Mace by Expression iij. Sheeps
Suet q.s. melt, mix, and make a Cerate.

The uses and intentions are altogether the same with the former: In the making
of this latter you must be very careful, for otherwise the Burgundy Pitch will
not easily mix, but harden in a lump, if the fire be too hot, therefore the
fire ought to be gentle.

3. Ceratum Divinum Sculteti, Divine Cerecloth of Scultetus.

Gum Ammoniacum, Galbanum, Opopanax, Bdellium, powder of Myrrh, Frankincense,
Mastich, long Birthwort, Verdigrise, Cadmy prepared, Lapis Haematites, A. j.
Litharge of Gold, Oil O^ive A. lbj. yellow Wax, Turpentine, A. vj. melt, mix,
and make them up into a Cerate.

It conglutinates Ulcers very speedily, hinders the growing of any bad flesh,
and forthwith cicatrizes a Wound.

4. Ceratum Diasinipi ab Aquapendente, Cerate of Mustard seed.

Sal Gem, Litharge of Gold, Ceruse, A. iiij. Wax, Turpentine, A. ij. Galba^^um,
Opepanax, A. ss. ^ustard Seed poudred ij. ^^d Oil ix. sharp Vinegar, q.s. mix
and make a soft Cerate according to Art.

He prescribes it against a Meliceris, and such like Tumors; for it warms,
comforts the parts, and discusses mightily.

5. Ceratum Citrinum ab Aquapendente, The yellow Cerecloth.

Juice of Tobacco vj: new yellow Wax iiij. Rosin iij. Turpentine ij. Oil of
Myrtles q. s. make a soft Cerate.

It is a powerful dissolver of Tumors, and easer of pain; it strengthens weak
Limbs, and restores such as are withred and have lost the use of them: It
cleanses, fills up with flesh, and heals old Ulcers, and other filthy running
Sores; and cures green Wounds almost in a moment.

6. Ceratum pro Fonti^ulis Sculteti, Scultetus his Sparadrap for Issues.

Cerate of white Lead or Album Coctum xij: Ceruse in powder iiij: Frankincense,
Gum Tragacanth, A. vj: Florentine Orrice, Benjamin, A. v: liquid Styrax, Oil of
Spike, A. ij. Venice Soap ij: Wax ij: or a sufficient quantity, mix, melt, and
make a Sparadrap according to Art. You may add a little Musk to it, to make it
smell the more pleasant.

It is to be spread upon new Linen Cloth; with this Sparadrap, says
Scultetus, for two and twenty years, I have preserved above a thousand Issues,
from all evil Symptoms, to the admiration of all that used it.

7. Ceratum Ducis Hetruriae, Cerecloth of the Duke of Tuscany.

Juice of Ivy lbiij: Juice of Tobacco, Turpentine, pure Rosin, Ointment of
Roses Mesue, yellow Wax, A. lbj: Oil of Nutmegs ij: powder of sweet Cypress j:
pure Ceruse lbj: mix, melt, and make a Cerate.

It is chiefly designed to keep Issues from all ill Symtoms, and therefore the
use of this is the same with the former.

8. Ceratum Oxylaeum, Cerecloth of Vinegar and Oil.

common old Oil lbj: sharp Wine Vinegar, Litharge of Gold, A. lbss. mix upon a
gentle fire, till they come to the consistency of a soft Cerate.

It discusses, drys, eases pain, strengthens the part, and is beneficially
applied to Cancers whether ulcerated or not.

9. Caratum ad Tophos Sculteti, Scultetus his Cerecloth against Nodes.

Quick silver (killed with fasting spittle) ss: powder of Indian Tobacco ss:
Diachylon with Gums, Ceratum Oxylaeum, Ceratum Citrinum, A. j. distilled Oil of
Guajacum j: mix, and make a Cerecloth.

This Cerecloth is used against Pocky Nodes and Gums, when they will not be
cured by Medicaments given by the Mouth, as Sarsa, which far more easily and
quickly cures all knots and Accidents of the French Pox, than Guajacum does:
the Author commends this Cerat as an admirable thing in the case specified: but
if for all this the Shins shall continually ache, and the Gummosity will not be
discussed, it is a most certain sign that the bone under the Node is corrupted;
and therefore it is necessary to make incission upon the Node along the
Shin-bone, with an Incission Knife, which being uncovered must be scraped away
with scraping Tools, where it is corrupted. The first day the Node is to be cut
with an Incission Knife, upon the length of the Shinbone, unto the Bone it
self; then the Wound is to be dilated with Tow or Hempen hards, wet in the
white of an Egg beaten, and the leg must be swathed with a convenient Ligature,
to keep off a flux of Humors. On the second day you must take off the hards,
and lifting up the Wound artificially, having first very well defended the
found parts about it, that they may take no hurt, you must fill it with a
Caustic; that of Ambrose Paraeus, which he has described Lib. 26. Cap. 32.
under the name of Holosericum, is admirable in this case; he calls them
Holosericum Silken or Velvet Cauteries, for that they are like silk, gentle,
and without pain; moreover he obtained them of a Chemist, by many entreaties
and a piece of Velvet, from whence came the name. of the Ashes of Beans Stalks,
and the Ashes of Oak Wood well burnt, A: lbiij: let them be infused in a pretty
quantity of River water, and be often stirred up and down; then add thereto of
unquenched Lime lbiiij: which being quenched, stir it now and then together for
two days space, that the Capitellum may become the stronger; then strain it
through a thick and strong linen cloth, and thus strained, put it three or
four times upon the Ashes, that so it might draw more of the caustic faculties
from them, then boil it in a Barbers Basin, or else in an earthen pan well
leaded, upon a good Charcole Fire, till it becomes thick. But a great part of
the Secret or Art, consists in the manner and limit of this boiling; for this
Capitellum becoming thick and concreeting into Salt, must not be kept so long
upon the fire, until all the moisture shall be vanished and spent by the heat
thereof: for thus the force also of the aforesaid Medicines, which also
consists in a spirituous substance, will be much dissipated and weakened:
therefore, before it come to extreme dryness, it shall be taken from off the
fire, to wit, when as yet there shall some thick moisture remain, which may not
hinder the Cauteries to be made up into a form. The made up Cauteries shall be
put up into a Glass, most closely stopped, that the Air may not dissolve them,
and then set up in a dry place for use. But to proceed to our former matter;
this Caustic being laid on, cover it with a Plaster extended all the breadth
of it, but not going round about the Leg: bind the Leg again with a pressing
band according to Art. On the third day, removing all these things, apply such
things as will make the Escar fall off: when that is taken away, scrape away
the rottenness unto the quick; and then with drying pouders cover the Bone with
flesh. Thus you see the Node is first cut, that the Caustic may sooner come to
act, yet incission is not always necessary, unless it be for those who will
hardly believe the Chyrurgian when he tells them that the Bone is rotten, until
such time as they see it or touch it themselves.

10. Ceratum Johannis Praevotij; The Cerecloth of Praevotius.

Millet Meal ij: Oil of Roses, stirred up in a leaden Mortar iij: Ponder of
crude Lead ss: Golden Rod, Sowthistle, Night shade poudered, A. ij: new Wax ij,
vj: Pino Rosin x: mix, melt, and make a Cerate.

This was designed for to resolve and cure Cancers, which Experience has
confirmed, being applied after due purging. Scultetus applied it to a Cancer in
a Woman's Breast, arising from the stoppage of her Terms, and he says, it did in
three Months space insensibly dissolve the Tumor: In the mean time, seeing that
her courses which had been stopped for two years, could not be brought down by
remedies, he made her an Issue on the inward part of each Thigh, to the end
that the offending matter might be brought down to the lower parts, and he kept
them open a year, least the Humors should gather together again, and offend
some other part. The Purge which ought to be given several times before hand,
(because of the exquisiteness thereof) we will here incert, and it is this.
Confect^^ Hameth vj: Extract of black Hellebor j: Cream of Tartar ss: decoction
of flowers and Fruits, q. s. mix them.

11. Ceratum Paraliticum Riverij; A Cerecloth for the Palsy.

Emplaster of Betony, Melilot and Bay Berries, A. j: Frankincense, Seeds of
Nigella or Gith, seeds of Watercresses and Mustard, Roots of Pyrethrum, Sal
Niter, A. ss: Castoreum, E^phorbium, A. j. with Oil of Bricks, q. s. make a
Cerecloth.

The Title shows the intention, for which it is a singular good thing: some
spread it upon new thick cloth, which I think is the better; but Riverius
advises it to be spread upon Leather.

12. Ceratum Diasulphuris, Cerecloth of Sulphur Compound.

Oil of Ben, or of Wallnuts by Expression lbj: flowers of Sulphur ij: Oil of
Tartar j: digest all together in a moderate sand heat, till the flowers of
Sulphur are dissolved in the Oil, decant the clear liquor into a brass
Drying Pan Tinned within, and over a gentle fire; melt therein, yellow Wax
iiij: Colophony iij: then taking the Pan from the fire and stirring the matter
till it is half cold, mix therewith red Myrrh finely poudred, the full weight
of all the other ingredients ( viz. xxij:) and the Searcloth is done.

It Is excellent to soften and dissolve scrophulus Tumors, and all other kind of
external swellings, proceeding from a cold matter, hard to dissolve. It is also
a specific in dissolving Tumors in Scroto, arising from Venereal Venom, and in
cleansing all sorts of Ulcers. Spread it upon Linen or thin Leather, and apply
it to the part affected: but when you apply it to the Testicles, make use of a
kind of Purse and Swathing band.

13. Ceratum Refrigerans, A cooling Cerecloth.

Oil of Roses lb j: white Wax iij: slice the Wax, which put with the Oil into a
glazed Earthen pot: dissolve the Wax in the Oil in B. M. then taking off the
Vessel, continually keep stirring it till it be cold, adding in the mean season
fair Water ij: and continuing the same stirring: when this Water is drunk up
add more, and continuing the stirring; still add more water, till you find it
has enough, and the Cerate is white enough; after decant the Water, and put up
the Cerate for use: some mix Spirit of Vinegar one Ounce therewith to make it
more piercing.

This was of Hippocrates his Invention, and a good thing it is in easing and
cooling of all sorts of Inflammations, in what part of the Body soever, by being
anointed thereon, and lint diped therein applied over it. It is very good
against heat of the Reins, Phlegmons, Erysipela's, Tettars, and such like: It
is approved in easing the pain, and allaying the heat of the Hemorrhoids or
Piles, and to cure crackings, chapings, and peelings of the Skin in the Lips,
Hands, and other parts. It allays Inflammations, and heals Galings of the Thighs
and other parts in little Children, and in such as are fat and pursy: It cures
Chappings and other Sores in Women's Breasts, and their Nipples, and is very
good against Burnings: when there is need of drying and skinning, you may mix
it with a fit proportion of Unguent um Album.

14. Ceratum Stomachicum Commune, The common Stomach Cerecloth.

Oil of Quinces lbiij: white Wax lbj: red Myrrh, red Roses, A. v: Wormwood
dried iiij: Indian Spicknard ij ss: melt the Wax in the Oil, in a glazed
Earthen Vessel, and stir it till it begins to thicken, then add the other
Ingredients in fine powder.

Some in the place of Myrrh put so much Mastich; both are good, you may take
which you like best; for my part I prefer the Myrrh: Some also melt the Gum in
part of the Oil, being first made into fine powder, and then mix this
dissolution with the dissolution of the Wax in the other part of the Oil. The
Title shows the Intention; it strengthens the Stomach, helps digestion,
provokes an Appetite, stops Vomiting, digests bad Humors, and expels Wind: let
it be applied hot to the Stomach.

15. Ceratum Aromaticum, A sweet scented Cerecloth.

white Wax lbvj: Oil of Nutmegs by expression, distilled Oil of Lavender,
distilled Oil of Orange and Cltron Peels, A. ij: melt the Wax over a gentle
fire in a Copper Basin Tinned over, large above and narrower below: put in the
Oil and mix them well: then dip therein Linen Coth of an indifferent fineness.

This was designed to wrap up dead Carcases in, and may be used instead of
those at Sect. 1. and 2. of this Chapter, though for my part, I judge either of
them to be better. This is good to be applied in weakness of the Nerves, and
upon Paralitick Members.

16. Ceratum ex Betonica, Cerecloth of Betony.

Turpentine iij: Pine Rosin, yellow Wax, A. ij: Betony in powder, Rosemary and
Lavender flowers, A. ss: Mastich, Frankincense, red Myrrh, A. ij: Mummy, Gum
Ivy, A. j ss: mix and make a Cerate.

It is good to apply to the Crown, Sutures, and Temples of the Head, to prevent
defluxions of Rheum; It comforts and strenghens any weak part, eases pain, and
heals any green Wound.

17. Ceratum ad prohibendum abortum Milij, A Cerecloth to prevent Abortion.

Oil of Olives, or of Quinces or of Myrtles lbiij: Mastich j: Laudanum vij Wax
ss: Bistort, Cypress Nuts, Hypocistis, Acacia, red Roses, red Coral, fine Bole,
dried Mint, Coriander seeds, Terra Sigillata, A. ij. Venice Turpentine q. s.
mix, and boil to the thickness of a Cerate.

In my Opinion there is too little Wax, or else you must make a very long
boiling, which cannot be so well: first boil the Oil, Mastich, Wax and
Turpentine to a due consistency; then strew in the Pouders, and at last add the
Laudanum: the Wax and Turpentine may be of each iij: and some instead of
Laudanum Opiatum take Labdanum, but the former is more to our pupose, which you
may add to j.

CHAP. VI. Of EMPLASTERS.
1. EMplastrum ad Herniam Nostrum, Our Plaster for Ruptures.

Ox Gall No vj. Myrrh lbij:Turpentine lbj: Bees Wax, Ship Pitch, A. lb ss. boil
all nearly to the thickness of an Emplaster; to which, whilst hot^, add Mumms,
Lodestone, both in fine powder, A. vj: mix them, and stir till it is nearly

It is one of the most powerful things in the World to consolidate a Rupture,
or knit broken Bones; and to strengthen any weak or feeble part.

then make it like a hasty Pudding, with fine flower, either of Wheat or Rye,

Lay this a fingers thickness upon new flannel cut into three distinct pieces;
so as that they might (if sewed together) make a Cap fit for the Head: Apply it
warm to the Scald, dress it twice a day, taring it (when you are a going to
dress it) violently off from the scald, so will it pull out the hair by the
Roots: but before you apply it, let the hair be first clipped short with Sissars
and not shaved. This application so often repeat, till all the hair is pulled off
by the roots, the Scabs are wholly vanished, and it has perfectly don running.
Every time you dress it, wash it with Urine of another person mixed with a
little Wine, then lay on the pultice again warm; after a little while it will
harden like a stone upon the Head, which is (as aforesaid) to be torn violently
off from the Head every dressing. When the Head is well, the hair will come
thick and well again.

which add Meal of Lin-seed and Fenugreek Seed, Oil of Lillyes, A. iij ss. boil
all together over a gentle fire, continually stirring the Mass, till it is of a
due consistence.

brings them to a more speedy suppuration.

9. Cataplasma ex stercore humano, a Cataplasm of the Dung of Humane kind.

Make a strong Lixivium of Quicklime, so that the water may supernate five or
six inches: decant and add Man's Dung so much as may make it of the consistence

This seems to be as a Divine Remedy, sent from Heaven, for the cure of all
such poor Mortals as labor under continual running Sores, hollow Fistula's,
putrid, virulent and malignant Ulcers, eating Cancers, and such other like
rebellious Diseases; although of twenty years standing, and resisting all
Remedies; these deplorable Maladies, this Medicine takes away by the roots, as
it were by Enchantment, drawing away all the filthiness, corruption, malignity,
stench, putrefaction, venom, vir^lency, and poison; so that commonly at two,
three, or four applications, but scarcely ever exceeding the seventh time of
applying, the poor Patient becoms well, and perfectly freed from his tormenting
companion: it is almost miraculous, that it should overcome the malignity and
poison of virulent and eating Cancers (which some call the Wolf, and totally
master it in so short a time, as this will certainly do it: in truth it can be
applied to no outward old Sore in vain, and what are really uncurable by all
other Medicines, are certainly cured by this, and that both safely and
speedily. There is a reason for this in nature, which I cannot stand now to
give.

Cummin-seed, of Fennel-seed and of Bay berries, A. j. mix and make a Cataplasm,
as at Sect. 8. above.

digest them if need be: otherwise to dissolve and discuss them by transpiration
through the Pores.

from the Grave, and saved me from the Jaws of Hell, making me to break its
cords asunder; who has made me to survive Envy, and to wade through a Sea of
Lies, designed Calumnies and Slanders: and has caused me to triumph over the
false and lying Tongue: who pointed out to me the Snare, and has delivered me
from the Power of the Sorceress: To him whose Almighty Power, under all this
great Burden has sustained me, and whose Right Hand has thus admirably upheld
me, who has put into my heart his Fear, and impressed upon my Soul the
Character of his Holiness: who has dealt with me after a wonderful manner, and
made me largely to partake of his loving Kindnesses, even in the midst of
Judgment so that his Rod became a Staff unto me. My Soul in Testimony of
abundant Thankfulness, offers up to my compassionate GOD a perpetual Sacrifice
of Praise and Thanksgiving; to whom belongs all Power, Dominion, Honor, Glory
and Renown now and ever. Amen.
